*   **Lenalidomide's Approval and Use:** Lenalidomide, often in combination with rituximab, has been approved for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.
*   **Generic Entry:** While a generic version of Latuda (lurasidone hydrochloride) is available, this is a different drug from lenalidomide.
*   **Patent Information:** For OPZELURA (ruxolitinib), the earliest generic entry date is estimated to be December 12, 2028, but this is also a different drug.

*   **Biologics and Exclusivity:** Biologics have a 12-year FDA market exclusivity period, separate from patent protection.
*   **Patent Thickets:** Biosimilar competitors face challenges due to patent litigation timelines.

Given that lenalidomide was approved before December 2024, determining the exact patent expiration date requires considering the original approval date, any patent extensions, and potential challenges.

**Part 1: Identifying the ingredient starting with 'V' in clinical trial NCT02755597**

Based on the search results, clinical trial NCT02755597 (BELLINI trial) studied a combination of Venetoclax, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Therefore, the ingredient starting with the letter ""V"" is **Venetoclax**.

**Part 2: Patent expiration date of Valbenazine**

The ingredient identified is **Valbenazine**. Valbenazine was first approved by the FDA on April 11, 2017, under the brand name Ingrezza.

**Part 1: Identifying the ingredient starting with 'D' in NCT00833833**

Clinical trial NCT00833833 concerns a study of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Based on the search results, the more effective regimen ingredients include:

*   Dexamethasone

Therefore, the ingredient starting with the letter 'D' is **Dexamethasone**.

**Part 2: Patent Expiration Date of Dexamethasone**

Determining the precise patent expiration date for dexamethasone is complex. Here's what the search results indicate:

*   **General Patent Information:** A drug patent typically lasts for 20 years from the filing date. However, this can vary due to factors like new formulations or litigation.
*   **Dexamethasone Use:** Dexamethasone is often used in combination with other drugs.
*   **Patent Thickets:** Companies can create ""thickets"" of patents related to dosing, formulations, etc., potentially extending market exclusivity.

Given the complexity and the lack of a definitive expiration date within the provided search results, I can't provide a specific year.

",NCT,False,,"The response does not provide any specific year or date as the patent expiration date for dexamethasone.

**1. Identifying the Ingredient:**

Clinical trial NCT01973387 investigates treatments for relapsed or refractory chronic leukemia/lymphoma. One study related to this trial examines the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PCI-32765, in combination with rituximab. PCI-32765 is also known as Ibrutinib. Therefore, the ingredient starting with ""I"" in a more effective regimen is **Ibrutinib**.

**2. FDA Approval Date for Ibrutinib:**

The FDA granted regular (full) approval for Ibrutinib for two indications on **July 28, 2014**.

**3. Patent Expiration Date:**

Determining the exact patent expiration date is complex. Here's what we can gather:

*   A new patent generally has a term of 20 years from its filing date.
*   Patent term extensions (PTE) are possible to compensate for regulatory delays during FDA approval. The PTE is capped at 5 years, and the remaining patent life after PTE may not extend beyond 14 years after the drug's approval.
*   The Hatch-Waxman Act can provide up to 5 years of market exclusivity to companies introducing a new chemical entity (NCE) and up to 3 years market exclusivity for conducting trials via a new NDA, sNDA or 505(b)(2) application, supporting changes to marketed products.
*   Several factors can influence the actual generic entry date, including regulatory exclusivity.

Given that Ibrutinib received FDA approval on July 28, 2014, and patents typically last for 20 years from their filing date, the patent expiration date would be in 2034, but this could be altered by the factors mentioned above.

**3. Pharmaceutical Company and Stock Information**

Crizotinib is marketed under the brand name Xalkori. It was originally developed and marketed by Pfizer.

*   **Pharmaceutical Company:** Pfizer ([6], [7], [10], [19])

**4. Pfizer Stock Market Listing**

*   Pfizer is listed on the NYSE
    *   **Ticker Symbol:** PFE ([6], [10])

**5. Opening Stock Price on the FDA Approval Date**

As no new FDA approvals were identified between Jan 1 2024-Dec 31 2024, I can't provide stock market data for that time frame, since crizotinib was already an approved drug.

**1. More Effective Regimen Ingredients and Identification of ""L"" Ingredient:**

*   Clinical trial NCT01938001, known as the AUGMENT trial, studied the combination of rituximab and lenalidomide (R²) compared to rituximab alone in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The results indicated that R² (rituximab + lenalidomide) was more effective.
*   Therefore, the more effective regimen includes **rituximab** and **lenalidomide**. The ingredient that starts with the letter ""L"" is **lenalidomide**.

**2. FDA Approval for Lenalidomide:**

*   Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug.
*   In the US, lenalidomide was approved as a second-line therapy for follicular lymphoma in 2019, based on the AUGMENT trial results.

**3. Pharmaceutical Company and FDA Approval Date:**

*   I'm looking for the pharmaceutical company that received the *most recent* FDA approval specifically for lenalidomide (not new indications or supplemental approvals) *up to December 2024.* Unfortunately, my search results do not give one specific, clearcut answer regarding the *original* FDA approval date and the company that first obtained it. It is known that Celgene originally developed and marketed lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). However, Celgene was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in 2019.
* It is more likely that the most recent FDA approval for lenalidomide until December 2024 would belong to Bristol-Myers Squibb, due to their acquisition of Celgene.

**4. Stock Market Information (if applicable):**

*   Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
*   The stock ticker symbol is **BMY**.
*   Since Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Celgene, it is difficult to define the exact FDA approval date of lenalidomide by Celgene. As such, I am unable to provide the opening stock price of BMY on the FDA approval date.

The ""Ven"" arm showed improved progression-free survival (PFS), especially in patients with t(11;14) or BCL2high gene expression. The ingredient starting with the letter ""V"" is **Venetoclax**.

**2. Determine the pharmaceutical company with the most recent FDA approval for Venetoclax (up to December 2024):**

Venetoclax is co-marketed by AbbVie and Genentech (Roche). I was able to find that The FDA approved Brintellix (vortioxetine), which contains the active ingredient vortioxetine hydrobromide to treat adults with major depressive disorder, on September 3, 2013. Brintellix is comarketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Lundbeck. Lundbeck received FDA approval for **Vortioxetine** on September 3, 2013. Therefore, **Lundbeck** is the pharmaceutical company with the most recent overall FDA approval for vortioxetine (up to December 2024).

**3. Determine if Lundbeck is listed on a US stock market and provide the ticker symbol and opening price on the approval date:**

Lundbeck is primarily listed on the Nasdaq Copenhagen exchange. However, H. Lundbeck A/S A stocks are traded under the ticker HLUN_A.
