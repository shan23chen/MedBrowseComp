Based on the information available, determining a specific exclusivity date for Crizotinib that falls before December 2024 is challenging. Here's why:

*   **Exclusivity vs. Patents:** It's important to distinguish between drug patents and regulatory exclusivities. Both can prevent generic versions from entering the market, but they operate differently. Patents are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and typically last for 20 years from the filing date. Exclusivities are granted by the FDA upon drug approval and can range from 6 months to 7 years, depending on the circumstances.
*   **Crizotinib Approval Date:** Crizotinib was approved by the FDA in 2011.
*   **Exclusivity Information:** The exclusivity for Crizotinib likely expired well before December 2024, given the typical exclusivity periods. Patents for some drugs containing crizotinib may be applicable to consider.
*   **Generic Availability:** Crizotinib is now available as a generic, meaning any exclusivities have expired.

*   Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THD ascorbate)

From this list, the ingredient that starts with the letter ""L"" is **Lutikizumab.** However, Lutikizumab is not one of the ingredients in the anti-aging cream used in clinical trial NCT01718379. It is a targeted therapy being investigated in a separate clinical trial for Crohn's Disease [7]. There appear to be no ingredients with the letter ""L"" used in the referenced trial.

Regarding exclusivity, it's important to understand how exclusivity works for ingredients in listed medicines. In Australia, a successful applicant for a *new* permitted ingredient may have exclusive use of that ingredient for a 2-year period [1, 3].

If Lutikizumab were a new ingredient approved for use in listed medicines in Australia, and it was last approved before December 2024, its exclusivity date would be determined by adding 2 years to its approval date.

The search results indicate that as of January 8, 2025, Lactogen 1 (with L. reuteri) had been approved [4]. And according to one source L-alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine was approved as of March 13, 2024 in China [5].

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/1023 of 8 April 2024 amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 as regards the conditions of use of the novel food lactitol [12].

Therefore, considering that there are multiple possible ""L"" ingredient, the following exclusivity dates are possible.
*Assuming Lactogen 1 (with L. reuteri) was last approved on 01-08-2025: 01-08-2027

**1. Identifying the Ingredient:**

While I don't have direct access to the full details of clinical trial NCT00012051, ""Doxorubicin"" appears to be a likely candidate for an effective regime ingredient starting with the letter ""D"".

**2. Exclusivity Date:**

Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding Doxorubicin and exclusivity:

*   **Doxil Exclusivity Extension:** An orphan designation for Doxil (a liposomal form of doxorubicin) in combination with bortezomib for multiple myeloma resulted in an exclusivity extension to **May 17, 2014**
*   **Generic Doxil Approval:** In February 2013, the FDA approved a generic version of Doxil, but the exclusivity agreement for multiple myeloma treatment remained in place until May 17, 2014.
*   **AVA6000 Orphan Drug Designation:** In September 2022, AVA6000 (a pro-drug of doxorubicin) received orphan drug designation for soft tissue sarcoma, potentially granting 7 years of market exclusivity if approved.
*   **Doxorubicin-Containing Microneedle Array (D-MNA) Patch:** In December 2024, Medicus Pharma Ltd. announced that its Doxorubicin-containing microneedle array (D-MNA) patch received Minor Use in Major Species Designation (MUMS) from the FDA for treating external squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in horses, entitling the company to an extended 7-year period of exclusive marketing following approval or conditional approval.

Therefore, if we consider the last exclusivity approval date up till December 2024, that would be related to Medicus Pharma Ltd.'s Doxorubicin-containing microneedle array (D-MNA) patch. And if the D-MNA patch receives final approval, that would mean 7 years of market exclusivity following that potential approval date. Since the final approval date is still not available as of now, the exclusivity date is also unavailable.

The ingredient starting with the letter ""I"" is **Ibrutinib**. Ibrutinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in February 2013.

Determining the exact exclusivity date for ibrutinib is complex. Here's why:

*   **Multiple Exclusivities**: Pharmaceutical products can have different types of exclusivity (e.g., New Chemical Entity exclusivity, Orphan Drug exclusivity, Pediatric exclusivity) that may run concurrently or consecutively. Each type provides a different period of market protection.
*   **Patent Extensions**: Patent Term Extensions (PTEs) can extend a drug's patent life, but the maximum extension is limited.
*   **Data vs. Market Exclusivity**: Data exclusivity protects clinical trial data, while market exclusivity prevents the approval of generic versions.

Given that ibrutinib was approved in February 2013, any New Chemical Entity (NCE) exclusivity (typically 5 years) would have expired in February 2018. It is difficult to provide an exact exclusivity date without knowing all applicable patents, extensions, and exclusivities granted for Ibrutinib.
