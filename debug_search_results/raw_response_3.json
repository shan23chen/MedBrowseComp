    "text": "The clinical trial NCT02294461 evaluated the efficacy and safety of Enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Enzalutamide was compared to a placebo, and the study found that Enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and improved other secondary efficacy endpoints. Therefore, the ingredient starting with the letter \"E\" that was part of an effective regimen in this trial is **Enzalutamide**.\n\nRegarding the FDA exclusivity for Enzalutamide (brand name Xtandi):\nThe ingredient in the clinical trial NCT02294461 that starts with the letter E is Enzalutamide.\n\nEnzalutamide, brand name Xtandi, was first approved by the FDA on August 31, 2012. According to DrugPatentWatch, Xtandi is protected by fifteen US patents and one FDA Regulatory Exclusivity. One article from April 2024 mentions that both Xtandi formulations have market exclusivity until November 2026 for their newest indication (nonmetastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer), which was approved about five months prior to the article's publication. Another source also indicates that Xtandi is due to lose patent protection in the US in 2027.\n\nBased on the available information, there isn't a single, specific \"overall FDA drug approval\" exclusivity date that is clearly defined and unexpired up to December 2024, separate from patent protections or exclusivity for new indications. The initial approval was in 2012, and subsequent approvals for new indications have occurred, with the latest noted exclusivity for a new indication extending to November 2026.\n\nGiven the complexity of drug patents and exclusivities, and the focus on *overall* FDA drug approval rather than new indications, it's difficult to pinpoint a single date that fits the user's specific criteria. However, considering the first approval was in 2012 and standard exclusivities, any initial overall drug approval exclusivity would likely have expired by December 2024. The more recent exclusivity information pertains to new indications or patent protections.\n\nTherefore, for the overall FDA drug approval exclusivity:\nDATE: NA",
