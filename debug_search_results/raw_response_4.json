    "text": "For clinical trial NCT02294461, the studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of **enzalutamide** for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Enzalutamide was compared against a placebo in these studies. Results indicated that enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and improved other secondary endpoints like overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival. The ingredient starting with the letter \"E\" in this regimen is **Enzalutamide**.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company that most recently received FDA approval for enzalutamide (brand name Xtandi) up until December 2024 is Astellas Pharma US, Inc. While specific dates of very recent approvals for Astellas were not found in the search results, historical information shows Astellas as a key company associated with Xtandi's development and marketing. It is important to note that the initial FDA approval for Elotuzumab (brand name Empliciti), an ingredient mentioned in other search results for a different condition (Multiple Myeloma), was for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and AbbVie in November 2015. However, the question specifically pertains to the ingredient identified from NCT02294461, which is enzalutamide.\n\nAstellas Pharma Inc. is the parent company of Astellas Pharma US, Inc. and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It is also traded on U.S. over-the-counter (OTC) markets.\n\nTherefore, for Astellas Pharma:\n1. The stock ticker symbol for the U.S. OTC market is **ALPMY**.\n2.  Determining the opening stock price on a specific FDA approval date for enzalutamide for Astellas Pharma requires identifying a specific overall FDA drug approval date for Astellas up to December 2024. The search results did not provide a singular, most recent *overall* FDA drug approval date for enzalutamide specifically for Astellas within the requested timeframe that would allow for a precise stock price lookup for that exact day. Enzalutamide has had various approvals for different indications and in different regions over time.\n\nIf we consider the initial FDA approval for Elotuzumab (Empliciti) on November 30, 2015, which involved Bristol-Myers Squibb:\n1. The stock ticker symbol for Bristol Myers Squibb is **BMY** (NYSE).\n2.  Historical stock data for BMY on November 30, 2015, would be needed to determine the opening price. One search result indicates an all-time high for BMY on November 30, 2022, not 2015. Other historical data sources would be required for the 2015 date.\n\nHowever, since the question focuses on the ingredient from NCT02294461 (Enzalutamide) and the associated company (Astellas Pharma for Xtandi), and a precise, most recent overall FDA approval date for Astellas up to December 2024 for this ingredient is not readily available in the provided search results, the opening stock price for that specific date cannot be definitively provided. The most recent overall FDA approval for enzalutamide was not identified in the provided search results.",
