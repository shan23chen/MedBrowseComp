    "text": "Based on the search results, specifically the study published in JAMA Oncology regarding adjuvant capecitabine following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, I am unable to identify a specific second author. The available snippets refer to findings from a clinical trial (NCT02143388) where patients were assigned to either capecitabine or observation after CRT. To provide the name of the second author, I would need access to the full publication details, which are not available in the current search results.\n",
