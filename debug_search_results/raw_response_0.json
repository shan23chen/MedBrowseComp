    "text": "Based on the search results, the most relevant study is a phase III clinical trial that evaluated the addition of hydralazine and valproate (HV) to cisplatin and topotecan (CT) in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Study Design:** Randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial.\n*   **Treatment Groups:**\n    *   Cisplatin + Topotecan + Hydralazine/Valproate (CT + HV)\n    *   Cisplatin + Topotecan + Placebo (CT + PLA)\n*   **Key Findings:** The study indicated a statistically significant advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) for the CT + HV group (10 months) compared to the CT + PLA group (6 months).\n\nTo find the second author of this study, I need to look at the publication details. Based on the search results, one relevant citation is:\n\n*   Coronel et al., \"A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial of chemotherapy plus epigenetic therapy with hydralazine valproate for advanced cervical cancer. Preliminary results,\" *Medical Oncology*, 2011;28(Suppl 1):S540\u2013S546.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the second author is unknown.\n",
