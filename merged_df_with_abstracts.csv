Envafolimab, a humanized single-domain anti-PD-L1 antibody fused to an Fc fragment, represents a potential advance because it can be conveniently administered subcutaneously.Methods:This open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of envafolimab in patients with previously treated advanced dMMR/MSI-H tumors from 25 clinical sites across China. Adults with histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic malignant dMMR/MSI-H solid tumors received weekly 150 mg subcutaneous envafolimab injections in a 28-day treatment cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate (assessed by a blinded independent review committee). Secondary efficacy outcomes were disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.Results:One hundred and three patients (65 with colorectal cancer, 18 with gastric cancer, and 20 with other solid tumors) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 11.5 months. The objective response rate was 42.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.0-52.8), and the disease control rate was 66.0% (95% CI 56.0-75.1). Median duration of response was not reached; the duration of response rate at 12 months was 92.2% (95% CI 77.5-97.4). Median progression-free survival was 11.1 months (95% CI 5.5 to not evaluable). Overall survival at 12 months was 74.6% (95% CI 64.7-82.1). Sixteen patients (16%) had at least one grade 3 or 4 related treatment-emergent adverse event. No grade 5 treatment-emergent adverse events related to envafolimab were reported. Injection site reactions, all grade 1-2, were reported in nine patients (9%), but there were no infusion reactions. Eight patients (8%) had grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events.Conclusions:This is the first pivotal phase 2 study to examine the efficacy and safety of a single-domain immune checkpoint antibody in the treatment of cancer. Envafolimab was effective and had acceptable safety in the treatment of previously treated advanced dMMR/MSI-H solid tumors. As the first single-domain PD-L1-targeting antibody administered by rapid subcutaneous injection, envafolimab has the potential to be a significant advance in the treatment of cancer.

To our knowledge, this phase II, single-arm, registration trial is the first prospective clinical trial in this disease, investigating the safety and efficacy of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitornab-sirolimus (AMPECT,NCT02494570).Patients and methods:Patients with malignant PEComa were treated withnab-sirolimus 100 mg/m2intravenously once weekly for 2 weeks in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was objective response rate evaluated by independent radiology review. Key secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. A key exploratory end point was tumor biomarker analysis.Results:Thirty-four patients were treated (safety evaluable), and 31 were evaluable for efficacy. The overall response rate was 39% (12 of 31; 95% CI, 22 to 58) with one complete and 11 partial responses, 52% (16 of 31) of patients had stable disease, and 10% (3 of 31) had progressive disease. Responses were of rapid onset (67% by week 6) and durable. Median duration of response was not reached after a median follow-up for response of 2.5 years, with 7 of 12 responders with treatment ongoing (range, 5.6-47.2+ months). Twenty-five of 31 patients had tumor mutation profiling: 8 of 9 (89%) patients with aTSC2mutation achieved a confirmed response versus 2 of 16 (13%) withoutTSC2mutation (P< .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months (95% CI, 5.5 months to not reached), and the median overall survival was 40.8 months (95% CI, 22.2 months to not reached). Most treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 and were manageable for long-term treatment. No grade ≥ 4 treatment-related events occurred.Conclusion:nab-Sirolimus is active in patients with malignant PEComa. The response rate, durability of response, disease control rate, and safety profile support thatnab-sirolimus represents an important new treatment option for this disease."

Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published inJCOor elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.nab-Sirolimus is approved in the United States for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) on the basis of the primary analysis results of the phase II Advanced Malignant Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Tumors (AMPECT) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT02494570). Results from the primary analysis were previously published; however, the median duration of response (mDOR) had not been reached at that time. Here, 3 years after the primary analysis, we report final efficacy and safety data (data cutoff: April 29, 2022). At study completion, the confirmed overall response rate (by independent radiologist review using RECIST v1.1) was 38.7% (95% CI, 21.8 to 57.8), with an additional converted confirmed complete response (n = 2). Median progression-free survival remained the same at 10.6 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 41.2). The mDOR was reached at 39.7 months (95% CI, 6.5 to not reached [NR]), and the median overall survival at completion was 53.1 months (95% CI, 22.2 to NR). The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were stomatitis (82.4%) and fatigue and rash (each 61.8%). No new or unexpected adverse events occurred, and no grade ≥4 TRAEs were reported. These results highlight the long-term clinical benefit ofnab-sirolimus in patients with advanced malignant PEComa, with a DOR of >3 years."

Masitinib inhibits KIT and LYN kinases that are involved in indolent systemic mastocytosis pathogenesis. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of masitinib versus placebo in severely symptomatic patients who were unresponsive to optimal symptomatic treatments.Methods:In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we enrolled adults (aged 18-75 years) with indolent or smouldering systemic mastocytosis, according to WHO classification or documented mastocytosis based on histological criteria, at 50 centres in 15 countries. We excluded patients with cutaneous or non-severe systemic mastocytosis after a protocol amendment. Patients were centrally randomised (1:1) to receive either oral masitinib (6 mg/kg per day over 24 weeks with possible extension) or matched placebo with minimisation according to severe symptoms. The primary endpoint was cumulative response (≥75% improvement from baseline within weeks 8-24) in at least one severe baseline symptom from the following: pruritus score of 9 or more, eight or more flushes per week, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression of 19 or more, or Fatigue Impact Scale of 75 or more. We assessed treatment effect using repeated measures methodology for rare diseases via the generalised estimating equation model in a modified intention-to-treat population, including all participants assigned to treatment minus those who withdrew due to a non-treatment-related cause. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT00814073.Findings:Between Feb 19, 2009, and July 15, 2015, 135 patients were randomly assigned to masitinib (n=71) or placebo (n=64). By 24 weeks, masitinib was associated with a cumulative response of 18·7% in the primary endpoint (122·6 responses of 656·5 possible responses [weighted generalised estimating equation]) compared with 7·4% for placebo (48·9 of 656·5; difference 11·3%; odds ratio 3·6; 95% CI 1·2-10·8; p=0·0076). Frequent severe adverse events (>4% difference from placebo) were diarrhoea (eight [11%] of 70 in the masitinib group vs one [2%] of 63 in the placebo group), rash (four [6%] vs none), and asthenia (four [6%] vs one [2%]). The most frequent serious adverse events were diarrhoea (three patients [4%] vs one [2%]) and urticaria (two [3%] vs none), and no life-threatening toxicities occurred. One patient in the placebo group died (unrelated to study treatment).Interpretation:These study findings indicate that masitinib is an effective and well tolerated agent for the treatment of severely symptomatic indolent or smouldering systemic mastocytosis.Funding:AB Science (Paris, France)."

Masitinib was evaluated in patients with advanced GIST after imatinib failure or intolerance.Patients and methods:Prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial. Patients with inoperable, advanced imatinib-resistant GIST were randomized (1 : 1) to receive masitinib (12 mg/kg/day) or sunitinib (50 mg/day 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off) until progression, intolerance, or refusal. Primary efficacy analysis was noncomparative, testing whether masitinib attained a median progression-free survival (PFS) (blind centrally reviewed RECIST) threshold of >3 months according to the lower bound of the 90% unilateral confidence interval (CI). Secondary analyses on overall survival (OS) and PFS were comparative with results presented according to a two-sided 95% CI.Results:Forty-four patients were randomized to receive masitinib (n = 23) or sunitinib (n = 21). Median follow-up was 14 months. Patients receiving masitinib experienced less toxicity than those receiving sunitinib, with significantly lower occurrence of severe adverse events (52% versus 91%, respectively, P = 0.008). Median PFS (central RECIST) for the noncomparative primary analysis in the masitinib treatment arm was 3.71 months (90% CI 3.65). Secondary analyses showed that median OS was significantly longer for patients receiving masitinib followed by post-progression addition of sunitinib when compared against patients treated directly with sunitinib in second-line [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.85, P = 0.016]. This improvement was sustainable as evidenced by 26-month follow-up OS data (HR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.96, P = 0.033); an additional 12.4 months survival advantage being reported for the masitinib treatment arm. Risk of progression while under treatment with masitinib was in the same range as for sunitinib (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-2.2, P = 0.833).Conclusions:Primary efficacy analysis ensured the masitinib treatment arm could satisfy a prespecified PFS threshold. Secondary efficacy analysis showed that masitinib followed by the standard of care generated a statistically significant survival benefit over standard of care. Encouraging median OS and safety data from this well-controlled and appropriately designed randomized trial indicate a positive benefit-risk ratio. Further development of masitinib in imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with advanced GIST is warranted."
