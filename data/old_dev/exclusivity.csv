Enzalutamide significantly improved clinical outcomes compared with placebo in patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the PREVAIL study. However, few patients from Asia were enrolled. Our study (NCT02294461) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide in this disease setting in patients in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In this double-blind, phase III study, patients with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and disease progression despite ADT were randomized to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, time to first skeletal-related event (SRE), time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, PSA response ≥ 50%, best overall soft-tissue response, and safety. Pre-planned interim analysis was scheduled following approximately 175 PSA-progression events (67% of targeted total of 261 events). An additional 5-year landmark analysis of overall survival, time to antineoplastic therapy, and safety was performed. The double-blind study period was stopped after interim analysis owing to the benefit of enzalutamide over placebo. Overall, 388 patients were randomized (enzalutamide, n = 198; placebo, n = 190). Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of PSA progression vs placebo (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.27-0.52; P < 0.0001). Median time to PSA progression was 8.31 months with enzalutamide and 2.86 months with placebo. Secondary endpoints, including 5-year overall survival, were significantly improved with enzalutamide, except time to first SRE. Adverse-event incidence was similar between enzalutamide and placebo. Fatigue was the most common drug-related adverse event in both treatment groups. Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of PSA progression, improved secondary efficacy endpoints, and was well tolerated in chemotherapy-naïve Asian patients with mCRPC with disease progression despite ADT. www. gov NCT02294461.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35397772/,35397772,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy compared to Placebo when used to treat Prostate cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT02294461,"{""35397772"": ""Yeong-Shiau Pu|Hanjong Ahn|Weiqing Han|Shu-Pin Huang|Hsi-Chin Wu|Lulin Ma|Shunsuke Yamada|Kazutaka Suga|Li-Ping Xie""}",2014-04-23,Yes,Yes,Oral,Chemotherapy,['ENZALUTAMIDE'],"['Enzalutamide', 'Placebo']",True,"ENZALUTAMIDE, 1, 0",more

Enzalutamide (formerly called MDV3100) targets multiple steps in the androgen-receptor-signaling pathway, the major driver of prostate-cancer growth. We aimed to evaluate whether enzalutamide prolongs survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy. In our phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we stratified 1199 men with castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score and pain intensity. We randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive oral enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg per day (800 patients) or placebo (399 patients). The primary end point was overall survival. The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths. The median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3 to not yet reached) in the enzalutamide group versus 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death in the enzalutamide group, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.75; P<0.001). The superiority of enzalutamide over placebo was shown with respect to all secondary end points: the proportion of patients with a reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level by 50% or more (54% vs. 2%, P<0.001), the soft-tissue response rate (29% vs. 4%, P<0.001), the quality-of-life response rate (43% vs. 18%, P<0.001), the time to PSA progression (8.3 vs. 3.0 months; hazard ratio, 0.25; P<0.001), radiographic progression-free survival (8.3 vs. 2.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001), and the time to the first skeletal-related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; P<0.001).

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK-positive) disease occurs in approximately 5% of all patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, with a similar incidence reported in Asian patients. This study is the first phase 3 randomised trial recruiting only Asian patients to compare alectinib with crizotinib as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with 600 mg of alectinib twice per day. This study assessed consistency of the progression-free survival benefit with the global phase 3 ALEX study. In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 21 investigational sites in China, South Korea, and Thailand, Asian patients, aged 18 years or older, with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) to twice-daily oral alectinib (600 mg) or crizotinib (250 mg). Patients were randomly assigned via a block-stratified (block size three) randomisation procedure, done centrally via an interactive voice or web response system, with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and baseline CNS metastases. Clinical staff and the funder's drug safety and medical monitoring staff had access to treatment assignments. The independent review committee was masked to treatment assignment, and funder personnel did not have access to efficacy and safety summaries by treatment group, before the formal reporting of study results. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were permitted. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients. The primary analysis population for safety was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02838420. Between Aug 3, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 187 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 125 to alectinib and 62 to crizotinib. Median follow-up was 16·2 months (IQR 13·7-17·6) in the alectinib group, and 15·0 months (12·5-17·3) in the crizotinib group. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with alectinib versus crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95% CI 0·13-0·38; p<0·0001; median progression-free survival not estimable vs 11·1 months). Independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the alectinib group compared with the crizotinib group (HR 0·37, 0·22-0·61; p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 114 (91%) of 125 with alectinib, and 48 (77%) of 62 with crizotinib, with a longer duration of response for alectinib than crizotinib (HR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12-0·40; p<0·0001). Time to CNS progression (cause-specific HR 0·14) and the percentage of patients who achieved a CNS objective response with measurable or non-measurable baseline CNS lesions were improved (32 [73%] of 44 patients treated with alectinib vs five [22%] of 23 patients treated with crizotinib). Despite longer treatment duration with alectinib than crizotinib (14·7 months vs 12·6 months, respectively), fewer patients had grade 3-5 adverse events (36 [29%] of 125 vs 30 [48%] of 62, respectively) or serious adverse events (19 [15%] of 125 vs 16 [26%] of 62, respectively).

Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically respond well to first-line immunochemotherapy. At relapse, single-agent rituximab is commonly administered. Data suggest the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide could increase the activity of rituximab. A phase III, multicenter, randomized trial of lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab was conducted in patients with relapsed and/or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma.

We sought to determine whether the addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AAP) to enzalutamide prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the first-line setting. Men with untreated mCRPC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive first-line enzalutamide with or without AAP. The primary end point was OS.

We studied the efficacy of continuing or reintroducing bevacizumab in combination with second-line chemotherapy after progression to bevacizumab-based first-line therapy. In this phase III study, patients with mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were randomized to receive in second-line mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI (depending on first-line regimen) with or without bevacizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. To detect a hazard ratio (HR) for progression of 0.70 with an α and β error of 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, 262 patients were required. In consideration of the results of the ML18147 trial, the study was prematurely stopped. Between April 2008 and May 2012, a total of 185 patients were randomized.

Venetoclax plus bortezomib and dexamethasone has shown encouraging clinical efficacy with acceptable safety and tolerability in a phase 1 trial. The aim of this study was to evaluate venetoclax plus bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial, patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, who had received one to three previous therapies were enrolled from 90 hospitals in 16 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) centrally using an interactive response technology system and a block size of three to receive venetoclax (800 mg per day orally) or placebo with bortezomib (1·3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously or intravenously and dexamethasone (20 mg orally). Treatment was given in 21-day cycles for the first eight cycles and 35-day cycles from the ninth cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Randomisation was stratified by previous exposure to a proteasome inhibitor and the number of previous therapies. Sponsors, investigators, study site personnel, and patients were masked to the treatment allocation throughout the study. The primary endpoint was independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02755597. Between July 19, 2016, and Oct 31, 2017, 291 patients were randomly assigned to receive venetoclax (n=194) or placebo (n=97). With a median follow-up of 18·7 months (IQR 16·6-21·0), median progression-free survival according to independent review committee was 22·4 months (95% CI 15·3-not estimable) with venetoclax versus 11·5 months (9·6-15·0) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·63 [95% CI 0·44-0·90]; p=0·010). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (35 [18%] of 193 patients in the venetoclax group vs seven [7%] of 96 patients in the placebo group), pneumonia (30 [16%] vs nine [9%]), thrombocytopenia (28 [15%] vs 29 [30%]), anaemia (28 [15%] vs 14 [15%]), and diarrhoea (28 [15%] vs 11 [11%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 93 (48%) patients in the venetoclax group and 48 (50%) patients in the placebo group, with eight (4%) treatment-emergent fatal infections reported in the venetoclax group and none reported in the placebo group. Three deaths in the venetoclax group (two from pneumonia and one from septic shock) were considered treatment-related; no deaths in the placebo group were treatment-related.

Crossover to lenalidomide was permitted for IC-treated patients with radiologically confirmed progressive disease. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and subtype analysis [GCB vs. activated B-cell (ABC)] using gene expression profiling (GEP) were exploratory endpoints.<b>Results:</b> Stage 1: 102 DLBCL patients (by IHC: non-GCB, <i>n</i> = 54; GCB, <i>n</i> = 48) received ≥1 dose of lenalidomide or IC.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients with metastatic or recurrent CRC that had progressed or recurred during or after adjuvant or first-line fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil/leucovorin or capecitabine, the latter only for metastatic CRC). Patients received IROX (irinotecan 200 mg/m(2) plus oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or irinotecan alone (350 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks.

Acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after non-myeloablative human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding sirolimus to the standard cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil prophylaxis therapy for preventing acute GVHD in this setting. This multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial took place at nine HSCT centres based in the USA, Denmark, and Germany. Eligible patients were diagnosed with advanced haematological malignancies treatable by allogeneic HSCT, had a Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 60, were aged older than 50 years, or if they were aged 50 years or younger, were considered at high risk of regimen-related toxicity associated with a high-dose pre-transplantation conditioning regimen. Patients were randomly allocated by an adaptive randomisation scheme stratified by transplantation centre to receive either the standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen (cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil) or the triple-drug combination regimen (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus). Patients and physicians were not masked to treatment. All patients were prepared for HSCT with fludarabine (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day) 4, 3, and 2 days before receiving 2 or 3 Gy total body irradiation on the day of HSCT (day 0). In both study groups, 5·0 mg/kg of cyclosporine was administered orally twice daily starting 3 days before HSCT, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered from day 96 through to day 150. In the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, 15 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil was given orally three times daily from day 0 until day 30, then twice daily until day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. In the triple-drug group, mycophenolate mofetil doses were the same as in the standard group, but the drug was discontinued on day 40. Sirolimus was started 3 days before HSCT, taken orally at 2 mg once daily and adjusted to maintain trough concentrations between 3-12 ng/mL through to day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD at day 100 post-transplantation. Secondary endpoints were non-relapse mortality, overall survival, progression-free survival, cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD, and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Efficacy and safety analyses were per protocol, including all patients who received conditioning treatment and underwent transplantation. Toxic effects were measured according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The current study was closed prematurely by recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board on July 27, 2016, after 168 patients received the allocated intervention, based on the results of a prespecified interim analysis for futility. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01231412. Participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2010, and July 27, 2016. Of 180 patients enrolled in the study, 167 received the complete study intervention and were included in safety and efficacy analyses: 77 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group and 90 in the triple-drug group.

The combined use of genetic markers and detectable minimal residual disease identifies patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with poor outcome after first-line chemoimmunotherapy. We aimed to assess lenalidomide maintenance therapy in these high-risk patients. In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study (CLLM1; CLL Maintenance 1 of the German CLL Study Group), patients older than 18 years and diagnosed with immunophenotypically confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with active disease, who responded to chemoimmunotherapy 2-5 months after completion of first-line therapy and who were assessed as having a high risk for an early progression with at least a partial response after four or more cycles of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, were eligible if they had high minimal residual disease levels or intermediate levels combined with an unmutated IGHV gene status or TP53 alterations. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either lenalidomide (5 mg) or placebo. Randomisation was done with a fixed block size of three, and was stratified according to the minimal residual disease level achieved after first-line therapy. Maintenance was started with 5 mg daily, and was escalated to the target dose of 15 mg. If tolerated, medication was administered until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival according to an independent review. The pre-planned interim analysis done by intention to treat was done after 20% of the calculated progression-free survival events. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01556776; treatment in the lenalidomide group is still ongoing. Between July 5, 2012, and March 15, 2016, 468 previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were screened for the study; 379 (81%) were not eligible. Recruitment was closed prematurely due to poor accrual after 89 of 200 planned patients were randomly assigned: 60 (67%) enrolled patients were assigned to the lenalidomide group and 29 (33%) to the placebo group, of whom 56 (63%) received lenalidomide and 29 (33%) placebo, with a median of 11·0 (IQR 4·5-20·5) treatment cycles at data cutoff. After a median observation time of 17·9 months (IQR 9·1-28·1), the hazard ratio for progression-free survival assessed by an independent review was 0·168 (95% CI 0·074-0·379). Median progression-free survival was 13·3 months (95% CI 9·9-19·7) in the placebo group and not reached (95% CI 32·3-not evaluable) in the lenalidomide group. The most frequent adverse events were skin disorders (35 patients [63%] in the lenalidomide group vs eight patients [28%] in the placebo group), gastrointestinal disorders (34 [61%] vs eight [28%]), infections (30 [54%] vs 19 [66%]), haematological toxicity (28 [50%] vs five [17%]), and general disorders (28 [50%] vs nine [31%]). One fatal adverse event was reported in each of the treatment groups (one [2%] patient with fatal acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the lenalidomide group and one patient (3%) with fatal multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the placebo group). Lenalidomide is an efficacious maintenance therapy reducing the relative risk of progression in first-line patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who do not achieve minimal residual disease negative disease state following chemoimmunotherapy approaches. The toxicity seems to be acceptable considering the poor prognosis of the eligible patients. The trial independently confirms the clinical significance of a novel, minimal residual disease-based algorithm to predict short progression-free survival, which might be incorporated in future clinical trials to identify candidates for additional maintenance treatment.

Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and high-risk features have poorer outcomes on ibrutinib than those without high-risk features. The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of adding ublituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to ibrutinib therapy in this population. We did a randomised, phase 3, multicentre study (GENUINE) of patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with at least one of 17p deletion, 11q deletion, or TP53 mutation, at 119 clinics in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients had received at least one previous chronic lymphocytic leukaemia therapy and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or lower. We randomised patients (1:1) using permuted block randomisation with a block size of four and stratified by previous lines of therapy (one vs two or more) to receive ibrutinib alone or ibrutinib in combination with ublituximab. Treatment allocation was not masked to patients or investigators. Ibrutinib was given orally daily at 420 mg for all cycles. Ublituximab was given intravenously in 28-day cycles, with increasing doses during cycle 1 (≤150 mg on day 1, 750 mg on day 2, and 900 mg on days 8 and 15) and continuing at 900 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6. After cycle 6, ublituximab was given at 900 mg every three cycles. The study was initially designed with co-primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall response rate but due to protracted patient accrual, the protocol was amended to have a single primary endpoint of independent review committee-assessed overall response rate (defined as the proportion of patients who had a partial response, complete response, or complete response with incomplete marrow recovery according to the 2008 International Workshop on CLL criteria) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was evaluated in the population of patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02301156, and the final analysis is presented. 224 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 126 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ublituximab plus ibrutinib (n=64) or ibrutinib alone (n=62) between Feb 6, 2015, and Dec 19, 2016. After a median follow-up of 41·6 months (IQR 36·7-47·3), the overall response rate was 53 (83%) of 64 patients in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and 40 (65%) of 62 patients in the ibrutinib group (p=0·020). 117 patients, including 59 in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and 58 in the ibrutinib group, received at least one dose of treatment and were included in safety analyses. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (11 [19%] patients in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and seven [12%] in the ibrutinib group), anaemia (five [8%] and five [9%]), and diarrhoea (six [10%] and three [5%]). The most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (six [10%] in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and four [7%] in the ibrutinib group), atrial fibrillation (four [7%] and one [2%]), sepsis (four [7%] and one [2%]), and febrile neutropenia (three [5%] and one [2%]). Two patients in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group died due to adverse events (one cardiac arrest and one failure to thrive), neither of which were treatment-related. Five patients in the ibrutinib group died due to adverse events, including one cardiac arrest, one cerebral infarction, one intracranial haemorrhage, one Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia infection, and one unexplained death; the death due to cardiac arrest was considered to be treatment-related. The addition of ublituximab to ibrutinib resulted in a statistically higher overall response rate without affecting the safety profile of ibrutinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation is a standard treatment for young patients with multiple myeloma. Residual disease is almost always present after transplantation and is responsible for relapse. This phase 3, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy of lenalidomide maintenance therapy after transplantation. We randomly assigned 614 patients younger than 65 years of age who had nonprogressive disease after first-line transplantation to maintenance treatment with either lenalidomide (10 mg per day for the first 3 months, increased to 15 mg if tolerated) or placebo until relapse. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Lenalidomide maintenance therapy improved median progression-free survival (41 months, vs. 23 months with placebo; hazard ratio, 0.50; P<0.001). This benefit was observed across all patient subgroups, including those based on the β(2)-microglobulin level, cytogenetic profile, and response after transplantation. With a median follow-up period of 45 months, more than 70% of patients in both groups were alive at 4 years. The rates of grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy were similar in the two groups. The incidence of second primary cancers was 3.1 per 100 patient-years in the lenalidomide group versus 1.2 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (P=0.002). Median event-free survival (with events that included second primary cancers) was significantly improved with lenalidomide (40 months, vs. 23 months with placebo; P<0.001).

Although androgen deprivation therapy is typically given long-term for men with metastatic prostate cancer, second-generation hormone therapies are generally discontinued before the subsequent line of treatment. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of continuing enzalutamide after progression in controlling metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with docetaxel and prednisolone. PRESIDE was a two-period, multinational, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b study done at 123 sites in Europe (in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK). Patients were eligible for period 1 (P1) of the study if they had histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma without neuroendocrine differentiation or small-cell features, serum testosterone concentrations of 1·73 nmol/L or less, and had progressed during androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist or after bilateral orchiectomy. In P1, patients received open-label enzalutamide 160 mg per day orally. At week 13, patients were assessed for either radiographic or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (25% or more increase and 2 ng/mL or more above nadir). Patients who showed any decline in PSA at week 13 and subsequently progressed (radiographic progression, PSA progression, or both) were screened and enrolled in period 2 (P2), during which eligible patients were treated with up to ten cycles of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks and oral prednisolone 10 mg/day, and randomly assigned (1:1) to oral enzalutamide 160 mg/day or oral placebo. Patients were stratified by type of disease progression. The block size was four and the overall number of blocks was 400. Patients, investigators, and study organisers were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival analysed in all patients in P2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02288247, and is no longer recruiting. Between Dec 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2016, 816 patients were screened for P1 of the study. 688 patients were enrolled in P1 and 687 received open-label enzalutamide. In P2, 271 patients were randomly assigned at 73 sites to receive enzalutamide (n=136) or placebo (n=135). The data cutoff for analysis was April 30, 2020. Median progression-free survival with enzalutamide was 9·5 months (95% CI 8·3-10·9) versus 8·3 months (6·3-8·7) with placebo (hazard ratio 0·72 [95% CI 0·53-0·96]; p=0·027). The most common grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (17 [13%] of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 12 [9%] of 135 patients in the placebo group) and asthenia (ten [7%] vs six [4%]). The most common grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse event in P2 was neutropenia (23 [17%] of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 28 [21%] of 135 patients in the placebo group). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 67 (49%) of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group and 52 (39%) of 135 patients in the placebo group.

The phase III randomized PROFILE 1014 study demonstrated superiority of crizotinib to first-line chemotherapy in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated patients with ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-positive advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. This result was consistent with that in the smaller subset of East Asian patients in PROFILE 1014. The subsequent study reported here prospectively evaluated crizotinib in a larger East Asian patient population. In this open-label phase III study (PROFILE 1029), patients were randomized 1:1 to receive orally administered crizotinib 250 mg twice daily continuously (3-week cycles) or intravenously administered chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, plus cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, or carboplatin [at a dose to produce area under the concentration-time curve of 5-6 mg·min/mL]) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. PFS confirmed by independent radiology review was the primary end point. Crizotinib significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio, 0.402; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.286-0.565; p < 0.001). The median PFS was 11.1 months with crizotinib and 6.8 months with chemotherapy.

Purpose The standard treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, has shown activity in DLBCL. This randomized phase III trial compared lenalidomide as maintenance therapy with placebo in elderly patients with DLBCL who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to R-CHOP induction. Methods Patients with previously untreated DLBCL or other aggressive B-cell lymphoma were 60 to 80 years old, had CR or PR after six or eight cycles of R-CHOP, and were randomly assigned to lenalidomide maintenance 25 mg/d or placebo for 21 days of every 28-day cycle for 24 months. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results A total of 650 patients were randomly assigned. At the time of the primary analysis (December 2015), with a median follow-up of 39 months from random assignment, median PFS was not reached for lenalidomide maintenance versus 58.9 months for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.708; 95% CI, 0.537 to 0.933; P = .01). The result was consistent among analyzed subgroups (eg, male v female, age-adjusted International Prognostic Index 0 or 1 v 2 or 3, age younger than 70 v ≥ 70 years), response (PR v CR) after R-CHOP, and positron emission tomography status at assignment (negative v positive).
