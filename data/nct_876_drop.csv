"Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Study of Tasquinimod in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. Tasquinimod, a novel oral therapy targeting the tumor microenvironment, significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This phase III study was conducted to confirm the phase II results and to detect an overall survival (OS) benefit. Men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC and evidence of bone metastases were assigned (2:1) to receive tasquinimod once per day or placebo until progression or toxicity. The primary end point was radiographic PFS (rPFS; time from random assignment to radiologic progression or death) per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria and RECIST 1.1. The study had 99.9% power to detect an rPFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6 with a two-sided alpha error of .05 and 80% power to detect a target HR of 0.8 for OS, the key secondary end point. In all, 1,245 patients were randomly assigned to either tasquinimod (n = 832) or placebo (n = 413) between March 2011 and December 2012 at 241 sites in 37 countries. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups: median age, 71 years; Karnofsky performance status ≥ 90%, 77.3%; and visceral metastases, 21.1%. Estimated median rPFS by central review was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.8 to 8.2 months) with tasquinimod and 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 5.5 months) with placebo (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.75; P < .001). Median OS was 21.3 months (95% CI, 19.5 to 23.0 months) with tasquinimod and 24.0 months (95% CI, 21.4 to 26.9 months) with placebo (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.28; P = .25). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were more frequent with tasquinimod (42.8% v 33.6%), the most common being anemia, fatigue, and cancer pain. In chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC, tasquinimod significantly improved rPFS compared with placebo.

"Open-label phase III trial of panitumumab plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care alone in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We compared the activity of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) to that of BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed after standard chemotherapy. We randomly assigned 463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, measurable disease, and radiologic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months of most recent chemotherapy to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus BSC (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Tumor assessments by blinded central review were scheduled from week 8 until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety. BSC patients who progressed could receive panitumumab in a cross-over study. Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Median PFS time was 8 weeks (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4) for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks (95% CI, 7.1 to 7.7) for BSC. Mean (standard error) PFS time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 (0.5) weeks for BSC. Objective response rates also favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), which was confounded by similar activity of panitumumab after 76% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study. Panitumumab was well tolerated. Skin toxicities, hypomagnesaemia, and diarrhea were the most common toxicities observed. No patients had grade 3/4 infusion reactions.

"Metronomic capecitabine as adjuvant therapy in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma have a high risk of disease relapse, despite a high proportion of patients attaining complete clinical remission after receiving standard-of-care treatment (ie, definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy). Additional adjuvant therapies are needed to further reduce the risk of recurrence and death. However, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma remains controversial, highlighting the need for more effective adjuvant treatment options. This multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 14 hospitals in China. Patients (aged 18-65 years) with histologically confirmed, high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage III-IVA, excluding T3-4N0 and T3N1 disease), no locoregional disease or distant metastasis after definitive chemoradiotherapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, sufficient haematological, renal, and hepatic function, and who had received their final radiotherapy dose 12-16 weeks before randomisation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral metronomic capecitabine (650 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area twice daily for 1 year; metronomic capecitabine group) or observation (standard therapy group). Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence (block size of four), stratified by trial centre and receipt of induction chemotherapy (yes or no). The primary endpoint was failure-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence (distant metastasis or locoregional recurrence) or death due to any cause, in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of capecitabine or who had commenced observation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02958111. Between Jan 25, 2017, and Oct 25, 2018, 675 patients were screened, of whom 406 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the metronomic capecitabine group (n=204) or to the standard therapy group (n=202). After a median follow-up of 38 months (IQR 33-42), there were 29 (14%) events of recurrence or death in the metronomic capecitabine group and 53 (26%) events of recurrence or death in the standard therapy group. Failure-free survival at 3 years was significantly higher in the metronomic capecitabine group (85·3% [95% CI 80·4-90·6]) than in the standard therapy group (75·7% [69·9-81·9]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0·50 (95% CI 0·32-0·79; p=0·0023). Grade 3 adverse events were reported in 35 (17%) of 201 patients in the metronomic capecitabine group and in 11 (6%) of 200 patients in the standard therapy group; hand-foot syndrome was the most common adverse event related to capecitabine (18 [9%] patients had grade 3 hand-foot syndrome). One (<1%) patient in the metronomic capecitabine group had grade 4 neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported in either group. The addition of metronomic adjuvant capecitabine to chemoradiotherapy significantly improved failure-free survival in patients with high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with a manageable safety profile. These results support a potential role for metronomic chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant cisplatin-gemcitabine versus cisplatin-fluorouracil chemotherapy for N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients with N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma have a high risk of treatment being unsuccessful despite the current practice of using a concurrent adjuvant cisplatin-fluorouracil regimen. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of concurrent adjuvant cisplatin-gemcitabine with cisplatin-fluorouracil in N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We conducted an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial at four cancer centres in China. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years with untreated, non-keratinising, stage T1-4 N2-3 M0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive concurrent cisplatin (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously) on days 1, 22, and 43 of intensity-modulated radiotherapy followed by either gemcitabine (1 g/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for 4 h on day 1) once every 3 weeks or fluorouracil (4 g/m<sup>2</sup> in continuous intravenous infusion for 96 h) and cisplatin (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for 4 h on day 1) once every 4 weeks, for three cycles. Randomisation was done using a computer-generated random number code with a block size of six, stratified by treatment centre and nodal category. The primary endpoint was 3-year progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all patients randomly assigned to treatment). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of chemoradiotherapy. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03321539, and patients are currently under follow-up. From Oct 30, 2017, to July 9, 2020, 240 patients (median age 44 years [IQR 36-52]; 175 [73%] male and 65 [27%] female) were randomly assigned to the cisplatin-fluorouracil group (n=120) or cisplatin-gemcitabine group (n=120). As of data cutoff (Dec 25, 2022), median follow-up was 40 months (IQR 32-48). 3-year progression-free survival was 83·9% (95% CI 75·9-89·4; 19 disease progressions and 11 deaths) in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group and 71·5% (62·5-78·7; 34 disease progressions and seven deaths) in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group (stratified hazard ratio 0·54 [95% CI 0·32-0·93]; log rank p=0·023). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events that occurred during treatment were leukopenia (61 [52%] of 117 in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group vs 34 [29%] of 116 in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group; p=0·00039), neutropenia (37 [32%] vs 19 [16%]; p=0·010), and mucositis (27 [23%] vs 32 [28%]; p=0·43). The most common grade 3 or worse late adverse event (occurring from 3 months after completion of radiotherapy) was auditory or hearing loss (six [5%] vs ten [9%]). One (1%) patient in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group died due to treatment-related complications (septic shock caused by neutropenic infection). No patients in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group had treatment-related deaths. Our findings suggest that concurrent adjuvant cisplatin-gemcitabine could be used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients with N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma, although long-term follow-up is required to confirm the optimal therapeutic ratio.

"Efficacy and safety of 3-month dosing regimen of degarelix in Japanese subjects with prostate cancer: A phase III study. Non-inferiority in the cumulative castration rate of the 3-month formulation of degarelix compared with the 3-month formulation of goserelin was evaluated in subjects with prostate cancer. A phase III, open-label, parallel-arm study was carried out. An initial dose of 240 mg degarelix or 3.6 mg goserelin was given s.c.; after day 28, a maintenance dose of 480 mg degarelix or 10.8 mg goserelin was given once every 84 days. Non-inferiority in castration rate and safety of degarelix to goserelin were evaluated. The primary end-point was the cumulative castration rate from day 28 to day 364 and the non-inferiority margin was set to be 10%. A total of 234 subjects with prostate cancer were randomized to the degarelix group (n = 117) and the goserelin group (n = 117). The cumulative castration rate was 95.1% in the degarelix group and 100.0% in the goserelin group. As there were no events in the goserelin group, an additional analysis was carried out using 95% confidence intervals of the difference in the proportion of subjects with castration. Analyses indicated the non-inferiority of the 3-month formulation of degarelix to goserelin. Degarelix showed more rapid decreases in testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and prostate-specific antigen levels compared with goserelin. The most common adverse events in the degarelix group were injection site reactions. Non-inferiority of the 3-month formulation of degarelix to goserelin was shown for testosterone suppression. The 3-month formulation of degarelix was also found to be tolerated as an androgen deprivation therapy for patients with prostate cancer.

"Enzalutamide in Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: An Asian Multiregional, Randomized Study. Enzalutamide significantly improved clinical outcomes compared with placebo in patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the PREVAIL study. However, few patients from Asia were enrolled. Our study (NCT02294461) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide in this disease setting in patients in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In this double-blind, phase III study, patients with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and disease progression despite ADT were randomized to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, time to first skeletal-related event (SRE), time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, PSA response ≥ 50%, best overall soft-tissue response, and safety. Pre-planned interim analysis was scheduled following approximately 175 PSA-progression events (67% of targeted total of 261 events). An additional 5-year landmark analysis of overall survival, time to antineoplastic therapy, and safety was performed. The double-blind study period was stopped after interim analysis owing to the benefit of enzalutamide over placebo. Overall, 388 patients were randomized (enzalutamide, n = 198; placebo, n = 190). Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of PSA progression vs placebo (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.27-0.52; P < 0.0001). Median time to PSA progression was 8.31 months with enzalutamide and 2.86 months with placebo. Secondary endpoints, including 5-year overall survival, were significantly improved with enzalutamide, except time to first SRE. Adverse-event incidence was similar between enzalutamide and placebo.

"Randomized, phase III trial of first-line figitumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Figitumumab (CP-751,871), a fully human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody, inhibits the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Our multicenter, randomized, phase III study compared figitumumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC disease with nonadenocarcinoma histology received open-label figitumumab (20 mg/kg) plus paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve, 6 mg · min/mL) or paclitaxel and carboplatin alone once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Of 681 randomly assigned patients, 671 received treatment. The study was closed early by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee because of futility and an increased incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-related deaths with figitumumab. Median OS was 8.6 months for figitumumab plus chemotherapy and 9.8 months for chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.40; P = .06); median progression-free survival was 4.7 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.4) and 4.6 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.4), respectively (HR, 1.10; P = .27); the objective response rates were 33% and 35%, respectively. The respective rates of all-causality SAEs were 66% and 51%; P < .01). Treatment-related grade 5 adverse events were also more common with figitumumab (5% v 1%; P < .01).

"Phase III trial of sunitinib in combination with capecitabine versus capecitabine monotherapy for the treatment of patients with pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable illness in the majority of cases, despite major therapeutic advances. This may be related to the ability of breast tumors to induce neoangiogenesis, even in the face of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Sunitinib, an inhibitor of key molecules involved in neoangiogenesis, has an established role in the treatment of metastatic renal cell and other cancers and demonstrated activity in a phase II trial in MBC. We performed a randomized phase III trial comparing sunitinib plus capecitabine (2,000 mg/m2) with single-agent capecitabine (2,500 mg/m2) in patients with heavily pretreated MBC. Eligibility criteria included MBC, prior therapy with anthracyclines and taxanes, one or two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease or early relapse after a taxane plus anthracycline adjuvant regimen, and adequate organ function and performance status. The primary end point was progression-free survival, for which the study had 90% power to detect a 50% improvement (from 4 to 6 months). A total of 442 patients were randomly assigned. Progression-free survival was not significantly different between the treatment arms, with medians of 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.5 to 6.0) for the sunitinib plus capecitabine arm and 5.9 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 7.6) for the capecitabine monotherapy arm (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.58; one-sided P = .941). There were no significant differences in response rate or overall survival. Toxicity, except for hand-foot syndrome, was more severe in the combination arm.

"Randomized phase II study of dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an irreversible pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, versus erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. This randomized, open-label trial compared dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an irreversible inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)/HER1, HER2, and HER4, with erlotinib, a reversible EGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, no prior HER-directed therapy, and one/two prior chemotherapy regimens received dacomitinib 45 mg or erlotinib 150 mg once daily. One hundred eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned. Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043).

"Masitinib in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after failure of imatinib: a randomized controlled open-label trial. Masitinib is a highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against the main oncogenic drivers of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Masitinib was evaluated in patients with advanced GIST after imatinib failure or intolerance. Prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial. Patients with inoperable, advanced imatinib-resistant GIST were randomized (1 : 1) to receive masitinib (12 mg/kg/day) or sunitinib (50 mg/day 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off) until progression, intolerance, or refusal. Primary efficacy analysis was noncomparative, testing whether masitinib attained a median progression-free survival (PFS) (blind centrally reviewed RECIST) threshold of >3 months according to the lower bound of the 90% unilateral confidence interval (CI). Secondary analyses on overall survival (OS) and PFS were comparative with results presented according to a two-sided 95% CI. Forty-four patients were randomized to receive masitinib (n = 23) or sunitinib (n = 21). Median follow-up was 14 months. Patients receiving masitinib experienced less toxicity than those receiving sunitinib, with significantly lower occurrence of severe adverse events (52% versus 91%, respectively, P = 0.008). Median PFS (central RECIST) for the noncomparative primary analysis in the masitinib treatment arm was 3.71 months (90% CI 3.65). Secondary analyses showed that median OS was significantly longer for patients receiving masitinib followed by post-progression addition of sunitinib when compared against patients treated directly with sunitinib in second-line [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.85, P = 0.016]. This improvement was sustainable as evidenced by 26-month follow-up OS data (HR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.96, P = 0.033); an additional 12.4 months survival advantage being reported for the masitinib treatment arm. Risk of progression while under treatment with masitinib was in the same range as for sunitinib (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-2.2, P = 0.833). Primary efficacy analysis ensured the masitinib treatment arm could satisfy a prespecified PFS threshold. Secondary efficacy analysis showed that masitinib followed by the standard of care generated a statistically significant survival benefit over standard of care.

"Cisplatin plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine for biliary tract cancer. There is no established standard chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer. We initially conducted a randomized, phase 2 study involving 86 patients to compare cisplatin plus gemcitabine with gemcitabine alone. After we found an improvement in progression-free survival, the trial was extended to the phase 3 trial reported here. We randomly assigned 410 patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, or ampullary cancer to receive either cisplatin (25 mg per square meter of body-surface area) followed by gemcitabine (1000 mg per square meter on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks for eight cycles) or gemcitabine alone (1000 mg per square meter on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks for six cycles) for up to 24 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. After a median follow-up of 8.2 months and 327 deaths, the median overall survival was 11.7 months among the 204 patients in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group and 8.1 months among the 206 patients in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.80; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival was 8.0 months in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group and 5.0 months in the gemcitabine-only group (P<0.001). In addition, the rate of tumor control among patients in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group was significantly increased (81.4% vs. 71.8%, P=0.049). Adverse events were similar in the two groups, with the exception of more neutropenia in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group; the number of neutropenia-associated infections was similar in the two groups. As compared with gemcitabine alone, cisplatin plus gemcitabine was associated with a significant survival advantage without the addition of substantial toxicity.

"Randomized adjuvant trial of tamoxifen and goserelin versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil: evidence for the superiority of treatment with endocrine blockade in premenopausal patients with hormone-responsive breast cancer--Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 5. Effective adjuvant treatment modalities in premenopausal breast cancer patients today include chemotherapy, ovariectomy, and tamoxifen administration. The purpose of Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 5 was to compare the efficacy of a combination endocrine treatment with standard chemotherapy. Assessable trial subjects (N = 1,034) presenting with hormone-responsive disease were randomized to receive either 3 years of goserelin plus 5 years of tamoxifen or six cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF). Stratification criteria included tumor stage and grade, number of involved nodes, type of surgery, and steroid hormone receptor content. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as time from randomization to first relapse, local recurrence, or contralateral incidence, and overall survival (OS) as time to date of death. With a 60-month median follow-up, 17.2% of patients in the endocrine group and 20.8% undergoing chemotherapy developed relapses. Local recurrences emerged in 4.7% and 8.0%, respectively. RFS and local recurrence-free survival differed significantly in favor of endocrine therapy (P =.037 and P =.015), with a similar trend observed in OS (P =.195).

"Extended adjuvant therapy with anastrozole among postmenopausal breast cancer patients: results from the randomized Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 6a. Clinical trial data have shown that among breast cancer patients who were disease free after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, further extended treatment with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole reduces breast cancer recurrence. We examined the efficacy and tolerability of extended adjuvant therapy with another aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, for 3 years among women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy. Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) Trial 6a is an extension of ABCSG Trial 6, in which hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal patients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, with or without the aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide, for the first 2 years of therapy. For ABCSG Trial 6a, patients who were disease free at the end of Trial 6 were randomly assigned to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment. Efficacy data were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with two-sided P values and Kaplan-Meier curves, and tolerability data were estimated using logistic regression analysis with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). ABCSG Trial 6a included 856 patients. At a median follow-up of 62.3 months, women who received anastrozole (n = 387) had a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis) compared with women who received no further treatment (n = 469; hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.96, P = .031). Anastrozole was well tolerated, and no unexpected adverse events were reported. These data confirm the benefit of extending adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years with anastrozole compared with no further treatment.

Adult chemotherapy-naïve patients with confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) grade 0-1, ongoing androgen deprivation (serum testosterone <50 ng/dL) with prostate specific antigen (PSA) or radiographic progression were randomized to receive abiraterone acetate (1000 mg, QD) + prednisone (5 mg, BID) or placebo + prednisone (5 mg, BID), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. Primary endpoint was improvements in time to PSA progression (TTPP).

"Perioperative chemotherapy compared with surgery alone for resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma: an FNCLCC and FFCD multicenter phase III trial. After curative resection, the prognosis of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is poor. This phase III trial was designed to evaluate the benefit in overall survival (OS) of perioperative fluorouracil plus cisplatin in resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Overall, 224 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or stomach were randomly assigned to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (CS group; n = 113) or surgery alone (S group; n = 111). Chemotherapy consisted of two or three preoperative cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 consecutive days (days 1 to 5) every 28 days and three or four postoperative cycles of the same regimen. The primary end point was OS. Compared with the S group, the CS group had a better OS (5-year rate 38% v 24%; hazard ratio [HR] for death: 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.95; P = .02); and a better disease-free survival (5-year rate: 34% v 19%; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89; P = .003). In the multivariable analysis, the favorable prognostic factors for survival were perioperative chemotherapy (P = .01) and stomach tumor localization (P < .01). Perioperative chemotherapy significantly improved the curative resection rate (84% v 73%; P = .04). Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 38% of CS patients (mainly neutropenia) but postoperative morbidity was similar in the two groups.

"Apalutamide plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus placebo plus abiraterone and prednisone in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (ACIS): a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 study. The majority of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) will have disease progression of a uniformly fatal disease. mCRPC is driven by both activated androgen receptors and elevated intratumoural androgens; however, the current standard of care is therapy that targets a single androgen signalling mechanism. We aimed to investigate the combination treatment using apalutamide plus abiraterone acetate, each of which suppresses the androgen signalling axis in a different way, versus standard care in mCRPC. ACIS was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study done at 167 hospitals in 17 countries in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Africa, and South America. We included chemotherapy-naive men (aged ≥18 years) with mCRPC who had not been previously treated with androgen biosynthesis signalling inhibitors and were receiving ongoing androgen deprivation therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and a Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form question 3 (ie, worst pain in the past 24 h) score of 3 or lower. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a centralised interactive web response system with a permuted block randomisation scheme (block size 4) to oral apalutamide 240 mg once daily plus oral abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily and oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily (apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone group) or placebo plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone (abiraterone-prednisone group), in 28-day treatment cycles. Randomisation was stratified by presence or absence of visceral metastases, ECOG performance status, and geographical region. Patients, the investigators, study team, and the sponsor were masked to group assignments. An independent data-monitoring committee continually monitored data to ensure ongoing patient safety, and reviewed efficacy data. The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was reported for all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is completed and no longer recruiting and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02257736. 982 men were enrolled and randomly assigned from Dec 10, 2014 to Aug 30, 2016 (492 to apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone; 490 to abiraterone-prednisone). At the primary analysis (median follow-up 25·7 months [IQR 23·0-28·9]), median radiographic progression-free survival was 22·6 months (95% CI 19·4-27·4) in the apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone group versus 16·6 months (13·9-19·3) in the abiraterone-prednisone group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·69, 95% CI 0·58-0·83; p<0·0001). At the updated analysis (final analysis for overall survival; median follow-up 54·8 months [IQR 51·5-58·4]), median radiographic progression-free survival was 24·0 months (95% CI 19·7-27·5) versus 16·6 months (13·9-19·3; HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·60-0·83; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event was hypertension (82 [17%] of 490 patients receiving apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone and 49 [10%] of 489 receiving abiraterone-prednisone). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 195 (40%) patients receiving apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone and 181 (37%) patients receiving abiraterone-prednisone. Drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events with fatal outcomes occurred in three (1%) patients in the apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone group (2 pulmonary embolism, 1 cardiac failure) and five (1%) patients in the abiraterone-prednisone group (1 cardiac failure and 1 cardiac arrest, 1 mesenteric arterial occlusion, 1 seizure, and 1 sudden death). Despite the use of an active and established therapy as the comparator, apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone improved radiographic progression-free survival. Additional studies to identify subgroups of patients who might benefit the most from combination therapy are needed to further refine the treatment of mCRPC.

"S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer: a randomized phase III study (ACTS-CC trial). S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine whose antitumor effects have been demonstrated in treating various gastrointestinal cancers, including metastatic colon cancer, when administered as monotherapy or in combination chemotherapy. We conducted a randomized phase III study investigating the efficacy of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer by evaluating its noninferiority to tegafur-uracil plus leucovorin (UFT/LV). Patients aged 20-80 years with curatively resected stage III colon cancer were randomly assigned to receive S-1 (80-120 mg/day on days 1-28 every 42 days; four courses) or UFT/LV (UFT: 300-600 mg/day and LV: 75 mg/day on days 1-28 every 35 days; five courses). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years. A total of 1518 patients (758 and 760 in the S-1 and UFT/LV group, respectively) were included in the full analysis set. The 3-year DFS rate was 75.5% and 72.5% in the S-1 and UFT/LV group, respectively. The stratified hazard ratio for DFS in the S-1 group compared with the UFT/LV group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-1.03), demonstrating the noninferiority of S-1 (noninferiority stratified log-rank test, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, no significant interactions were identified between the major baseline characteristics and the treatment groups. Adjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 for stage III colon cancer was confirmed to be noninferior in DFS compared with UFT/LV. S-1 could be a new treatment option as adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer.

"Efficacy and safety of the neonatal Fc receptor inhibitor efgartigimod in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ADVANCE IV): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Primary immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder mediated partly by platelet autoantibodies, resulting in thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and constitutional symptoms. Efgartigimod, a first-in-class novel human IgG1 Fc fragment, binds the neonatal Fc receptor with high affinity and thus reduces serum IgG concentrations, including autoantibodies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of efgartigimod in adults with persistent and chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia. This phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 24-week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous efgartigimod in adults aged 18 years or older with chronic or persistent primary immune thrombocytopenia who had an average platelet count of less than 30 000, had responded to at least one previous immune thrombocytopenia therapy, and were on a concurrent therapy at baseline or had received at least a second previous immune thrombocytopenia therapy. The study took place in 71 participating sites from Asia, Europe, and North America. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either efgartigimod (10 mg/kg) or placebo intravenously for the first 4 weeks, after which the dosing schedule could be altered to once per week or every other week depending on the patients' platelet count. The primary endpoint, evaluated in the chronic population, was sustained platelet count response (≥50 × 10<sup>9</sup> for at least 4 of the last 6 weeks). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04188379) and is completed. A total of 205 patients were screened from Dec 9, 2019, to Feb 3, 2022, and 131 (86 in the efgartigimod group; 45 in the placebo group) were randomly assigned. These patients represented a population with long-term disease who had a mean time since diagnosis of 10·6 years and 67% (88/131) of whom had received at least three previous immune thrombocytopenia treatments. 22% (17/78) of patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia receiving efgartigimod reached the primary endpoint compared with 5% (2/40) of those receiving placebo (p=0·032; adjusted difference in response, 16% [95% CI 2·6-26·4]). The median number of weeks of disease control in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia was 2·0 (IQR 0·0-11·0) for efgartigimod versus 0·0 (0·0-1·0) for placebo (p=0·0009). Efgartigimod was well tolerated; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events of interest in both groups were headache (16% in efgartigimod and 13% in placebo), haematuria (16% in efgartigimod and 16% in placebo), and petechiae (15% in efgartigimod and 27% in placebo). Efgartigimod significantly increased sustained platelet count responses compared with placebo in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia, including those who had received multiple previous immune thrombocytopenia therapies. Upon completion of the ADVANCE IV study, patients could enroll in the ongoing open-label extension.

"Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after knee replacement (ADVANCE-2): a randomised double-blind trial. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin are preferred for prevention of venous thromboembolism after major joint replacement. Apixaban, an orally active factor Xa inhibitor, might be as effective, have lower bleeding risk, and be easier to use than is enoxaparin. We assessed efficacy and safety of these drugs after elective total knee replacement. In ADVANCE-2, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind phase 3 study, patients undergoing elective unilateral or bilateral total knee replacement were randomly allocated through an interactive central telephone system to receive oral apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (n=1528) or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (1529). The randomisation schedule was generated by the Bristol-Myers Squibb randomisation centre and stratified by study site and by unilateral or bilateral surgery with a block size of four. Investigators, patients, statisticians, adjudicators, and steering committee were masked to allocation. Apixaban was started 12-24 h after wound closure and enoxaparin 12 h before surgery; both drugs were continued for 10-14 days, when bilateral ascending venography was scheduled. Primary outcome was the composite of asymptomatic and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and all-cause death during treatment. The statistical plan required non-inferiority of apixaban before testing for superiority; analysis was by intention to treat for non-inferiority testing. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00452530. 1973 of 3057 patients allocated to treatment (1528 apixaban, 1529 enoxaparin) were eligible for primary efficacy analysis. The primary outcome was reported in 147 (15%) of 976 apixaban patients and 243 (24%) of 997 enoxaparin patients (relative risk 0.62 [95% CI 0.51-0.74]; p<0.0001; absolute risk reduction 9.3% [5.8-12.7]). Major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 53 (4%) of 1501 patients receiving apixaban and 72 (5%) of 1508 treated with enoxaparin (p=0.09). Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, starting on the morning after total knee replacement, offers a convenient and more effective orally administered alternative to 40 mg per day enoxaparin, without increased bleeding.

"Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement. There are various regimens for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin predominantly inhibit factor Xa but also inhibit thrombin to some degree. Orally active, specific factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban may provide effective thromboprophylaxis with a lower risk of bleeding and improved ease of use. In this double-blind, double-dummy study, we randomly assigned 5407 patients undergoing total hip replacement to receive apixaban at a dose of 2.5 mg orally twice daily or enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours. Apixaban therapy was initiated 12 to 24 hours after closure of the surgical wound; enoxaparin therapy was initiated 12 hours before surgery. Prophylaxis was continued for 35 days after surgery, followed by bilateral venographic studies. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of asymptomatic or symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause during the treatment period. Patients were followed for an additional 60 days after the last intended dose of study medication. A total of 1949 patients in the apixaban group (72.0%) and 1917 patients in the enoxaparin group (71.0%) could be evaluated for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 27 patients in the apixaban group (1.4%) and in 74 patients in the enoxaparin group (3.9%) (relative risk with apixaban, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.54; P<0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority; absolute risk reduction, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). The composite outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 129 of 2673 patients assigned to apixaban (4.8%) and 134 of 2659 assigned to enoxaparin (5.0%) (absolute difference in risk, -0.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.4 to 1.0). Among patients undergoing hip replacement, thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, as compared with enoxaparin, was associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolism, without increased bleeding.

"Perioperative Durvalumab for Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant immunotherapy can improve outcomes in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Perioperative regimens may combine benefits of both to improve long-term outcomes. We randomly assigned patients with resectable NSCLC (stage II to IIIB [N2 node stage] according to the eighth edition of the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i>) to receive platinum-based chemotherapy plus durvalumab or placebo administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles before surgery, followed by adjuvant durvalumab or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for 12 cycles. Randomization was stratified according to disease stage (II or III) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (≥1% or <1%). Primary end points were event-free survival (defined as the time to the earliest occurrence of progressive disease that precluded surgery or prevented completion of surgery, disease recurrence [assessed in a blinded fashion by independent central review], or death from any cause) and pathological complete response (evaluated centrally). A total of 802 patients were randomly assigned to receive durvalumab (400 patients) or placebo (402 patients). The duration of event-free survival was significantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo; the stratified hazard ratio for disease progression, recurrence, or death was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.88; P = 0.004) at the first interim analysis. At the 12-month landmark analysis, event-free survival was observed in 73.4% of the patients who received durvalumab (95% CI, 67.9 to 78.1), as compared with 64.5% of the patients who received placebo (95% CI, 58.8 to 69.6). The incidence of pathological complete response was significantly greater with durvalumab than with placebo (17.2% vs. 4.3% at the final analysis; difference, 13.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.7 to 17.6; P<0.001 at interim analysis of data from 402 patients). Event-free survival and pathological complete response benefit were observed regardless of stage and PD-L1 expression. Adverse events of maximum grade 3 or 4 occurred in 42.4% of patients with durvalumab and in 43.2% with placebo. Data from 62 patients with documented <i>EGFR</i> or <i>ALK</i> alterations were excluded from the efficacy analyses in the modified intention-to-treat population. In patients with resectable NSCLC, perioperative durvalumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly greater event-free survival and pathological complete response than neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, with a safety profile that was consistent with the individual agents.

"Increased survival with enzalutamide in prostate cancer after chemotherapy. Enzalutamide (formerly called MDV3100) targets multiple steps in the androgen-receptor-signaling pathway, the major driver of prostate-cancer growth. We aimed to evaluate whether enzalutamide prolongs survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy. In our phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we stratified 1199 men with castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score and pain intensity. We randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive oral enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg per day (800 patients) or placebo (399 patients). The primary end point was overall survival. The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths. The median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3 to not yet reached) in the enzalutamide group versus 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death in the enzalutamide group, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.75; P<0.001). The superiority of enzalutamide over placebo was shown with respect to all secondary end points: the proportion of patients with a reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level by 50% or more (54% vs. 2%, P<0.001), the soft-tissue response rate (29% vs. 4%, P<0.001), the quality-of-life response rate (43% vs. 18%, P<0.001), the time to PSA progression (8.3 vs. 3.0 months; hazard ratio, 0.25; P<0.001), radiographic progression-free survival (8.3 vs. 2.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001), and the time to the first skeletal-related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; P<0.001). Rates of fatigue, diarrhea, and hot flashes were higher in the enzalutamide group. Seizures were reported in five patients (0.6%) receiving enzalutamide.

"Aflibercept plus FOLFIRI in Asian patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized Phase III study. To investigate whether the benefit of combining aflibercept with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy could be confirmed in patients from the Asia-Pacific region (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01661270). Patients & methods: Asian patients with oxaliplatin-pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer were randomized to receive aflibercept or placebo, followed by FOLFIRI. The primary end point was progression-free survival.

"Bcl-2 antisense (oblimersen sodium) plus dacarbazine in patients with advanced melanoma: the Oblimersen Melanoma Study Group. Chemotherapy resistance in melanoma has been linked to antiapoptotic effects mediated by Bcl-2 protein. We evaluated whether targeting Bcl-2 using an antisense oligonucleotide (oblimersen sodium) could improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma. We randomly assigned chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced melanoma to treatment with dacarbazine (1,000 mg/m2) alone or preceded by a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of oblimersen sodium (7 mg/kg/d) every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles. Patients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, liver metastases, disease site, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The primary efficacy end point was overall survival. Among 771 patients randomly assigned, the addition of oblimersen to dacarbazine yielded a trend toward improved survival at 24-month minimum follow-up (median, 9.0 v 7.8 months; P = .077) and significant increases in progression-free survival (median, 2.6 v 1.6 months; P < .001), overall response (13.5% v 7.5%; P = .007), complete response (2.8% v 0.8%), and durable response (7.3% v 3.6%; P = .03). A significant interaction between baseline serum LDH and treatment was observed; oblimersen significantly increased survival in patients whose baseline serum LDH was not elevated (median overall survival, 11.4 v 9.7 months; P = .02). Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were increased in the oblimersen-dacarbazine group; however, there was no increase in serious infections or bleeding events.

"Rituximab maintenance versus observation alone in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who respond to first-line or second-line rituximab-containing chemoimmunotherapy: final results of the AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance randomised trial. In many patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia requiring treatment, induction therapy with rituximab plus chemotherapy improves outcomes compared with chemotherapy alone. In this study we aimed to investigate the potential of rituximab maintenance therapy to prolong disease control in patients who respond to rituximab-containing induction regimens. In this randomised, international, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial, we enrolled patients who had achieved a complete response (CR), CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), or partial response (PR) to first-line or second-line rituximab-containing chemoimmunotherapy and randomly assigned them in a 1:1 ratio (central block randomisation in the electronic case report form system) to either intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m(2) every 3 months, or observation alone, for 2 years. Stratification was by country, line of treatment, type of chemotherapy added to the rituximab backbone, and degree of remission following induction. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. This is the final, event-triggered analysis. Final analysis was triggered by the occurrence of 92 events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01118234. Between April 1, 2010, and Dec 23, 2013, 134 patients were randomised to rituximab and 129 to observation alone. Median observation times were 33·4 months (IQR 25·7-42·8) for the rituximab group and 34·0 months (25·4-41·9) for the observation group. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the rituximab maintenance group (47·0 months, IQR 28·5-incalculable) than with observation alone (35·5 months, 95% CI 25·7-46·3; hazard ratio [HR] 0·50, 95% CI 0·33-0·75, p=0·00077). The incidence of grade 3-4 haematological toxicities other than neutropenia was similar in the two treatment groups. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 28 (21%) patients in the rituximab group and 14 (11%) patients in the observation group. Apart from neutropenia, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were upper (five vs one [1%] patient in the observation group) and lower (three [2%] vs one [1%]) respiratory tract infection, pneumonia (nine [7%] vs two [2%]), thrombopenia (four [3%] vs four [3%]), neoplasms (five [4%] vs four [3%]), and eye disorders (four [3%] vs two [2%]). The overall incidence of infections of all grades was higher among rituximab recipients (88 [66%] vs 65 [50%]). Rituximab maintenance therapy prolongs progression-free survival in patients achieving at least a PR to induction with rituximab plus chemotherapy, and the treatment is well tolerated overall. Although it is associated with an increase in infections, there is no excess in infection mortality, suggesting that remission maintenance with rituximab is an effective and safe option in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in early treatment phases.

"Bevacizumab and platinum-based combinations for recurrent ovarian cancer: a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. State-of-the art therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer suitable for platinum-based re-treatment includes bevacizumab-containing combinations (eg, bevacizumab combined with carboplatin-paclitaxel or carboplatin-gemcitabine) or the most active non-bevacizumab regimen: carboplatin-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The aim of this head-to-head trial was to compare a standard bevacizumab-containing regimen versus carboplatin-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combined with bevacizumab. This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, was done in 159 academic centres in Germany, France, Australia, Austria, and the UK. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) had histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma with first disease recurrence more than 6 months after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were stratified by platinum-free interval, residual tumour, previous antiangiogenic therapy, and study group language, and were centrally randomly assigned 1:1 using randomly permuted blocks of size two, four, or six to receive six intravenous cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, day 1) plus carboplatin (area under the concentration curve [AUC] 4, day 1) plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks or six cycles of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, days 1 and 15) plus carboplatin (AUC 5, day 1) plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 1) every 4 weeks, both followed by maintenance bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks in both groups) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. There was no masking in this open-label trial. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Efficacy data were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This completed study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01837251. Between Aug 1, 2013, and July 31, 2015, 682 eligible patients were enrolled, of whom 345 were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-bevacizumab (experimental group) and 337 were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin-gemcitabine-bevacizumab (standard group). Median follow-up for progression-free survival at data cutoff (July 10, 2018) was 12·4 months (IQR 8·3-21·7) in the experimental group and 11·3 months (8·0-18·4) in the standard group. Median progression-free survival was 13·3 months (95% CI 11·7-14·2) in the experimental group versus 11·6 months (11·0-12·7) in the standard group (hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·68-0·96; p=0·012). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (88 [27%] of 332 patients in the experimental group vs 67 [20%] of 329 patients in the standard group) and neutropenia (40 [12%] vs 73 [22%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 33 (10%) of 332 patients in the experimental group and 28 (9%) of 329 in the standard group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in one patient in the experimental group (<1%; large intestine perforation) and two patients in the standard group (1%; one case each of osmotic demyelination syndrome and intracranial haemorrhage).

"Gemcitabine plus carboplatin compared with carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer: an intergroup trial of the AGO-OVAR, the NCIC CTG, and the EORTC GCG. Most patients with advanced ovarian cancer develop recurrent disease. For those patients who recur at least 6 months after initial therapy, paclitaxel platinum has shown a modest survival advantage over platinum without paclitaxel; however, many patients develop clinically relevant neurotoxicity, frequently resulting in treatment discontinuation. Thus, an alternative regimen without significant neurotoxicity was evaluated by comparing gemcitabine plus carboplatin with single-agent carboplatin in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine plus carboplatin or carboplatin alone, every 21 days. The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS). Three hundred fifty-six patients (178 gemcitabine plus carboplatin; 178 carboplatin) were randomly assigned. Patients received a median of six cycles in both arms. With a median follow-up of 17 months, median PFS was 8.6 months (95% CI, 7.9 to 9.7 months) for gemcitabine plus carboplatin and 5.8 months (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.1 months) for carboplatin. The hazard ration (HR) for PFS was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.90; P = .0031). Response rate was 47.2% (95% CI, 39.9% to 54.5%) for gemcitabine plus carboplatin and 30.9% (95% CI, 24.1% to 37.7%) for carboplatin (P = .0016). The HR for overall survival was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.75 to1.23; P = .7349). While myelosuppression was significantly more common in the combination, sequelae such as febrile neutropenia or infections were uncommon. No statistically significant differences in quality of life scores between arms were noted.

"Maintenance strategies after first-line oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (AIO 0207): a randomised, non-inferiority, open-label, phase 3 trial. The definition of a best maintenance strategy following combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer is unclear. We investigated whether no continuation of therapy or bevacizumab alone are non-inferior to fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, following induction treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab. In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trial, we included patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed, previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, no pre-existing neuropathy greater than grade 1, and measurable disease, from 55 hospitals and 51 private practices in Germany. After 24 weeks of induction therapy with either fluorouracil plus leucovorin plus oxaliplatin or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin, both with bevacizumab, patients without disease progression were randomly assigned centrally by fax (1:1:1) to standard maintenance treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, bevacizumab alone, or no treatment. Both patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. Stratification criteria were response status, termination of oxaliplatin, previous adjuvant treatment with oxaliplatin, and ECOG performance status. At first progression, re-induction with all drugs of the induction treatment was a planned part of the protocol. Time to failure of strategy was the primary endpoint, defined as time from randomisation to second progression after maintenance (and if applicable re-induction), death, or initiation of further treatment including a new drug. Time to failure of strategy was equivalent to time to first progression for patients who did not receive re-induction (for any reason). The boundary for assessment of non-inferiority was upper limit of the one-sided 98·8% CI 1·43. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The study has completed recruitment, but follow-up of participants is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00973609. Between Sept 17, 2009, and Feb 21, 2013, 837 patients were enrolled and 472 randomised; 158 were randomly assigned to receive fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, 156 to receive bevacizumab monotherapy, and 158 to receive no treatment. Median follow-up from randomisation is 17·0 months (IQR 9·5-25·4). Median time to failure of strategy was 6·9 months (95% CI 6·1-8·5) for the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 6·1 months (5·3-7·4) for the bevacizumab alone group, and 6·4 months (4·8-7·6) for the no treatment group. Bevacizumab alone was non-inferior to standard fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 1·08 [95% CI 0·85-1·37]; p=0·53; upper limit of the one-sided 99·8% CI 1·42), whereas no treatment was not (HR 1·26 [0·99-1·60]; p=0·056; upper limit of the one-sided 99·8% CI 1·65). The protocol-defined re-induction after first progression was rarely done (30 [19%] patients in the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 67 [43%] in the bevacizumab monotherapy group, and 73 [46%] in the no treatment group. The most common grade 3 adverse event was sensory neuropathy (21 [13%] of 158 patients in the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 22 [14%] of 156 patients in the bevacizumab alone group, and 12 [8%] of 158 patients in the no treatment group). Although non-inferiority for bevacizumab alone was demonstrated for the primary endpoint, maintenance treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab may be the preferable option for patients following an induction treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab, as it allows the planned discontinuation of the initial combination without compromising time with controlled disease. Only a few patients were exposed to re-induction treatment, thus deeming the primary endpoint time to failure of strategy non-informative and clinically irrelevant. Progression-free survival and overall survival should be considered primary endpoints in future trials exploring maintenance strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26361971/,26361971,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab compared to Bevacizumab monotherapy when used to treat Colorectal cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab versus Bevacizumab monotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab and Bevacizumab monotherapy for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab versus Bevacizumab monotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab when compared with Bevacizumab monotherapy for Colorectal cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab in comparison to Bevacizumab monotherapy for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab compared to Bevacizumab monotherapy for addressing Colorectal cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab and Bevacizumab monotherapy in the treatment of Colorectal cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab against Bevacizumab monotherapy for managing Colorectal cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab compared to Bevacizumab monotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab contrasted with Bevacizumab monotherapy in relation to Colorectal cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab versus Bevacizumab monotherapy for treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab and Bevacizumab monotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab as opposed to Bevacizumab monotherapy in managing Colorectal cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab compared to Bevacizumab monotherapy in the context of Colorectal cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab compares to Bevacizumab monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Colorectal cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab in relation to Bevacizumab monotherapy for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab versus Bevacizumab monotherapy for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab's efficacy in comparison with Bevacizumab monotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Fluoropyrimidine and Bevacizumab against Bevacizumab monotherapy regarding Colorectal cancer.,3,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00973609,"{""26361971"": ""Susanna Hegewisch-Becker|Ullrich Graeven|Christian A Lerchenmüller|Birgitta Killing|Reinhard Depenbusch|Claus-Christoph Steffens|Salah-Eddin Al-Batran|Thoralf Lange|Georg Dietrich|Jan Stoehlmacher|Andrea Tannapfel|Anke Reinacher-Schick|Julia Quidde|Tanja Trarbach|Axel Hinke|Hans-Joachim Schmoll|Dirk Arnold""}",2009-08,Yes,Yes,Rectal,Anti-vegf
"First-line penpulimab combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin for metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer in China (AK105-302): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial. Penpulimab is a novel programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitor. This study aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of first line penpulimab plus chemotherapy for advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer from 74 hospitals in China. Eligible participants were aged 18-75 years, had histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced (stage IIIb or IIIc) or metastatic (stage IV) squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were ineligible to complete surgical resection and concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, did not have previous systemic chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, and had one or more measurable lesions according to RECIST (version 1.1). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous penpulimab 200 mg or placebo (excipient of penpulimab injection), plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and carboplatin AUC of 5 intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by penpulimab or placebo as maintenance therapy. Stratification was done according to the PD-L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs 1-49% vs ≥50%) and sex (male vs female). The participants, investigators, and other research staff were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was progression-free survival assessed by the masked Independent Radiology Review Committee in the intention-to-treat population and patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 1% or more (PD-L1-positive subgroup). The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned participants) and the PD-L1-positive subgroup. The safety analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug after enrolment. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03866993). Between Dec 20, 2018, and Oct 10, 2020, 485 patients were screened, and 350 participants were randomly assigned (175 in the penpulimab group and 175 in the placebo group). Of 350 participants, 324 (93%) were male and 26 (7%) were female, and 347 (99%) were of Han ethnicity. In the final analysis (June 1, 2022; median follow-up, 24·7 months [IQR 0-41·4]), the penpulimab group showed an improved progression-free survival compared with the placebo group, both in the intention-to-treat population (median 7·6 months, 95% CI 6·8--9·6 vs 4·2 months, 95% CI 4·2-4·3; HR 0·43, 95% CI 0·33-0·56; p<0·0001) and in the PD-L1-positive subgroup (8·1 months, 5·7-9·7 vs 4·2 months, 4·1-4·3; HR 0·37, 0·27-0·52, p<0·0001). Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 120 (69%) 173 patients in the penpulimab group and 119 (68%) of 175 in the placebo group. Penpulimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer compared with chemotherapy alone.

"Alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated Asian patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ALESIA): a randomised phase 3 study. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK-positive) disease occurs in approximately 5% of all patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, with a similar incidence reported in Asian patients. This study is the first phase 3 randomised trial recruiting only Asian patients to compare alectinib with crizotinib as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with 600 mg of alectinib twice per day. This study assessed consistency of the progression-free survival benefit with the global phase 3 ALEX study. In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 21 investigational sites in China, South Korea, and Thailand, Asian patients, aged 18 years or older, with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) to twice-daily oral alectinib (600 mg) or crizotinib (250 mg). Patients were randomly assigned via a block-stratified (block size three) randomisation procedure, done centrally via an interactive voice or web response system, with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and baseline CNS metastases. Clinical staff and the funder's drug safety and medical monitoring staff had access to treatment assignments. The independent review committee was masked to treatment assignment, and funder personnel did not have access to efficacy and safety summaries by treatment group, before the formal reporting of study results. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were permitted. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients. The primary analysis population for safety was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02838420. Between Aug 3, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 187 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 125 to alectinib and 62 to crizotinib. Median follow-up was 16·2 months (IQR 13·7-17·6) in the alectinib group, and 15·0 months (12·5-17·3) in the crizotinib group. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with alectinib versus crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95% CI 0·13-0·38; p<0·0001; median progression-free survival not estimable vs 11·1 months). Independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the alectinib group compared with the crizotinib group (HR 0·37, 0·22-0·61; p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 114 (91%) of 125 with alectinib, and 48 (77%) of 62 with crizotinib, with a longer duration of response for alectinib than crizotinib (HR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12-0·40; p<0·0001). Time to CNS progression (cause-specific HR 0·14) and the percentage of patients who achieved a CNS objective response with measurable or non-measurable baseline CNS lesions were improved (32 [73%] of 44 patients treated with alectinib vs five [22%] of 23 patients treated with crizotinib). Despite longer treatment duration with alectinib than crizotinib (14·7 months vs 12·6 months, respectively), fewer patients had grade 3-5 adverse events (36 [29%] of 125 vs 30 [48%] of 62, respectively) or serious adverse events (19 [15%] of 125 vs 16 [26%] of 62, respectively).

"Postremission treatment of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission after intensive induction chemotherapy: results of the multicenter randomized Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) 9803 trial. In elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated intensively, no best postremission strategy has emerged yet. This clinical trial enrolled 416 patients with AML aged 65 years or older who were considered eligible for standard intensive chemotherapy, with a first randomization comparing idarubicin with daunorubicin for all treatment sequences. After induction, an ambulatory postremission strategy based on 6 consolidation cycles administered monthly in outpatients was randomly compared with an intensive strategy with a single intensive consolidation course similar to induction. Complete remission (CR) rate was 57% with 10% induction deaths, and estimated overall survival was 27% at 2 years and 12% at 4 years, without notable differences between anthracycline arms. Among the 236 patients who reached CR, 164 (69%) were randomized for the postremission comparison. In these patients, the multivariate odds ratio in favor of the ambulatory arm was 1.51 for disease-free survival (P.05) and 1.59 for overall survival from CR (P.04). Despite repeated courses of chemotherapy associated with a longer time under treatment, the ambulatory arm was associated with significantly shorter rehospitalization duration and lower red blood cell unit and platelet transfusion requirements than observed in the intensive arm. In conclusion, more prolonged ambulatory treatment should be preferred to intensive chemotherapy as postremission therapy in elderly patients with AML reaching CR after standard intensive remission induction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17341661/,17341661,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin compared to 4d plus 7 when used to treat Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin versus 4d plus 7 in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin and 4d plus 7 for managing Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin versus 4d plus 7 in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin when compared with 4d plus 7 for Acute myeloid leukemia?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin in comparison to 4d plus 7 for the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin compared to 4d plus 7 for addressing Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin and 4d plus 7 in the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin against 4d plus 7 for managing Acute myeloid leukemia.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin compared to 4d plus 7 in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin contrasted with 4d plus 7 in relation to Acute myeloid leukemia?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin versus 4d plus 7 for treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin and 4d plus 7 in treating Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin as opposed to 4d plus 7 in managing Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin compared to 4d plus 7 in the context of Acute myeloid leukemia.,What option most accurately summarizes how Cytarabine and Daunorubicin compares to 4d plus 7 in terms of effectiveness for Acute myeloid leukemia?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin in relation to 4d plus 7 for the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin versus 4d plus 7 for managing Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin's efficacy in comparison with 4d plus 7 in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin against 4d plus 7 regarding Acute myeloid leukemia.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00363025,"{""17341661"": ""Claude Gardin|Pascal Turlure|Thierry Fagot|Xavier Thomas|Christine Terre|Nathalie Contentin|Emmanuel Raffoux|Stephane de Botton|Cecile Pautas|Oumedaly Reman|Jean-Henri Bourhis|Pierre Fenaux|Sylvie Castaigne|Mauricette Michallet|Claude Preudhomme|Thierry de Revel|Dominique Bordessoule|Herve Dombret""}",1999-11,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Chemotherapy|Monoclonal Antibodies
"Randomized Phase II Study of Clofarabine-Based Consolidation for Younger Adults With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Remission. Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a clofarabine-based combination (CLARA) versus conventional high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) as postremission chemotherapy in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 59 years old with intermediate- or unfavorable-risk AML in first remission and no identified donor for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) were eligible. Two hundred twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive three CLARA or three HDAC consolidation cycles. The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS). To handle the confounding effect of SCT that could occur in patients with late donor identification, hazard ratios (HRs) of events were adjusted on the time-dependent treatment × SCT interaction term. Results At 2 years, RFS was 58.5% (95% CI, 49% to 67%) in the CLARA arm and 46.5% (95% CI, 37% to 55%) in the HDAC arm. Overall, 110 patients (55 in each arm) received SCT in first remission. On the basis of a multivariable Cox-adjusted treatment × SCT interaction, the HR of CLARA over HDAC before or in absence of SCT was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.98; P = .041). In a sensitivity analysis, when patients who received SCT in first remission were censored at SCT time, 2-year RFS was 53.3% (95% CI, 39% to 66%) in the CLARA arm and 31.0% (95% CI, 19% to 43%) in the HDAC arm (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.98; P = .043). Gain in RFS could be related to the lower cumulative incidence of relapse observed in the CLARA arm versus the HDAC arm (33.9% v 46.4% at 2 years, respectively; cause-specific HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.94; P = .025). CLARA cycles were associated with higher hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity than HDAC cycles.

The Mf consisted of intravenous mitomycin-C (20 mg/m(2)) at 3-6 weeks after surgery and oral doxifluridine (460-600 mg/m(2)/day) starting 4 weeks after the administration of mitomycin-C and continuing for 3 months. The iceMFP consisted of intraoperative intraperitoneal cisplatin (100 mg), intravenous mitomycin-C (15 mg/m(2)) on postoperative day 1, followed by oral doxifluridine for 12 months, and six monthly intravenous cisplatin (60 mg/m(2)). The primary endpoint was 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). A total of 521 patients (258 in Mf, 263 in iceMFP) were eligible for analysis after excluding patients with stage I disease, distant metastasis, or R1 resection. With a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the iceMFP group had a higher RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.90; p = 0.006; 3-year RFS 60 % vs. 50 %) and overall survival (HR 0.71; 95 % CI 0.53-0.95; p = 0.02; 3-year overall survival, 71 vs. 60 %) compared with the Mf group. This was confirmed at extension analysis after a median 6.6 years of follow-up. Both regimens were well tolerated with no differences in surgical complications. The efficacy of adjuvant Mf was significantly improved by the additional therapeutic strategies of iceMFP. Considering negative results of AMC0201, these suggest that early initiation of chemotherapy and/or intraperitoneal cisplatin played a distinct role in the improved efficacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24162381/,24162381,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of iceMFP compared to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin when used to treat Gastric cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of iceMFP versus Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in treating Gastric cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of iceMFP and Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for managing Gastric cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of iceMFP versus Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in treating Gastric cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of iceMFP when compared with Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for Gastric cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of iceMFP in comparison to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for the treatment of Gastric cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of iceMFP compared to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for addressing Gastric cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of iceMFP and Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in the treatment of Gastric cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of iceMFP against Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for managing Gastric cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of iceMFP compared to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in treating Gastric cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of iceMFP contrasted with Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in relation to Gastric cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of iceMFP versus Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for treating Gastric cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of iceMFP and Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in treating Gastric cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of iceMFP as opposed to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in managing Gastric cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of iceMFP compared to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in the context of Gastric cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how iceMFP compares to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in terms of effectiveness for Gastric cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of iceMFP in relation to Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for the treatment of Gastric cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of iceMFP versus Doxifluridine and Mitomycin for managing Gastric cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of iceMFP's efficacy in comparison with Doxifluridine and Mitomycin in treating Gastric cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of iceMFP against Doxifluridine and Mitomycin regarding Gastric cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00296322,"{""24162381"": ""Yoon-Koo Kang|Jeong Hwan Yook|Heung-Moon Chang|Min-Hee Ryu|Changhoon Yoo|Dae Young Zang|Jae-Lyun Lee|Tae Won Kim|Dae Hyun Yang|Se Jin Jang|Young Soo Park|Young Jack Lee|Hwoon-Yong Jung|Jin-Ho Kim|Byung Sik Kim""}",2001-10,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"Oral apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered in fixed doses, may simplify the treatment of venous thromboembolism. In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months) with conventional therapy (subcutaneous enoxaparin, followed by warfarin) in 5395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcomes were major bleeding alone and major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 59 of 2609 patients (2.3%) in the apixaban group, as compared with 71 of 2635 (2.7%) in the conventional-therapy group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.18; difference in risk [apixaban minus conventional therapy], -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.4). Apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (P<0.001) for predefined upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for both relative risk (<1.80) and difference in risk (<3.5 percentage points). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who received apixaban and in 1.8% of those who received conventional therapy (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.55; P<0.001 for superiority). The composite outcome of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the patients in the apixaban group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the conventional-therapy group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.55; P<0.001). Rates of other adverse events were similar in the two groups.

"Anagrelide compared with hydroxyurea in WHO-classified essential thrombocythemia: the ANAHYDRET Study, a randomized controlled trial. High platelet counts in essential thrombocythemia (ET) can be effectively lowered by treatment with either anagrelide or hydroxyurea. In 259 previously untreated, high-risk patients with ET, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization classification system, the efficacy and tolerability of anagrelide compared with hydroxyurea were investigated in a prospective randomized noninferiority phase 3 study in an a priori-ordered hypothesis. Confirmatory proof of the noninferiority of anagrelide was achieved after 6 months using the primary end point criteria and was further confirmed after an observation time of 12 and 36 months for platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, leukocyte counts (P < .001), and ET-related events (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.61-2.30], 1.03 [95% CI, 0.57-1.81], and 0.92 [95% CI, 0.57-1.46], respectively). During the total observation time of 730 patient-years, there was no significant difference between the anagrelide and hydroxyurea group regarding incidences of major arterial (7 vs 8) and venous (2 vs 6) thrombosis, severe bleeding events (5 vs 2), minor arterial (24 vs 20) and venous (3 vs 3) thrombosis and minor bleeding events (18 vs 15), or rates of discontinuation (adverse events 12 vs 15 or lack of response 5 vs 2).

"Adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin versus observation in patients with completely resected stage IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association [ANITA]): a randomised controlled trial. Whether adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not known. We aimed to compare the effect of adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin versus observation on survival in patients with completely resected NSCLC. 840 patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC from 101 centres in 14 countries were randomly assigned to observation (n=433) or to 30 mg/m(2) vinorelbine plus 100 mg/m(2) cisplatin (n=407). Postoperative radiotherapy was not mandatory and was undertaken according to every centre's policy. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN95053737. 367 patients in the chemotherapy group and 431 in the control group received their assigned treatment. 301 (36%) patients had stage IB disease, 203 (24%) had stage II disease, and 325 (39%) had stage IIIA disease. Tolerance to chemotherapy mainly included neutropenia in 335 (92%) patients and febrile neutropenia in 34 (9%); seven (2%) toxic deaths were also recorded.

In this open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study (ARIEL4), conducted in 64 hospitals and cancer centres across 12 countries (Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, the UK, and the USA), we recruited patients aged 18 years and older with BRCA1-mutated or BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had received two or more previous chemotherapy regimens. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1), using an interactive response technology and block randomisation (block size of six) and stratified by progression-free interval after the most recent platinum-containing therapy, to oral rucaparib (600 mg twice daily) or chemotherapy (administered per institutional guidelines). Patients assigned to the chemotherapy group with platinum-resistant or partially platinum-sensitive disease were given paclitaxel (starting dose 60-80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15); those with fully platinum-sensitive disease received platinum-based chemotherapy (single-agent cisplatin or carboplatin, or platinum-doublet chemotherapy). Patients were treated in 21-day or 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, assessed in the efficacy population (all randomly assigned patients with deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations without reversion mutations), and then in the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients). Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of assigned study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02855944; enrolment is complete, and the study is ongoing. Between March 1, 2017, and Sept 24, 2020, 930 patients were screened, of whom 349 eligible patients were randomly assigned to rucaparib (n=233) or chemotherapy (n=116). Median age was 58 years (IQR 52-64) and 332 (95%) patients were White. As of data cutoff (Sept 30, 2020), median follow-up was 25·0 months (IQR 13·8-32·5). In the efficacy population (220 patients in the rucaparib group; 105 in the chemotherapy group), median progression-free survival was 7·4 months (95% CI 7·3-9·1) in the rucaparib group versus 5·7 months (5·5-7·3) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·64 [95% CI 0·49-0·84]; p=0·0010). In the intention-to-treat population (233 in the rucaparib group; 116 in the chemotherapy group), median progression-free survival was 7·4 months (95% CI 6·7-7·9) in the rucaparib group versus 5·7 months (5·5-6·7) in the chemotherapy group (HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·52-0·86]; p=0·0017). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse event was anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (in 52 [22%] of 232 patients in the rucaparib group vs six [5%] of 113 in the chemotherapy group). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 62 (27%) patients in the rucaparib group versus 13 (12%) in the chemotherapy group; serious adverse events considered related to treatment by the investigator occurred in 32 (14%) patients in the rucaparib group and six (5%) in the chemotherapy group. Three deaths were considered to be potentially related to rucaparib (one due to cardiac disorder, one due to myelodysplastic syndrome, and one with an unconfirmed cause). Results from the ARIEL4 study support rucaparib as an alternative treatment option to chemotherapy for patients with relapsed, BRCA1-mutated or BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinoma.

"A randomized phase III trial comparing adjuvant single-agent S1, S-1 with oxaliplatin, and postoperative chemoradiation with S-1 and oxaliplatin in patients with node-positive gastric cancer after D2 resection: the ARTIST 2 trial<sup>☆</sup>. Adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are some of the standards of care for gastric cancer (GC). The Adjuvant chemoRadioTherapy In Stomach Tumors (ARTIST) 2 trial compares two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens and chemoradiotherapy in patients with D2-resected, stage II or III, node-positive GC. The ARTIST 2 compared, in a 1:1:1 ratio, three adjuvant regimens: oral S-1 (40-60 mg twice daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off) for 1 year, S-1 (2 weeks on/1 week off) plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks (SOX) for 6 months, and SOX plus chemoradiotherapy 45 Gy (SOXRT). Randomization was stratified according to surgery type (total or subtotal gastrectomy), pathologic stage (II or III), and Lauren histologic classification (diffuse or intestinal/mixed). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years; a reduction of 33% in the hazard ratio (HR) for DFS with SOX or SOXRT, when compared with S-1, was considered clinically meaningful. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0176146). A total of 546 patients were recruited between February 2013 and January 2018 with 182, 181, and 183 patients in the S-1, SOX, and SOXRT arms, respectively. Median follow-up period was 47 months, with 178 DFS events observed. Estimated 3-year DFS rates were 64.8%, 74.3%, and 72.8% in the S-1, SOX, and SOXRT arms, respectively. HR for DFS in the control arm (S-1) was shorter than that in the SOX and SOXRT arms: S-1 versus SOX, 0.692 (P = 0.042) and S-1 versus SOXRT, 0.724 (P = 0.074). No difference in DFS was found between SOX and SOXRT (HR 0.971; P = 0.879). Adverse events were as anticipated in each arm, and were generally well-tolerated and manageable. In patients with curatively D2-resected, stage II/III, node-positive GC, adjuvant SOX or SOXRT was effective in prolonging DFS, when compared with S-1 monotherapy. The addition of radiotherapy to SOX did not significantly reduce the rate of recurrence after D2 gastrectomy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33278599/,33278599,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy compared to SOX when used to treat Gastric cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy versus SOX in treating Gastric cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of S-1 monotherapy and SOX for managing Gastric cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy versus SOX in treating Gastric cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy when compared with SOX for Gastric cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy in comparison to SOX for the treatment of Gastric cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy compared to SOX for addressing Gastric cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy and SOX in the treatment of Gastric cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of S-1 monotherapy against SOX for managing Gastric cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy compared to SOX in treating Gastric cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy contrasted with SOX in relation to Gastric cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy versus SOX for treating Gastric cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy and SOX in treating Gastric cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy as opposed to SOX in managing Gastric cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy compared to SOX in the context of Gastric cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how S-1 monotherapy compares to SOX in terms of effectiveness for Gastric cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of S-1 monotherapy in relation to SOX for the treatment of Gastric cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of S-1 monotherapy versus SOX for managing Gastric cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of S-1 monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with SOX in treating Gastric cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of S-1 monotherapy against SOX regarding Gastric cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01761461,"{""33278599"": ""S H Park|D H Lim|T S Sohn|J Lee|D Y Zang|S T Kim|J H Kang|S Y Oh|I G Hwang|J H Ji|D B Shin|J I Yu|K-M Kim|J Y An|M G Choi|J H Lee|S Kim|J Y Hong|J O Park|Y S Park|H Y Lim|J M Bae|W K Kang|ARTIST 2 investigators""}",2013-02-06,Yes,No,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"Efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase III ARTIST trial. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab with modified irinotecan, leucovorin bolus, and 5-fluorouracil intravenous infusion (mIFL) in the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has not been well evaluated in randomized clinical trials in Chinese patients. We conducted a phrase III trial in which patients with previously untreated mCRC were randomized 2:1 to the mIFL [irinotecan (125 mg/m(2)), leucovorin (20 mg/m(2)) bolus, and 5-fluorouracil intravenous infusion (500 mg/m(2)) weekly for four weeks every six weeks] plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every two weeks) group and the mIFL group, respectively. Co-primary objectives were progression-free survival (PFS) and 6-month PFS rate. In total, 214 patients were enrolled. Our results showed that addition of bevacizumab to mIFL significantly improved median PFS (4.2 months in the mIFL group vs. 8.3 months in the bevacizumab plus mIFL group, P < 0.001), 6-month PFS rate (25.0% vs. 62.6%, P < 0.001), median overall survival (13.4 months vs. 18.7 months, P = 0.014), and response rate (17% vs. 35%, P = 0.013).

"ARTSCAN III: A Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Chemoradiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Cetuximab in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer. We performed an open-label randomized controlled phase III study comparing treatment outcome and toxicity between radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant cisplatin versus concomitant cetuximab in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; stage III-IV according to the Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification, 7th edition). Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either intravenous cetuximab 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> 1 week before start of RT followed by 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/wk, or weekly intravenous cisplatin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, during RT. RT was conventionally fractionated. Patients with T3-T4 tumors underwent a second random assignment 1:1 between standard RT dose 68.0 Gy to the primary tumor or dose escalation to 73.1 Gy. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) evaluated using adjusted Cox regression analysis. Secondary end points were locoregional control, local control with dose-escalated RT, pattern of failure, and adverse effects. Study inclusion was prematurely closed after an unplanned interim analysis when 298 patients had been randomly assigned. At 3 years, OS was 88% (95% CI, 83% to 94%) and 78% (95% CI, 71% to 85%) in the cisplatin and cetuximab groups, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.86; <i>P</i> = .086). The cumulative incidence of locoregional failures at 3 years was 23% (95% CI, 16% to 31%) compared with 9% (95% CI, 4% to 14%) in the cetuximab versus the cisplatin group (Gray's test <i>P</i> = .0036). The cumulative incidence of distant failures did not differ between the treatment groups. Dose escalation in T3-T4 tumors did not increase local control. Cetuximab is inferior to cisplatin regarding locoregional control for concomitant treatment with RT in patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC.

"Everolimus versus sunitinib for patients with metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ASPEN): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 2 trial. Non-clear cell renal cell carcinomas are histologically and genetically diverse kidney cancers with variable prognoses, and their optimum initial treatment is unknown. We aimed to compare the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the VEGF receptor inhibitor sunitinib in patients with non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We enrolled patients with metastatic papillary, chromophobe, or unclassified non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma with no history of previous systemic treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive everolimus (10 mg/day) or sunitinib (50 mg/day; 6-week cycles of 4 weeks with treatment followed by 2 weeks without treatment) administered orally until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk group and papillary histology. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Safety was assessed in all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01108445. Between Sept 23, 2010, and Oct 28, 2013, 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive either sunitinib (n=51) or everolimus (n=57). As of December, 2014, 87 progression-free survival events had occurred with two remaining active patients, and the trial was closed for the primary analysis. Sunitinib significantly increased progression-free survival compared with everolimus (8·3 months [80% CI 5·8-11·4] vs 5·6 months [5·5-6·0]; hazard ratio 1·41 [80% CI 1·03-1·92]; p=0·16), although heterogeneity of the treatment effect was noted on the basis of histological subtypes and prognostic risk groups. No unexpected toxic effects were reported, and the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (12 [24%] of 51 patients in the sunitinib group vs one [2%] of 57 patients in the everolimus group), infection (six [12%] vs four [7%]), diarrhoea (five [10%] vs one [2%]), pneumonitis (none vs five [9%]), stomatitis (none vs five [9%]), and hand-foot syndrome (four [8%] vs none).

"Phase 3 randomised study of canfosfamide (Telcyta, TLK286) versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan as third-line therapy in patients with platinum-refractory or -resistant ovarian cancer. Canfosfamide HCl (CAN) is a glutathione analogue prodrug that is activated by glutathione S-transferase P1-1 and induces apoptosis. CAN is synergistic in vitro with carboplatin, paclitaxel and anthracyclines. Patients with platinum-refractory or -resistant ovarian cancer (OC) who had progressed on second-line therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) or topotecan (TOPO), were randomised between CAN 1000 mg/m(2) IV q 3 weeks or to either PLD 50mg/m(2) IV q 4 weeks or TOPO 1.5mg/m(2) IV d1-5 q 3 weeks. About 461 patients were randomised after stratification for ECOG performance status, prior therapy, and bulky (>5 cm) disease. Groups were well balanced. In the control arm 58% and 42% were treated with PLD and TOPO, respectively. CAN was well tolerated with the most common grade 3-4 toxicities of 5% anaemia, 4% neutropaenia (no febrile neutropaenia), 4% thrombocytopaenia, and 7% vomiting. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in the control arm (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). In a subgroup analysis PFS and OS tended to be higher with PLD than with TOPO. CAN was well tolerated. This is the first randomised study showing an increased OS with third-line therapy.

"Rituximab biosimilar and reference rituximab in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma (ASSIST-FL): primary results from a confirmatory phase 3, double-blind, randomised, controlled study. GP2013 is a rituximab biosimilar developed to stringent development guidelines, including non-clinical and preclinical investigations and clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and follicular lymphoma. We aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GP2013 plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (GP2013-CVP) with rituximab-CVP (R-CVP) in patients with follicular lymphoma. In this phase 3, multinational, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial, adults (aged 18 years or older) with previously untreated, advanced stage (Ann Arbor stage III or IV) follicular lymphoma of WHO histological grades 1, 2, or 3a were randomly assigned (1:1) using interactive response technology to eight cycles of GP2013-CVP or R-CVP (combination phase), followed by monotherapy maintenance in responders for a 2-year period. Randomisation was stratified by Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index risk group and geographic region. The primary endpoint was comparability in overall response, with equivalence concluded if the entire 95% CI was within a margin of -12% to 12%. The primary endpoint was analysed using the per-protocol set, which included all patients who received at least one (partial or complete) dose of investigational treatment and who did not have any major protocol deviations. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01419665, and is ongoing. Between Dec 1, 2011, and Jan 15, 2015, 858 patients were screened for eligibility. 314 patients were randomly assigned to GP2013, of whom 312 were given GP2013, and 315 were assigned to reference rituximab. Median follow-up was 11·6 months (IQR 5·8-18·2) for the primary analysis. The primary endpoint, equivalence of overall response, was met (271 [87%] of 311 patients with GP2013 and 274 [88%] of 313 patients with reference rituximab achieved an overall response; difference -0·40% [95% CI -5·94 to 5·14]). Occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar between the treatment groups (289 [93%] of 312 patients in the GP2013-CVP group had an adverse event and 71 [23%] of 312 patients had a serious adverse event; 288 [91%] of 315 patients in the R-CVP group had an adverse event and 63 [20%] had a serious adverse event). The most common adverse event was neutropenia (80 [26%] of 312 patients in the GP2013-CVP group and 93 [30%] of 315 patients in the R-CVP group in the combination phase and 23 [10%] of 231 patients in the GP2013-CVP group and 13 [6%] of 231 patients in the R-CVP group in the maintenance phase). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event during the combination and maintenance phase was neutropenia (55 [18%] of 312 patients in the GP2013-CVP group and 65 [21%] of 315 patients in the R-CVP group in the combination phase and 17 [7%] of 231 patients in the GP2013-CVP group and nine [4%] of 231 patients in the R-CVP group in the maintenance phase). The occurrence of anti-drug antibodies was similar in the treatment groups (five [2%] of 268 patients in the GP2013-CVP; three [1%] in the R-CVP group). Our results show that GP2013 represents a viable rituximab biosimilar candidate for patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma. The introduction of biosimilars provides additional therapeutic options with potential to increase access to effective and life-saving biological therapies such as rituximab.

"Effect of First-Line Serplulimab vs Placebo Added to Chemotherapy on Survival in Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: The ASTRUM-005 Randomized Clinical Trial. Programmed cell death ligand 1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy has changed the approach to first-line treatment in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It remained unknown whether adding a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor to chemotherapy provided similar or better benefits in patients with extensive-stage SCLC, which would add evidence on the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. To evaluate the efficacy and adverse event profile of the PD-1 inhibitor serplulimab plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with extensive-stage SCLC. This international, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical trial (ASTRUM-005) enrolled patients at 114 hospital sites in 6 countries between September 12, 2019, and April 27, 2021. Of 894 patients who were screened, 585 with extensive-stage SCLC who had not previously received systemic therapy were randomized. Patients were followed up through October 22, 2021. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either 4.5 mg/kg of serplulimab (n = 389) or placebo (n = 196) intravenously every 3 weeks. All patients received intravenous carboplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks for up to 12 weeks. The primary outcome was overall survival (prespecified significance threshold at the interim analysis, 2-sided P < .012). There were 13 secondary outcomes, including progression-free survival and adverse events. Among the 585 patients who were randomized (mean age, 61.1 [SD, 8.67] years; 104 [17.8%] women), 246 (42.1%) completed the trial and 465 (79.5%) discontinued study treatment. All patients received study treatment and were included in the primary analyses. As of the data cutoff (October 22, 2021) for this interim analysis, the median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (range, 0.2-24.8 months). The median overall survival was significantly longer in the serplulimab group (15.4 months [95% CI, 13.3 months-not evaluable]) than in the placebo group (10.9 months [95% CI, 10.0-14.3 months]) (hazard ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.49-0.82]; P < .001). The median progression-free survival (assessed by an independent radiology review committee) also was longer in the serplulimab group (5.7 months [95% CI, 5.5-6.9 months]) than in the placebo group (4.3 months [95% CI, 4.2-4.5 months]) (hazard ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.38-0.59]). Treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or higher occurred in 129 patients (33.2%) in the serplulimab group and in 54 patients (27.6%) in the placebo group. Among patients with previously untreated extensive-stage SCLC, serplulimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone, supporting the use of serplulimab plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for this patient population.

Immunotherapy may be synergistic with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. ATALANTE/ENGOT-ov29 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02891824), a placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized phase III trial, enrolled patients with recurrent epithelial OC, one to two previous chemotherapy lines, and PFI >6 months. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to atezolizumab (1,200 mg once every 3 weeks or equivalent) or placebo for up to 24 months, combined with bevacizumab and six cycles of chemotherapy doublet, stratified by PFI, PD-L1 status, and chemotherapy regimen. Coprimary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1-positive populations (alpha .025 for each population). Between September 2016 and October 2019, 614 patients were randomly assigned: 410 to atezolizumab and 204 to placebo. Only 38% had PD-L1-positive tumors.

"Tranexamic acid for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients: a European cross-over controlled trial in a rare disease. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder associated with abnormal angiogenesis and disabling epistaxis. Tranexamic acid (TA) has been widely used in the treatment of these severe bleeds but with no properly designed trial. To demonstrate the efficacy of TA in epistaxis in HHT patients and to explore its safety of use. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive TA (3 g a day) then placebo or the opposite sequence. The main analysis compared intra-individual mean duration of epistaxis under TA vs. placebo on a log scale. The primary outcome was the mean duration of epistaxis per month, assessed with specific grids to be completed by participants. The number of epistaxis episodes was recorded as a secondary outcome. A total of 118 randomized patients contributed to the statistical analysis. The mean duration of epistaxis per month was significantly shorter with TA than placebo (0.19 on the log scale; SD = 0.07; P = 0.005), corresponding to a decrease of 17.3% (15.7 min) in the duration of epistaxis per month (CI 95%, 5.5-27.6). The median number of epistaxis episodes per month was 22.1 episodes in the placebo arm vs. 23.3 episodes in the TA arm. No thrombophlebitis was observed. In the ATERO study, we demonstrated a significant decrease in the duration of epistaxis in HHT patients taking TA.

"Antilymphocyte Globulin for Prevention of Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease. Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the leading cause of later illness and death after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. We hypothesized that the inclusion of antihuman T-lymphocyte immune globulin (ATG) in a myeloablative conditioning regimen for patients with acute leukemia would result in a significant reduction in chronic GVHD 2 years after allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 study of ATG as part of a conditioning regimen. A total of 168 patients were enrolled at 27 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ATG or not receive ATG, with stratification according to center and risk of disease. After a median follow-up of 24 months, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 32.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to 46.7) in the ATG group and 68.7% (95% CI, 58.4 to 80.7) in the non-ATG group (P<0.001). The rate of 2-year relapse-free survival was similar in the ATG group and the non-ATG group (59.4% [95% CI, 47.8 to 69.2] and 64.6% [95% CI, 50.9 to 75.3], respectively; P=0.21), as was the rate of overall survival (74.1% [95% CI, 62.7 to 82.5] and 77.9% [95% CI, 66.1 to 86.1], respectively; P=0.46). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of relapse, infectious complications, acute GVHD, or adverse events. The rate of a composite end point of chronic GVHD-free and relapse-free survival at 2 years was significantly higher in the ATG group than in the non-ATG group (36.6% vs. 16.8%, P=0.005). The inclusion of ATG resulted in a significantly lower rate of chronic GVHD after allogeneic transplantation than the rate without ATG. The survival rate was similar in the two groups, but the rate of a composite end point of chronic GVHD-free survival and relapse-free survival was higher with ATG.

"ATLAS: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIIB trial comparing bevacizumab therapy with or without erlotinib, after completion of chemotherapy, with bevacizumab for first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. This phase III trial was performed to assess the potential benefit of adding maintenance erlotinib to bevacizumab after a first-line chemotherapy regimen with bevacizumab for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). One thousand one hundred forty-five patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC (stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion, stage IV, or recurrent) received four cycles of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Seven hundred forty-three patients without disease progression or significant toxicity were then randomly assigned (1:1) to bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, day 1, 21-day cycle) plus either placebo or erlotinib (150 mg per day). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS from time of random assignment was 3.7 months with bevacizumab/placebo and 4.8 months with bevacizumab/erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.86; P < .001). Median overall survival (OS) times from random assignment were 13.3 and 14.4 months with bevacizumab/placebo and bevacizumab/erlotinib, respectively (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.21; P = .5341). During the postchemotherapy phase, there were more adverse events (AEs) overall, more grade 3 and 4 AEs (mainly rash and diarrhea), more serious AEs, and more AEs leading to erlotinib/placebo discontinuation in the bevacizumab/erlotinib arm versus the bevacizumab/placebo arm. The incidence of AEs leading to bevacizumab discontinuation was similar in both treatment arms. The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab significantly improved PFS but not OS. Although generally well tolerated, the modest impact on survival and increased toxicity associated with the addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab maintenance mean that this two-drug maintenance regimen will not lead to a new postchemotherapy standard of care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24101054/,24101054,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy compared to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab when used to treat Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy versus Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy and Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for managing Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy versus Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy when compared with Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for Non-small cell lung cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy in comparison to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy compared to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for addressing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy and Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy against Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for managing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy compared to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy contrasted with Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in relation to Non-small cell lung cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy versus Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy and Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in treating Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy as opposed to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in managing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy compared to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in the context of Non-small cell lung cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Bevacizumab monotherapy compares to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in terms of effectiveness for Non-small cell lung cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy in relation to Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Bevacizumab monotherapy versus Erlotinib and Bevacizumab for managing Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Bevacizumab monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Erlotinib and Bevacizumab in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Bevacizumab monotherapy against Erlotinib and Bevacizumab regarding Non-small cell lung cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00257608,"{""24101054"": ""Bruce E Johnson|Fairooz Kabbinavar|Louis Fehrenbacher|John Hainsworth|Saifuddin Kasubhai|Bruce Kressel|Chin-Yu Lin|Thomas Marsland|Taral Patel|Jonathan Polikoff|Mark Rubin|Leonard White|James Chih-Hsin Yang|Chris Bowden|Vincent Miller""}",2006-01,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Anti-vegf|Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

In the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a driver mutation, the role of anti-PD-(L)1 antibody after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) remains unclear. This randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III study evaluates the efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin (ABCP ) in <i>EGFR-</i> or <i>ALK</i>-mutated NSCLC that progressed before TKI therapy. We compared the clinical efficacy of ABCP followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with pemetrexed plus carboplatin or cisplatin (PC) followed by pemetrexed maintenance. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 228 patients with activating <i>EGFR</i> mutation (n = 215) or <i>ALK</i> translocation (n = 13) were enrolled from 16 sites in the Republic of Korea and randomly assigned at 2:1 ratio to either ABCP (n = 154) or PC arm (n = 74).

"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma refractory or intolerant to previous chemotherapy (ATTRACTION-3): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Chemotherapy for patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma offers poor long-term survival prospects. We report the final analysis from our study of the immune checkpoint PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (ATTRACTION-3) at 90 hospitals and cancer centres in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. We enrolled patients aged 20 years and older with unresectable advanced or recurrent oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (regardless of PD-L1 expression), at least one measurable or non-measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and who were refractory or intolerant to one previous fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy and had a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nivolumab (240 mg for 30 min every 2 weeks) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for at least 60 min once per week for 6 weeks then 1 week off; or docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for at least 60 min every 3 weeks), all given intravenously. Treatment continued until disease progression assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was done using an interactive web response system with a block size of four and stratified according to geographical region (Japan vs rest of the world), number of organs with metastases, and PD-L1 expression. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, in the intention-to-treat population that included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02569242, and follow-up for long-term outcomes is ongoing. Between Jan 7, 2016, and May 25, 2017, we assigned 419 patients to treatment: 210 to nivolumab and 209 to chemotherapy. At the time of data cutoff on Nov 12, 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 10·5 months (IQR 4·5-19·0) in the nivolumab group and 8·0 months (4·6-15·2) in the chemotherapy group. At a minimum follow-up time (ie, time from random assignment of the last patient to data cutoff) of 17·6 months, overall survival was significantly improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median 10·9 months, 95% CI 9·2-13·3 vs 8·4 months, 7·2-9·9; hazard ratio for death 0·77, 95% CI 0·62-0·96; p=0·019). 38 (18%) of 209 patients in the nivolumab group had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events compared with 131 (63%) of 208 patients in the chemotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [2%]) in the nivolumab group and decreased neutrophil count (59 [28%]) in the chemotherapy group.

"AUGMENT: A Phase III Study of Lenalidomide Plus Rituximab Versus Placebo Plus Rituximab in Relapsed or Refractory Indolent Lymphoma. Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically respond well to first-line immunochemotherapy. At relapse, single-agent rituximab is commonly administered. Data suggest the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide could increase the activity of rituximab. A phase III, multicenter, randomized trial of lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab was conducted in patients with relapsed and/or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma. Patients received lenalidomide or placebo for 12 cycles plus rituximab once per week for 4 weeks in cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2 through 5. The primary end point was progression-free survival per independent radiology review. A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide plus rituximab (n = 178) or placebo plus rituximab (n = 180). Infections (63% <i>v</i> 49%), neutropenia (58% <i>v</i> 23%), and cutaneous reactions (32% <i>v</i> 12%) were more common with lenalidomide plus rituximab. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (50% <i>v</i> 13%) and leukopenia (7% <i>v</i> 2%) were higher with lenalidomide plus rituximab; no other grade 3 or 4 adverse event differed by 5% or more between groups. Progression-free survival was significantly improved for lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab, with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.62; <i>P</i> < .001) and median duration of 39.4 months (95% CI, 22.9 months to not reached) versus 14.1 months (95% CI, 11.4 to 16.7 months), respectively.

"Phase III study of bevacizumab plus docetaxel compared with placebo plus docetaxel for the first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The efficacy and safety of combining bevacizumab (7.5 and 15 mg/kg) with docetaxel as first-line therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) was investigated in a three-arm, placebo-controlled, phase III trial. Patients (N = 736) were randomly assigned to docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) plus either placebo or bevacizumab 7.5 or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included best overall response, duration of response, time to treatment failure, overall survival, and safety.

"Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab Biosimilar FKB238 Versus Originator Bevacizumab: Results from AVANA, a Phase III Trial in Patients with Non-Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (non-sq-NSCLC). Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor growth. FKB238, a bevacizumab biosimilar, has analytical pharmacokinetic and safety profiles similar to those of bevacizumab. This phase III trial (NCT02810457) compared the efficacy and safety of FKB238 with that of bevacizumab in patients with advanced/recurrent non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (non-sq-NSCLC). This global, multicenter, double-blind, parallel, randomized, comparative clinical trial enrolled and randomized patients with advanced/recurrent non-sq-NSCLC to receive intravenous infusions of either FKB238 15 mg/kg or bevacizumab 15 mg/kg. All patients received intravenous infusions of paclitaxel 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and carboplatin (area under the curve 6.0) immediately prior to investigational products for 4-6 cycles. FKB238 and bevacizumab were administered on day 1 of each 21-day cycle until objective progressive disease by RECIST version 1.1 or other discontinuation criteria were met. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), including complete and partial response and based on blinded independent central review assessment. Other efficacy determinations included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunogenicity. Adverse events and severity were reported. The ORR for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N = 731) was 51.6% in the FKB238 arm (N = 364) and 53.7% in the bevacizumab arm (N = 367). The FKB238:bevacizumab ORR ratio (ITT population) was 0.96 (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-1.08), and the difference in ORR (per-protocol set) between FKB238 and bevacizumab was - 0.02 (95% CI - 0.09 to 0.06). Both CIs fell within the prespecified equivalence margins. Estimated median PFS was 7.72 and 7.62 months in the FKB238 and bevacizumab arms, respectively (hazard ratio 0.97; 95% CI 0.82-1.16). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 94.2% and 95.1% of patients in the FKB238 and bevacizumab arms, respectively. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported for 53.6% and 55.5% of patients in the FKB238 and bevacizumab arms, respectively. Serious TEAEs were reported for 25.1% and 26.0% of patients treated with FKB238 and bevacizumab, respectively. Efficacy equivalence was demonstrated between the two drugs, and safety profiles were similar. There were no meaningful differences in efficacy and safety between FKB238 or bevacizumab in patients with non-sq-NSCLC.

"AVEREL: a randomized phase III Trial evaluating bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel and trastuzumab as first-line therapy for HER2-positive locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE The AVEREL trial [A Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Herceptin (Trastuzumab)/Docetaxel in Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer] evaluated first-line bevacizumab-containing therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer (LR/MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable/evaluable HER2-positive LR/MBC who had not received trastuzumab or chemotherapy for LR/MBC were stratified by prior adjuvant trastuzumab, prior (neo)adjuvant taxane, hormone receptor status, and measurable disease and were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) plus trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg either with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg or without bevacizumab, all administered every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional end points included overall survival, response rate (RR), safety, quality of life, and translational research. Results Baseline characteristics of the 424 patients were balanced between treatment arms. Most patients had visceral metastases, 43% had a disease-free interval less than 12 months, and 85% had measurable disease. Median follow-up was 26 months. The hazard ratio for investigator-assessed PFS was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.02; P = .0775; median PFS, 13.7 v 16.5 months in the non-bevacizumab and bevacizumab arms, respectively; PFS events in 72%). The Independent Review Committee-assessed PFS hazard ratio was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.94; P = .0162; median PFS, 13.9 v 16.8 months, respectively; PFS events in 53%). The RR was 70% versus 74%, respectively (P = .3492). Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia and hypertension were more common with bevacizumab-containing therapy. High baseline plasma vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) concentrations were associated with greater bevacizumab benefit (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION Combining bevacizumab with docetaxel and trastuzumab did not significantly improve investigator-assessed PFS. The potential predictive value of plasma VEGF-A is consistent with findings in HER2-negative LR/MBC, warranting prospective evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23569311/,23569311,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) compared to BTH (Docetaxel) when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) versus BTH (Docetaxel) in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) and BTH (Docetaxel) for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) versus BTH (Docetaxel) in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) when compared with BTH (Docetaxel) for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) in comparison to BTH (Docetaxel) for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) compared to BTH (Docetaxel) for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) and BTH (Docetaxel) in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) against BTH (Docetaxel) for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) compared to BTH (Docetaxel) in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) contrasted with BTH (Docetaxel) in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) versus BTH (Docetaxel) for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) and BTH (Docetaxel) in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) as opposed to BTH (Docetaxel) in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) compared to BTH (Docetaxel) in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) compares to BTH (Docetaxel) in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) in relation to BTH (Docetaxel) for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) versus BTH (Docetaxel) for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH)'s efficacy in comparison with BTH (Docetaxel) in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (TH) against BTH (Docetaxel) regarding Breast cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00391092,"{""23569311"": ""Luca Gianni|Gilles H Romieu|Michail Lichinitser|Sergio V Serrano|Mauro Mansutti|Xavier Pivot|Paola Mariani|Fabrice Andre|Arlene Chan|Oleg Lipatov|Stephen Chan|Andrew Wardley|Richard Greil|Nicola Moore|Sylvie Prot|Celine Pallaud|Vladimir Semiglazov""}",2006-09,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Anti-vegf|Taxanes
"Modified XELIRI (capecitabine plus irinotecan) versus FOLFIRI (leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan), both either with or without bevacizumab, as second-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (AXEPT): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial. Studies of a modified XELIRI (mXELIRI; capecitabine plus irinotecan) regimen suggest promising efficacy and tolerability profiles in the first-line and second-line settings. Therefore, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the mXELIRI regimen with that of standard FOLFIRI (leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan), with or without bevacizumab in both regimens, as a second-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial. We enrolled patients from 98 hospitals in Japan, China, and South Korea who were aged 20 years or older with histologically confirmed and unresectable colorectal adenocarcinoma, and who had withdrawn from first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive either mXELIRI with or without bevacizumab (irinotecan 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1 plus oral capecitabine 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily on days 1-14, repeated every 21 days, with or without bevacizumab 7·5 mg/kg intravenously on day 1) or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab (irinotecan 180 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, leucovorin 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1, and a 46-h continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil [2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>], repeated every 14 days, with or without the addition of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously on day 1) via a centralised electronic system. We used the minimisation method to stratify randomisation by country, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, number of metastatic sites, previous oxaliplatin treatment, and concomitant bevacizumab treatment. Patients and clinicians were not masked to the allocated treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a non-inferiority upper margin of 1·30 for the hazard ratio (HR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01996306, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants. Between Dec 2, 2013, and Aug 13, 2015, 650 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive mXELIRI with or without bevacizumab (n=326) or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab (n=324). After a median follow-up of 15·8 months (IQR 8·7-24·9), a total of 490 patients had died (242 in the mXELIRI with or without bevacizumab group and 248 in the FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab group) and the median overall survival was 16·8 months (95% CI 15·3-19·1) in the mXELIRI group and 15·4 months (13·0-17·7) in the FOLFIRI group (HR 0·85, 95% CI 0·71-1·02; p<sub>non-inferiority</sub><0·0001). In the per-protocol safety population, the most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (affecting 52 [17%] of 310 patients in the mXELIRI group and 133 [43%] of 310 in the FOLFIRI group). Incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea were higher in the mXELIRI group (22 [7%]) than in the FOLFIRI group (ten [3%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 46 (15%) of 310 patients in the mXELIRI group and 63 (20%) of 310 in the FOLFIRI group. Two treatment-related deaths (one pneumonitis and one lung infection) were observed in the mXELIRI group and there was one treatment-related death (lung infection) in the FOLFIRI group. mXELIRI with or without bevacizumab is well tolerated and non-inferior to FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab in terms of overall survival. mXELIRI could be an alternative to FOLFIRI as a standard second-line backbone treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, at least for Asian patient populations.

"Azacitidine prolongs overall survival compared with conventional care regimens in elderly patients with low bone marrow blast count acute myeloid leukemia. In a phase III randomized trial, azacitidine significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with conventional care regimens (CCRs) in patients with intermediate-2- and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Approximately one third of these patients were classified as having acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under current WHO criteria. This analysis compared the effects of azacitidine versus CCR on OS in this subgroup. Patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous azacitidine 75 mg/m(2)/d or CCR (best supportive care [BSC] only, low-dose cytarabine (LDAC), or intensive chemotherapy [IC]). Of the 113 elderly patients (median age, 70 years) randomly assigned to receive azacitidine (n = 55) or CCR (n = 58; 47% BSC, 34% LDAC, 19% IC), 86% were considered unfit for IC. At a median follow-up of 20.1 months, median OS for azacitidine-treated patients was 24.5 months compared with 16.0 months for CCR-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.79; P = .005), and 2-year OS rates were 50% and 16%, respectively (P = .001). Two-year OS rates were higher with azacitidine versus CCR in patients considered unfit for IC (P = .0003). Azacitidine was associated with fewer total days in hospital (P < .0001) than CCR.

"Phase III, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) in Patients With Lower-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes. Treatment options are limited for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS). This phase III, placebo-controlled trial evaluated CC-486 (oral azacitidine), a hypomethylating agent, in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System LR-MDS and RBC transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to CC-486 300-mg or placebo for 21 days/28-day cycle. The primary end point was RBC transfusion independence (TI). Two hundred sixteen patients received CC-486 (n = 107) or placebo (n = 109). The median age was 74 years, median platelet count was 25 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and absolute neutrophil count was 1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. In the CC-486 and placebo arms, 31% and 11% of patients, respectively, achieved RBC-TI (<i>P</i> = .0002), with median durations of 11.1 and 5.0 months. Reductions of ≥ 4 RBC units were attained by 42.1% and 30.6% of patients, respectively, with median durations of 10.0 and 2.3 months, and more CC-486 patients had ≥ 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increases from baseline (23.4% <i>v</i> 4.6%). Platelet hematologic improvement rate was higher with CC-486 (24.3% <i>v</i> 6.5%). Underpowered interim overall survival analysis showed no difference between CC-486 and placebo (median, 17.3 <i>v</i> 16.2 months; <i>P</i> = .96). Low-grade GI events were the most common adverse events in both arms. In the CC-486 and placebo arms, 90% and 73% of patients experienced a grade 3-4 adverse event. Overall death rate was similar between arms, but there was an imbalance in deaths during the first 56 days (CC-486, n = 16; placebo, n = 6), most related to infections; the median pretreatment absolute neutrophil count for the 16 CC-486 patients was 0.57 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. CC-486 significantly improved RBC-TI rate and induced durable bilineage improvements in patients with LR-MDS and high-risk disease features. More early deaths occurred in the CC-486 arm, most related to infections in patients with significant pretreatment neutropenia.

"Randomized Phase III Study of Enzalutamide Compared With Enzalutamide Plus Abiraterone for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (Alliance A031201 Trial). Enzalutamide and abiraterone both target androgen receptor signaling but via different mechanisms. The mechanism of action of one drug may counteract the resistance pathways of the other. We sought to determine whether the addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AAP) to enzalutamide prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the first-line setting. Men with untreated mCRPC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive first-line enzalutamide with or without AAP. The primary end point was OS. Toxicity, prostate-specific antigen declines, pharmacokinetics, and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were also examined. Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and the stratified log-rank statistic were used to compare OS between treatments. In total, 1,311 patients were randomly assigned: 657 to enzalutamide and 654 to enzalutamide plus AAP. OS was not statistically different between the two arms (median, 32.7 [95% CI, 30.5 to 35.4] months for enzalutamide <i>v</i> 34.2 [95% CI, 31.4 to 37.3] months for enzalutamide and AAP; hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; one-sided <i>P</i> = .03; boundary nominal significance level = .02). rPFS was longer in the combination arm (median rPFS, 21.3 [95% CI, 19.4 to 22.9] months for enzalutamide <i>v</i> 24.3 [95% CI, 22.3 to 26.7] months for enzalutamide and AAP; HR, 0.86; two-sided <i>P</i> = .02). However, pharmacokinetic clearance of abiraterone was 2.2- to 2.9-fold higher when administered with enzalutamide, compared with clearance values for abiraterone alone. The addition of AAP to enzalutamide for first-line treatment of mCRPC was not associated with a statistically significant benefit in OS. Drug-drug interactions between the two agents resulting in increased abiraterone clearance may partly account for this result, although these interactions did not prevent the combination regimen from having more nonhematologic toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36996380/,36996380,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy compared to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide when used to treat Prostate cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy versus Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy and Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy versus Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy when compared with Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for Prostate cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy in comparison to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy compared to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for addressing Prostate cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy and Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in the treatment of Prostate cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy against Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for managing Prostate cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy compared to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in treating Prostate cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy contrasted with Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in relation to Prostate cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy versus Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for treating Prostate cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy and Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in treating Prostate cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy as opposed to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in managing Prostate cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy compared to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in the context of Prostate cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Enzalutamide monotherapy compares to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in terms of effectiveness for Prostate cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy in relation to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Enzalutamide monotherapy versus Abiraterone and Enzalutamide for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Enzalutamide monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in treating Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Enzalutamide monotherapy against Abiraterone and Enzalutamide regarding Prostate cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01949337,"{""36996380"": ""Michael J Morris|Glenn Heller|David W Hillman|Olivia Bobek|Charles Ryan|Emmanuel S Antonarakis|Alan H Bryce|Olwen Hahn|Himisha Beltran|Andrew J Armstrong|Lawrence Schwartz|Lionel D Lewis|Jan H Beumer|Brooke Langevin|Eric C McGary|Paul T Mehan|Amir Goldkorn|Bruce J Roth|Han Xiao|Colleen Watt|Mary-Ellen Taplin|Susan Halabi|Eric J Small""}",2014-01-22,Yes,Yes,Oral,Corticosteroids
"Rilotumumab in combination with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine as first-line treatment for gastric or oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma: an open-label, dose de-escalation phase 1b study and a double-blind, randomised phase 2 study. Dysregulation of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET pathway promotes tumour growth and metastasis. Rilotumumab is a fully human, monoclonal antibody that neutralises HGF. We aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, biomarkers, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX) in patients with advanced gastric or oesophagogastric junction cancer. We recruited patients (≥18 years old) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, who had not received previous systemic therapy, from 43 sites worldwide. Phase 1b was an open-label, dose de-escalation study to identify a safe dose of rilotumumab (initial dose 15 mg/kg intravenously on day 1) plus ECX (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, capecitabine 625 mg/m(2) twice a day orally on days 1-21, respectively), administered every 3 weeks. The phase 1b primary endpoint was the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities in all phase 1b patients who received at least one dose of rilotumumab and completed the dose-limiting toxicity assessment window (first cycle of therapy). Phase 2 was a double-blind study that randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) using an interactive voice response system to receive rilotumumab 15 mg/kg, rilotumumab 7·5 mg/kg, or placebo, plus ECX (doses as above), stratified by ECOG performance status and disease extent. The phase 2 primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), analysed by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00719550. Seven of the nine patients enrolled in the phase 1b study received at least one dose of rilotumumab 15 mg/kg, only two of whom had three dose-limiting toxicities: palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, cerebral ischaemia, and deep-vein thrombosis. In phase 2, 121 patients were randomly assigned (40 to rilotumumab 15 mg/kg; 42 to rilotumumab 7·5 mg/kg; 39 to placebo). Median PFS was 5·1 months (95% CI 2·9-7·0) in the rilotumumab 15 mg/kg group, 6·8 months (4·5-7·5) in the rilotumumab 7·5 mg/kg group, 5·7 months (4·5-7·0) in both rilotumumab groups combined, and 4·2 months (2·9-4·9) in the placebo group. The hazard ratio for PFS events compared with placebo was 0·69 (80% CI 0·49-0·97; p=0·164) for rilotumumab 15 mg/kg, 0·53 (80% CI 0·38-0·73; p=0·009) for rilotumumab 7·5 mg/kg, and 0·60 (80% CI 0·45-0·79; p=0·016) for combined rilotumumab. Any grade adverse events more common in the combined rilotumumab group than in the placebo group included haematological adverse events (neutropenia in 44 [54%] of 81 patients vs 13 [33%] of 39 patients; anaemia in 32 [40%] vs 11 [28%]; and thrombocytopenia in nine [11%] vs none), peripheral oedema (22 [27%] vs three [8%]), and venous thromboembolism (16 [20%] vs five [13%]). Grade 3-4 adverse events more common with rilotumumab included neutropenia (36 [44%] vs 11 [28%]) and venous thromboembolism (16 [20%] vs four [10%]). Serious adverse events were balanced between groups except for anaemia, which occurred more frequently in the combined rilotumumab group (ten [12%] vs none). Rilotumumab plus ECX had no unexpected safety signals and showed greater activity than placebo plus ECX.

"Effect of Blinatumomab vs Chemotherapy on Event-Free Survival Among Children With High-risk First-Relapse B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Blinatumomab is a CD3/CD19-directed bispecific T-cell engager molecule with efficacy in children with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). To evaluate event-free survival in children with high-risk first-relapse B-ALL after a third consolidation course with blinatumomab vs consolidation chemotherapy before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In this randomized phase 3 clinical trial, patients were enrolled November 2015 to July 2019 (data cutoff, July 17, 2019). Investigators at 47 centers in 13 countries enrolled children older than 28 days and younger than 18 years with high-risk first-relapse B-ALL in morphologic complete remission (M1 marrow, <5% blasts) or with M2 marrow (blasts ≥5% and <25%) at randomization. Patients were randomized to receive 1 cycle of blinatumomab (n = 54; 15 μg/m2/d for 4 weeks, continuous intravenous infusion) or chemotherapy (n = 54) for the third consolidation. The primary end point was event-free survival (events: relapse, death, second malignancy, or failure to achieve complete remission). The key secondary efficacy end point was overall survival. Other secondary end points included minimal residual disease remission and incidence of adverse events. A total of 108 patients were randomized (median age, 5.0 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 4.0-10.5]; 51.9% girls; 97.2% M1 marrow) and all patients were included in the analysis. Enrollment was terminated early for benefit of blinatumomab in accordance with a prespecified stopping rule. After a median of 22.4 months of follow-up (IQR, 8.1-34.2), the incidence of events in the blinatumomab vs consolidation chemotherapy groups was 31% vs 57% (log-rank P < .001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.33 [95% CI, 0.18-0.61]). Deaths occurred in 8 patients (14.8%) in the blinatumomab group and 16 (29.6%) in the consolidation chemotherapy group. The overall survival HR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.18-1.01). Minimal residual disease remission was observed in more patients in the blinatumomab vs consolidation chemotherapy group (90% [44/49] vs 54% [26/48]; difference, 35.6% [95% CI, 15.6%-52.5%]). No fatal adverse events were reported. In the blinatumomab vs consolidation chemotherapy group, the incidence of serious adverse events was 24.1% vs 43.1%, respectively, and the incidence of adverse events greater than or equal to grade 3 was 57.4% vs 82.4%. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 2 patients in the blinatumomab group. Among children with high-risk first-relapse B-ALL, treatment with 1 cycle of blinatumomab compared with standard intensive multidrug chemotherapy before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant resulted in an improved event-free survival at a median of 22.4 months of follow-up.

"Autologous stem cell transplantation as a first-line treatment strategy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial from the SFGM-TC and GFLLC. Long-term responses have been reported after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of ASCT in previously untreated CLL patients. We enrolled 241 patients < 66 years of age with Binet stage B or C CLL. They received 3 courses of mini-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone/prednisolone) and then 3 courses of fludarabine. Patients in complete response (CR) were then randomized to ASCT or observation, whereas the other patients were randomized to dexamethasone, high-dose aracytin, cisplatin (DHAP) salvage followed by either ASCT or 3 courses of fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC). The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS). After up-front treatment, 105 patients entered CR and were randomized between ASCT (n = 52) and observation (n = 53); their respective 3-year EFS rates were 79.8% and 35.5%; the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1-0.7; P = .003). Ninety-four patients who did not enter CR were randomized between ASCT (n = 46) and FC (n = 48); their respective 3-year EFS rates were 48.9% and 44.4%, respectively; the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.9-3.2; P = .13).

"Randomized double-blind clinical trial comparing safety and efficacy of the biosimilar BCD-021 with reference bevacizumab. BCD-021 is a bevacizumab biosimilar which was shown to be equivalent to reference bevacizumab in a wide panel of physicochemical studies as well as preclinical studies in vitro and in vivo. International multicenter phase III clinical trial was conducted to compare efficacy and safety of BCD-021 and reference bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in a first-line treatment of inoperable or advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with no previous treatment for advanced non-squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned 3:2 to BCD-021 or reference bevacizumab and were treated with bevacizumab + paclitaxel + carboplatin. Therapy continued for 6 cycles (every 3 weeks), until progression of the disease or unbearable toxicity. The primary study endpoint was the overall response rate. The study goal was to prove the equivalent efficacy of BCD-021 and reference bevacizumab. Equivalence margins for 95% CI for the difference in the overall response rates were set at [-18%; 18%], for 90% CI for the ratio of overall response rate were set at [67%; 150%]. In total 357 patients were enrolled in the study, 212 in the BCD-021 group and 145 in the reference bevacizumab group. The ORR was 34.63% in the BCD-022 group and 33.82% in the reference bevacizumab group. Limits of 95% CI for the difference in overall response rates between the groups were [-9.47%; 11.09%]. Limits of 90% CI for the ratio of overall response rate between the groups were [79.6%; 131.73%]. For both approaches CI lied within predetermined equivalence margins. Profile of adverse events (AEs) was similar between the groups (any AEs were reported in 86.89% of patients in BCD-021 group and 89.05% of patients in reference group). No unexpected adverse reactions were reported throughout the study. No statistically significant differences regarding anti-drug antibody occurrence rate was found between BCD-022 (n=4; 1.96%) and comparator (n=5; 3.65%).

In this randomized, open-label, phase II study, we characterized the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (CPB) in patients with previously untreated advanced MM. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive carboplatin (area under the curve, 5) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) once every 4 weeks in combination with (CPB arm, 5 mg/kg) or without (CP arm) bevacizumab once every 2 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and adverse events. We recruited 114 patients to our study. The median PFS was significantly longer in the CPB arm (4.8 months; 95% CI, 3.6 to 6.0 months) than in the CP arm (3.0 months; 95% CI, 1.7 to 4.3 months) (hazard ratio, 0.461; 95% CI, 0.306 to 0.695; <i>P</i> < .001).

"Adjuvant trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab improves survival in the adjuvant treatment of HER-positive breast cancer, although combined therapy with anthracycline-based regimens has been associated with cardiac toxicity. We wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new nonanthracycline regimen with trastuzumab. We randomly assigned 3222 women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel every 3 weeks (AC-T), the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (AC-T plus trastuzumab), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (TCH). The primary study end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival and safety. At a median follow-up of 65 months, 656 events triggered this protocol-specified analysis. The estimated disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 75% among patients receiving AC-T, 84% among those receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab, and 81% among those receiving TCH. Estimated rates of overall survival were 87%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. No significant differences in efficacy (disease-free or overall survival) were found between the two trastuzumab regimens, whereas both were superior to AC-T. The rates of congestive heart failure and cardiac dysfunction were significantly higher in the group receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab than in the TCH group (P<0.001). Eight cases of acute leukemia were reported: seven in the groups receiving the anthracycline-based regimens and one in the TCH group subsequent to receiving an anthracycline outside the study. The addition of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improved disease-free and overall survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer. The risk-benefit ratio favored the nonanthracycline TCH regimen over AC-T plus trastuzumab, given its similar efficacy, fewer acute toxic effects, and lower risks of cardiotoxicity and leukemia.

"Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) versus treatment of physician's choice in women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine (BEACON): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial. New options are needed for patients with heavily pretreated breast cancer. Etirinotecan pegol is a long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor that prolongs exposure to, but reduces the toxicity of, SN38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan). We assessed whether etirinotecan pegol is superior to currently available treatments for patients with previously treated, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. In this open-label, multicentre, randomised phase 3 study (BEACON; BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), conducted at 135 sites in 11 countries, patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine (and two to five previous regimens for advanced disease) were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally via an interactive response system to etirinotecan pegol (145 mg/m(2) as a 90-min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) or single-drug treatment of physician's choice. Patients with stable brain metastases and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were eligible. Randomisation was stratified with a permuted block scheme by region, previous eribulin, and receptor status. After randomisation, patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01492101. Between Dec 19, 2011, and Aug 20, 2013, 852 patients were randomly assigned; 429 to etirinotecan pegol and 423 to treatment of physician's choice. There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups (median 12·4 months [95% CI 11·0-13·6] for the etirinotecan pegol group vs 10·3 months [9·0-11·3] for the treatment of physician's choice group; hazard ratio 0·87 [95% CI 0·75-1·02]; p=0·084). The safety population includes the 831 patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment (425 assigned to etirinotecan pegol and 406 to treatment of physician's choice). Serious adverse events were recorded for 128 (30%) patients treated with etirinotecan pegol and 129 (32%) treated with treatment of physician's choice. Fewer patients in the etirinotecan pegol group had grade 3 or worse toxicity than those in the treatment of physician's choice group (204 [48%] vs 256 [63%]; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (41 [10%] in the experimental group vs five [1%] in the control group), neutropenia (41 [10%] vs 125 [31%]), and peripheral neuropathy (two [<1%] vs 15 [4%]). Three patients in the etirinotecan pegol group died of treatment-related adverse events (pneumonia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute renal failure) and two in the treatment of physician's choice group (neutropenic sepsis and septic shock). This trial did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival for etirinotecan pegol compared to treatment of physician's choice in patients with heavily pre-treated advanced breast cancer. The toxicity profile noted in the etirinotecan pegol group differed from that in the control group. In view of the frequency of cross-resistance and overlapping toxicities noted with many available drugs and the need for effective drugs in highly refractory disease, etirinotecan pegol may warrant further research in some subgroups of patients.

"Continuation or reintroduction of bevacizumab beyond progression to first-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer: final results of the randomized BEBYP trial. The combination of bevacizumab with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is a standard first-line treatment option in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We studied the efficacy of continuing or reintroducing bevacizumab in combination with second-line chemotherapy after progression to bevacizumab-based first-line therapy. In this phase III study, patients with mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were randomized to receive in second-line mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI (depending on first-line regimen) with or without bevacizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. To detect a hazard ratio (HR) for progression of 0.70 with an α and β error of 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, 262 patients were required. In consideration of the results of the ML18147 trial, the study was prematurely stopped. Between April 2008 and May 2012, a total of 185 patients were randomized. Bevacizumab-free interval was longer than 3 months in 43% of patients in chemotherapy alone arm and in 50% of patients in the bevacizumab arm. At a median follow-up of 45.3 months, the median progression-free survival was 5.0 months in the chemotherapy group and 6.8 months in the bevacizumab group [adjusted HR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank P = 0.010]. Subgroup analyses showed a consistent benefit in all subgroups analyzed and in particular in patients who had continued or reintroduced bevacizumab. An improved overall survival was also observed in the bevacizumab arm (adjusted HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.56-1.06; stratified log-rank P = 0.043). Responses (RECIST 1.0) were similar in the chemotherapy and bevacizumab groups (17% and 21%; P = 0.573). Toxicity profile was consistent with previously reported data. This study demonstrates that the continuation or the reintroduction of bevacizumab with second-line chemotherapy beyond first progression improves the outcome and supports the use of this strategy in the treatment of mCRC.

"A Phase 3 Trial of Luspatercept in Patients with Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia. Patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia need regular red-cell transfusions. Luspatercept, a recombinant fusion protein that binds to select transforming growth factor β superfamily ligands, may enhance erythroid maturation and reduce the transfusion burden (the total number of red-cell units transfused) in such patients. In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, adults with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia to receive best supportive care plus luspatercept (at a dose of 1.00 to 1.25 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for at least 48 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who had a reduction in the transfusion burden of at least 33% from baseline during weeks 13 through 24 plus a reduction of at least 2 red-cell units over this 12-week interval. Other efficacy end points included reductions in the transfusion burden during any 12-week interval and results of iron studies. A total of 224 patients were assigned to the luspatercept group and 112 to the placebo group. Luspatercept or placebo was administered for a median of approximately 64 weeks in both groups. The percentage of patients who had a reduction in the transfusion burden of at least 33% from baseline during weeks 13 through 24 plus a reduction of at least 2 red-cell units over this 12-week interval was significantly greater in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group (21.4% vs. 4.5%, P<0.001). During any 12-week interval, the percentage of patients who had a reduction in transfusion burden of at least 33% was greater in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group (70.5% vs. 29.5%), as was the percentage of those who had a reduction of at least 50% (40.2% vs. 6.3%). The least-squares mean difference between the groups in serum ferritin levels at week 48 was -348 μg per liter (95% confidence interval, -517 to -179) in favor of luspatercept.

"Venetoclax or placebo in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (BELLINI): a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial. Venetoclax is a highly selective, potent, oral BCL-2 inhibitor, which induces apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. Venetoclax plus bortezomib and dexamethasone has shown encouraging clinical efficacy with acceptable safety and tolerability in a phase 1 trial. The aim of this study was to evaluate venetoclax plus bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial, patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, who had received one to three previous therapies were enrolled from 90 hospitals in 16 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) centrally using an interactive response technology system and a block size of three to receive venetoclax (800 mg per day orally) or placebo with bortezomib (1·3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously or intravenously and dexamethasone (20 mg orally). Treatment was given in 21-day cycles for the first eight cycles and 35-day cycles from the ninth cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Randomisation was stratified by previous exposure to a proteasome inhibitor and the number of previous therapies. Sponsors, investigators, study site personnel, and patients were masked to the treatment allocation throughout the study. The primary endpoint was independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02755597. Between July 19, 2016, and Oct 31, 2017, 291 patients were randomly assigned to receive venetoclax (n=194) or placebo (n=97). With a median follow-up of 18·7 months (IQR 16·6-21·0), median progression-free survival according to independent review committee was 22·4 months (95% CI 15·3-not estimable) with venetoclax versus 11·5 months (9·6-15·0) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·63 [95% CI 0·44-0·90]; p=0·010). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (35 [18%] of 193 patients in the venetoclax group vs seven [7%] of 96 patients in the placebo group), pneumonia (30 [16%] vs nine [9%]), thrombocytopenia (28 [15%] vs 29 [30%]), anaemia (28 [15%] vs 14 [15%]), and diarrhoea (28 [15%] vs 11 [11%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 93 (48%) patients in the venetoclax group and 48 (50%) patients in the placebo group, with eight (4%) treatment-emergent fatal infections reported in the venetoclax group and none reported in the placebo group. Three deaths in the venetoclax group (two from pneumonia and one from septic shock) were considered treatment-related; no deaths in the placebo group were treatment-related. The primary endpoint was met with a significant improvement in independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival with venetoclax versus placebo plus bortezomib and dexamethasone. However, increased mortality was seen in the venetoclax group, mostly because of an increased rate of infections, highlighting the importance of appropriate selection of patients for this treatment option.

"Buparlisib and paclitaxel in patients with platinum-pretreated recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (BERIL-1): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck contributes to treatment resistance and disease progression. Buparlisib, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, has shown preclinical antitumour activity and objective responses in patients with epithelial malignancies. We assessed whether the addition of buparlisib to paclitaxel improves clinical outcomes compared with paclitaxel and placebo in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study (BERIL-1), we recruited patients aged 18 years and older with histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after disease progression on or after one previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting. Eligible patients were enrolled from 58 centres across 18 countries and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive second-line oral buparlisib (100 mg once daily) or placebo, plus intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in 28 day treatment cycles. Randomisation was done via a central patient screening and randomisation system with an interactive (voice and web) response system and stratification by number of previous lines of therapy in the recurrent and metastatic setting and study site. Patients and investigators (including local radiologists) were masked to treatment assignment from randomisation until the final overall survival analysis. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by local investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (version 1.1) in all randomly assigned patients. Efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population, whereas safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment according to the treatment they received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01852292, and is ongoing but no longer enrolling patients. Between Nov 5, 2013, and May 5, 2015, 158 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either buparlisib plus paclitaxel (n=79) or placebo plus paclitaxel (n=79). Median progression-free survival was 4·6 months (95% CI 3·5-5·3) in the buparlisib group and 3·5 months (2·2-3·7) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·65 [95% CI 0·45-0·95], nominal one-sided p=0·011). Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 62 (82%) of 76 patients in the buparlisib group and 56 (72%) of 78 patients in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events (occurring in ≥10% of patients in the buparlisib group vs the placebo group) were hyperglycaemia (17 [22%] of 76 vs two [3%] of 78), anaemia (14 [18%] vs nine [12%]), neutropenia (13 [17%] vs four [5%]), and fatigue (six [8%] vs eight [10%]). Serious adverse events (regardless of relation to study treatment) were reported for 43 (57%) of 76 patients in the buparlisib group and 37 (47%) of 78 in the placebo group. On-treatment deaths occurred in 15 (20%) of 76 patients in the buparlisib group and 17 (22%) of 78 patients in the placebo group; most were caused by disease progression and none were judged to be related to study treatment. On the basis of the improved clinical efficacy with a manageable safety profile, the results of this randomised phase 2 study suggest that buparlisib in combination with paclitaxel could be an effective second-line treatment for patients with platinum-pretreated recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Further phase 3 studies are warranted to confirm this phase 2 finding.

"Efficacy and Safety of Proposed Bevacizumab Biosimilar BE1040V in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Phase III, Randomized, Double-blind, Noninferiority Clinical Trial. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a proposed bevacizumab biosimilar to those of the reference product in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind (patient- and assessor-blind), active-controlled, 2-armed, parallel-group, noninferiority trial was conducted in patients with histologically verified colorectal cancer with evidence of at least 1 metastasis. Patients with mCRC were randomized 2:1 to receive 5 mg/kg IV of either study drug plus FOLFIRI-3 (with repeated irinotecan 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> 60-min infusion on day 3) or the reference drug plus FOLFIRI-3 every 2 weeks for 1 year. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point, and overall survival, objective response rate, and time to treatment failure as well as safety and immunogenicity were secondary end points. The population assessable for PFS was per protocol, and the intention-to-treat population was used for sensitivity analysis. Safety was assessed based on reports of adverse events, laboratory test results, and vital sign measurements. A total of 126 patients were enrolled; PFS values in the biosimilar and reference arms were 232 days (7.7 months) and 210 days (7 months), respectively (P = 0.47). The hazard ratio of the biosimilar arm versus the reference arm was 0.79 in the per-protocol population (90% CI, 0.46-1.35; P = 0.47). The upper limit for the 2-sided 90% CI was lower than the margin of 1.44, indicating that the biosimilar drug was noninferior to the reference drug. The hazard ratio for overall survival in the intent-to-treat population was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.55-1.80; P = 0.99). The difference between other efficacy end points among the groups was not statistically significant. No significant difference was observed in the comparison of the two arms for safety. The antidrug antibody was positive in 1 patient in each arm. The proposed biosimilar BE1040V was noninferior to the reference product in terms of efficacy in the treatment of mCRC, and tolerability was comparable between the 2 drugs.

"BEYOND: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter, Phase III Study of First-Line Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Plus Bevacizumab or Placebo in Chinese Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. The phase III BEYOND trial was undertaken to confirm in a Chinese patient population the efficacy seen with first-line bevacizumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy in globally conducted studies. Patients age ≥ 18 years with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin (area under the curve, 6) intravenously and paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) intravenously (CP) on day 1 of each 3-week cycle, for ≤ six cycles, plus placebo (Pl+CP) or bevacizumab (B+CP) 15 mg/kg intravenously, on day 1 of each cycle, until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were objective response rate, overall survival, exploratory biomarkers, safety. A total of 276 patients were randomly assigned, 138 to each arm. PFS was prolonged with B+CP versus Pl+CP (median, 9.2 v 6.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.54; P < .001).

This randomized, phase 2 trial in AML patients not considered suitable for intensive induction therapy compared low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) with or without volasertib, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of polo-like kinases. Eighty-seven patients (median age 75 years) received LDAC 20 mg twice daily subcutaneously days 1-10 or LDAC + volasertib 350 mg IV days 1 + 15 every 4 weeks. Response rate (complete remission and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) was higher for LDAC + volasertib vs LDAC (31.0% vs 13.3%; odds ratio, 2.91; P = .052). Responses in the LDAC + volasertib arm were observed across all genetic groups, including 5 of 14 patients with adverse cytogenetics. Median event-free survival was significantly prolonged by LDAC + volasertib compared with LDAC (5.6 vs 2.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.92; P = .021); median overall survival was 8.0 vs 5.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-1.00; P = .047). LDAC + volasertib led to an increased frequency of adverse events that was most pronounced for neutropenic fever/infections and gastrointestinal events; there was no increase in the death rate at days 60 + 90.

"Myeloablative Versus Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes. Purpose The optimal regimen intensity before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. We hypothesized that lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) would result in improved overall survival (OS) compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC). To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing MAC with RIC in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 65 years with HCT comorbidity index ≤ 4 and < 5% marrow myeloblasts pre-HCT were randomly assigned to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137) followed by HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. The primary end point was OS 18 months post-random assignment based on an intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival (RFS) and TRM. Results Planned enrollment was 356 patients; accrual ceased at 272 because of high relapse incidence with RIC versus MAC (48.3%; 95% CI, 39.6% to 56.4% and 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.3% to 19.8%, respectively; P < .001). At 18 months, OS for patients in the RIC arm was 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1% to 74.9%) versus 77.5% (95% CI, 69.4% to 83.7%) for those in the MAC arm (difference, 9.8%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 20.3%; P = .07). TRM with RIC was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.8% to 8.9%) versus 15.8% (95% CI, 10.2% to 22.5%) with MAC ( P = .002). RFS with RIC was 47.3% (95% CI, 38.7% to 55.4%) versus 67.8% (95% CI, 59.1% to 75%) with MAC ( P < .01). Conclusion OS was higher with MAC, but this was not statistically significant. RIC resulted in lower TRM but higher relapse rates compared with MAC, with a statistically significant advantage in RFS with MAC. These data support the use of MAC as the standard of care for fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28380315/,28380315,"Choose an

"Once-per-week selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone versus twice-per-week bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma (BOSTON): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Selinexor combined with dexamethasone has shown activity in patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. In a phase 1b/2 study, the combination of oral selinexor with bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) and dexamethasone induced high response rates with low rates of peripheral neuropathy, the main dose-limiting toxicity of bortezomib. We aimed to evaluate the clinical benefit of weekly selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone versus standard bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. This phase 3, randomised, open-label trial was done at 123 sites in 21 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, who had multiple myeloma, and who had previously been treated with one to three lines of therapy, including proteasome inhibitors, were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive selinexor (100 mg once per week), bortezomib (1·3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once per week), and dexamethasone (20 mg twice per week), or bortezomib (1·3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice per week for the first 24 weeks and once per week thereafter) and dexamethasone (20 mg four times per week for the first 24 weeks and twice per week thereafter). Randomisation was done using interactive response technology and stratified by previous proteasome inhibitor therapy, lines of treatment, and multiple myeloma stage. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Patients who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the safety population. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03110562. The trial is ongoing, with 55 patients remaining on randomised therapy as of Feb 20, 2020. Of 457 patients screened for eligibility, 402 were randomly allocated-195 (49%) to the selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone group and 207 (51%) to the bortezomib and dexamethasone group-and the first dose of study medication was given between June 6, 2017, and Feb 5, 2019. Median follow-up durations were 13·2 months [IQR 6·2-19·8] for the selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone group and 16·5 months [9·4-19·8] for the bortezomib and dexamethasone group. Median progression-free survival was 13·93 months (95% CI 11·73-not evaluable) with selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and 9·46 months (8·11-10·78) with bortezomib and dexamethasone (hazard ratio 0·70 [95% CI 0·53-0·93], p=0·0075). The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (77 [39%] of 195 patients in the selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone group vs 35 [17%] of 204 in the bortezomib and dexamethasone group), fatigue (26 [13%] vs two [1%]), anaemia (31 [16%] vs 20 [10%]), and pneumonia (22 [11%] vs 22 [11%]). Peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or above was less frequent with selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (41 [21%] patients) than with bortezomib and dexamethasone (70 [34%] patients; odds ratio 0·50 [95% CI 0·32-0·79], p=0·0013). 47 (24%) patients in the selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone group and 62 (30%) in the bortezomib and dexamethasone group died. A once-per-week regimen of selinexor, bortezomib, and dexamethasone is a novel, effective, and convenient treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three previous lines of therapy.

BREACH is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase II trial. Eligible patients were age 18-60 years with ≥ 1 unfavorable EORTC/LYSA criterion. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to four cycles of BV-AVD or standard doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), followed by 30 Gy involved node radiotherapy. The primary end point was the positron emission tomography (PET) response rate after two cycles by expert independent review using the Deauville score. The study was designed to test if the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD was superior to 75%. We hypothesized a 10% increase in the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD. Between March 2015 and October 2016, 170 patients were enrolled. After two cycles, the primary end point of the study was met: 93 (82.3%; 90% CI, 75.3 to 88.0) of 113 patients in the BV-AVD arm were PET-negative (Deauville score 1-3) compared with 43 (75.4%; 90% CI, 64.3% to 84.5%) of 57 in the ABVD arm.

"Adjuvant vemurafenib in resected, BRAF<sup>V600</sup> mutation-positive melanoma (BRIM8): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 3 trial. Systemic adjuvant treatment might mitigate the high risk of disease recurrence in patients with resected stage IIC-III melanoma. The BRIM8 study evaluated adjuvant vemurafenib monotherapy in patients with resected, BRAF<sup>V600</sup> mutation-positive melanoma. BRIM8 was a phase 3, international, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 498 adults (aged ≥18 years) with histologically confirmed stage IIC-IIIA-IIIB (cohort 1) or stage IIIC (cohort 2) BRAF<sup>V600</sup> mutation-positive melanoma that was fully resected. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice or web response system to receive twice-daily adjuvant oral vemurafenib 960 mg tablets or matching placebo for 52 weeks (13 × 28-day cycles). Randomisation was done by permuted blocks (block size 6) and was stratified by pathological stage and region in cohort 1 and by region in cohort 2. The investigators, patients, and sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, evaluated separately in each cohort. Hierarchical analysis of cohort 2 before cohort 1 was prespecified. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01667419. The study enrolled 184 patients in cohort 2 (93 were assigned to vemurafenib and 91 to placebo) and 314 patients in cohort 1 (157 were assigned to vemurafenib and 157 to placebo). At the time of data cutoff (April 17, 2017), median study follow-up was 33·5 months (IQR 25·9-41·6) in cohort 2 and 30·8 months (25·5-40·7) in cohort 1. In cohort 2 (patients with stage IIIC disease), median disease-free survival was 23·1 months (95% CI 18·6-26·5) in the vemurafenib group versus 15·4 months (11·1-35·9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·80, 95% CI 0·54-1·18; log-rank p=0·26). In cohort 1 (patients with stage IIC-IIIA-IIIB disease) median disease-free survival was not reached (95% CI not estimable) in the vemurafenib group versus 36·9 months (21·4-not estimable) in the placebo group (HR 0·54 [95% CI 0·37-0·78]; log-rank p=0·0010); however, the result was not significant because of the prespecified hierarchical prerequisite for the primary disease-free survival analysis of cohort 2 to show a significant disease-free survival benefit. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 141 (57%) of 247 patients in the vemurafenib group and 37 (15%) of 247 patients in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the vemurafenib group were keratoacanthoma (24 [10%] of 247 patients), arthralgia (17 [7%]), squamous cell carcinoma (17 [7%]), rash (14 [6%]), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (14 [6%]), although all keratoacanthoma events and most squamous cell carcinoma events were by default graded as grade 3. In the placebo group, grade 3-4 adverse events did not exceed 2% for any of the reported terms. Serious adverse events were reported in 40 (16%) of 247 patients in the vemurafenib group and 25 (10%) of 247 patients in the placebo group. The most common serious adverse event was basal cell carcinoma, which was reported in eight (3%) patients in each group. One patient in the vemurafenib group of cohort 2 died 2 months after admission to hospital for grade 3 hypertension; however, this death was not considered to be related to the study drug. The primary endpoint of disease-free survival was not met in cohort 2, and therefore the analysis of cohort 1 showing a numerical benefit in disease-free survival with vemurafenib versus placebo in patients with resected stage IIC-IIIA-IIIB BRAF<sup>V600</sup> mutation-positive melanoma must be considered exploratory only. 1 year of adjuvant vemurafenib was well tolerated, but might not be an optimal treatment regimen in this patient population.

"Vaccination with patient-specific tumor-derived antigen in first remission improves disease-free survival in follicular lymphoma. Vaccination with hybridoma-derived autologous tumor immunoglobulin (Ig) idiotype (Id) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and administered with granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces follicular lymphoma (FL) -specific immune responses. To determine the clinical benefit of this vaccine, we conducted a double-blind multicenter controlled phase III trial. Treatment-naive patients with advanced stage FL achieving complete response (CR) or CR unconfirmed (CRu) after chemotherapy were randomly assigned two to one to receive either Id vaccine (Id-KLH + GM-CSF) or control (KLH + GM-CSF). Primary efficacy end points were disease-free survival (DFS) for all randomly assigned patients and DFS for randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of Id vaccine or control. Of 234 patients enrolled, 177 (81%) achieved CR/CRu after chemotherapy and were randomly assigned. For 177 randomly assigned patients, including 60 patients not vaccinated because of relapse (n = 55) or other reasons (n = 5), median DFS between Id-vaccine and control arms was 23.0 versus 20.6 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.16; P = .256). For 117 patients who received Id vaccine (n = 76) or control (n = 41), median DFS after randomization was 44.2 months for Id-vaccine arm versus 30.6 months for control arm (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.99; P = .047) at median follow-up of 56.6 months (range, 12.6 to 89.3 months). In an unplanned subgroup analysis, median DFS was significantly prolonged for patients receiving IgM-Id (52.9 v 28.7 months; P = .001) but not IgG-Id vaccine (35.1 v 32.4 months; P = .807) compared with isotype-matched control-treated patients. Vaccination with patient-specific hybridoma-derived Id vaccine after chemotherapy-induced CR/CRu may prolong DFS in patients with FL.

"Arsenic trioxide improves event-free and overall survival for adults with acute promyelocytic leukemia: North American Leukemia Intergroup Study C9710. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is a highly effective treatment for patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); its role as consolidation treatment for patients in first remission has not been defined. We randomized 481 patients (age ≥ 15 years) with untreated APL to either a standard induction regimen of tretinoin, cytarabine, and daunorubicin, followed by 2 courses of consolidation therapy with tretinoin plus daunorubicin, or to the same induction and consolidation regimen plus two 25-day courses of As(2)O(3) consolidation immediately after induction. After consolidation, patients were randomly assigned to one year of maintenance therapy with either tretinoin alone or in combination with methotrexate and mercaptopurine. Ninety percent of patients on each arm achieved remission and were eligible to receive their assigned consolidation therapy. Event-free survival, the primary end point, was significantly better for patients assigned to receive As(2)O(3) consolidation, 80% compared with 63% at 3 years (stratified log-rank test, P < .0001). Survival, a secondary end point, was better in the As(2)O(3) arm, 86% compared with 81% at 3 years (P = .059). Disease-free survival, a secondary end point, was significantly better in the As(2)O(3) arm, 90% compared with 70% at 3 years (P < .0001).

"Phase III trial of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel compared with polyethylated castor oil-based paclitaxel in women with breast cancer. ABI-007, the first biologically interactive albumin-bound paclitaxel in a nanameter particle, free of solvents, was compared with polyethylated castor oil-based standard paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III study was performed to confirm preclinical studies demonstrating superior efficacy and reduced toxicity of ABI-007 compared with standard paclitaxel. Patients were randomly assigned to 3-week cycles of either ABI-007 260 mg/m(2) intravenously without premedication (n = 229) or standard paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) intravenously with premedication (n = 225). ABI-007 demonstrated significantly higher response rates compared with standard paclitaxel (33% v 19%, respectively; P = .001) and significantly longer time to tumor progression (23.0 v 16.9 weeks, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.75; P = .006). The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia was significantly lower for ABI-007 compared with standard paclitaxel (9% v 22%, respectively; P < .001) despite a 49% higher paclitaxel dose. Febrile neutropenia was uncommon (< 2%), and the incidence did not differ between the two study arms. Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was more common in the ABI-007 arm than in the standard paclitaxel arm (10% v 2%, respectively; P < .001) but was easily managed and improved rapidly (median, 22 days). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred with ABI-007 despite the absence of premedication and shorter administration time. ABI-007 demonstrated greater efficacy and a favorable safety profile compared with standard paclitaxel in this patient population.

"Weekly nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin versus solvent-based paclitaxel plus carboplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: final results of a phase III trial. This phase III trial compared the efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) plus carboplatin with solvent-based paclitaxel (sb-paclitaxel) plus carboplatin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In all, 1,052 untreated patients with stage IIIB to IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 100 mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel weekly and carboplatin at area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 6 once every 3 weeks (nab-PC) or 200 mg/m(2) sb-paclitaxel plus carboplatin AUC 6 once every 3 weeks (sb-PC). The primary end point was objective overall response rate (ORR). On the basis of independent assessment, nab-PC demonstrated a significantly higher ORR than sb-PC (33% v 25%; response rate ratio, 1.313; 95% CI, 1.082 to 1.593; P = .005) and in patients with squamous histology (41% v 24%; response rate ratio, 1.680; 95% CI, 1.271 to 2.221; P < .001). nab-PC was as effective as sb-PC in patients with nonsquamous histology (ORR, 26% v 25%; P = .808).

"Ipilimumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment in stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer: results from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase II study. Ipilimumab, which is an anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 monoclonal antibody, showed a survival benefit in melanoma with adverse events (AEs) managed by protocol-defined guidelines. A phase II study in lung cancer assessed the activity of ipilimumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients (N = 204) with chemotherapy-naive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the curve, 6) with either placebo (control) or ipilimumab in one of the following two regimens: concurrent ipilimumab (four doses of ipilimumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by two doses of placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin) or phased ipilimumab (two doses of placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by four doses of ipilimumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin).Treatment was administered intravenously every 3 weeks for ≤ 18 weeks (induction). Eligible patients continued ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks as maintenance therapy. Response was assessed by using immune-related response criteria and modified WHO criteria. The primary end point was immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS). Other end points were progression-free survival (PFS), best overall response rate (BORR), immune-related BORR (irBORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. The study met its primary end point of improved irPFS for phased ipilimumab versus the control (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; P = .05), but not for concurrent ipilimumab (HR, 0.81; P = .13). Phased ipilimumab also improved PFS according to modified WHO criteria (HR, 0.69; P = .02). Phased ipilimumab, concurrent ipilimumab, and control treatments were associated with a median irPFS of 5.7, 5.5, and 4.6 months, respectively, a median PFS of 5.1, 4.1, and 4.2 months, respectively, an irBORR of 32%, 21% and 18%, respectively, a BORR of 32%, 21% and 14%, respectively, and a median OS of 12.2, 9.7, and 8.3 months. Overall rates of grade 3 and 4 immune-related AEs were 15%, 20%, and 6% for phased ipilimumab, concurrent ipilimumab, and the control, respectively. Two patients (concurrent, one patient; control, one patient) died from treatment-related toxicity.

In this proof-of-concept, open-label, phase 2 study, patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) received elotuzumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone (EBd) or bortezomib and dexamethasone (Bd) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary/exploratory endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Two-sided 0.30 significance level was specified (80% power, 103 events) to detect hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69. Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on all randomized patients and all treated patients, respectively. Of 152 randomized patients (77 EBd, 75 Bd), 150 were treated (75 EBd, 75 Bd). PFS was greater with EBd vs Bd (HR, 0.72; 70% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.88; stratified log-rank P = .09); median PFS was longer with EBd (9.7 months) vs Bd (6.9 months). In an updated analysis, EBd-treated patients homozygous for the high-affinity FcγRIIIa allele had median PFS of 22.3 months vs 9.8 months in EBd-treated patients homozygous for the low-affinity allele. ORR was 66% (EBd) vs 63% (Bd). Very good partial response or better occurred in 36% of patients (EBd) vs 27% (Bd). Early OS results, based on 40 deaths, revealed an HR of 0.61 (70% CI, 0.43-0.85). To date, 60 deaths have occurred (28 EBd, 32 Bd). No additional clinically significant adverse events occurred with EBd vs Bd. Grade 1/2 infusion reaction rate was low (5% EBd) and mitigated with premedication. In patients with RRMM, elotuzumab, an immunostimulatory antibody, appears to provide clinical benefit without added clinically significant toxicity when combined with Bd vs Bd alone.

To evaluate the efficacy of maintenance sunitinib after chemotherapy for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30504 trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study that enrolled patients before chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) or carboplatin area under the curve of 5 on day 1 plus etoposide 100 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 to 3 every 21 days for four to six cycles). Patients without progression were randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or sunitinib 37.5 mg per day until progression. Cross-over after progression was allowed. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) from random assignment for maintenance placebo versus sunitinib using a one-sided log-rank test with α = .15; 80 randomly assigned patients provided 89% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67. One hundred forty-four patients were enrolled; 138 patients received chemotherapy. Ninety-five patients were randomly assigned; 10 patients did not receive maintenance therapy (five on each arm). Eighty-five patients received maintenance therapy (placebo, n = 41; sunitinib, n = 44). Grade 3 adverse events with more than 5% incidence were fatigue (19%), decreased neutrophils (14%), decreased leukocytes (7%), and decreased platelets (7%) for sunitinib and fatigue (10%) for placebo; grade 4 adverse events were GI hemorrhage (n = 1) and pancreatitis, hypocalcemia, and elevated lipase (n = 1; all in same patient) for sunitinib and thrombocytopenia (n = 1) and hypernatremia (n = 1) for placebo. Median PFS on maintenance was 2.1 months for placebo and 3.7 months for sunitinib (HR, 1.62; 70% CI, 1.27 to 2.08; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.60; one-sided P = .02). Median overall survival from random assignment was 6.9 months for placebo and 9.0 months for sunitinib (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.79 to 2.10; one-sided P = .16). Three sunitinib and no placebo patients achieved complete response during maintenance. Ten (77%) of 13 patients evaluable after cross-over had stable disease on sunitinib (6 to 27 weeks).

"Maintenance Sunitinib following Initial Platinum-Based Combination Chemotherapy in Advanced-Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Study-CALGB 30607 (Alliance). The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of maintenance sunitinib after first-line chemotherapy for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30607 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study that enrolled patients without progression after four cycles of first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was allowed only during the four cycles of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive sunitinib, 37.5 mg/d, or placebo and were treated until unacceptable adverse event(s), progression, or death. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 210 patients were enrolled, randomized, and included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Ten patients did not receive maintenance therapy (four who received placebo and six who received sunitinib). Grade 3/4 adverse events affecting more than 5% of the patients were fatigue (25%), thrombocytopenia (12%), hypertension (12%), rash (11%), mucositis (11%), neutropenia (7%), and anemia (6%) for sunitinib and none for placebo. There were three grade 5 events in patients receiving sunitinib (one pulmonary hemorrhage, one other pulmonary event, and one death not associated with a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events term) and two grade 5 events in patients receiving placebo (one other pulmonary event and one thromboembolism). Median PFS was 4.3 months for sunitinib and 2.6 months for placebo (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.82, p = 0.0006).

We compared nab-paclitaxel or ixabepilone once per week to paclitaxel with bevacizumab as first-line therapy for patients with advanced breast cancer (BC) to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) for nab-paclitaxel or ixabepilone versus paclitaxel. Eligible patients were age ≥ 18 years with chemotherapy-naive advanced BC. Patients were randomly assigned to bevacizumab with paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) (arm A), nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) (arm B), or ixabepilone 16 mg/m(2) (arm C), once per week for 3 of 4 weeks. Planned enrollment was 900 patients, which would give 88% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.73. In all, 799 patients were enrolled, and 783 received treatment (97% received bevacizumab). Arm C was closed for futility at the first interim analysis (n = 241), and arm A (n = 267) and arm B (n = 275) were closed for futility at the second interim analysis. Median PFS for paclitaxel was 11 months, ixabepilone was inferior to paclitaxel (PFS, 7.4 months; hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.93; P < .001), and nab-paclitaxel was not superior to paclitaxel (PFS, 9.3 months; hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.45; P = .054). Results were concordant with overall survival; time to treatment failure was significantly shorter in both experimental arms v paclitaxel. Hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity, including peripheral neuropathy, was increased with nab-paclitaxel, with more frequent and earlier dose reductions. In patients with chemotherapy-naive advanced BC, ixabepilone once per week was inferior to paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel was not superior with a trend toward inferiority.

"Phase III Trial Evaluating Letrozole As First-Line Endocrine Therapy With or Without Bevacizumab for the Treatment of Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor-Positive Advanced-Stage Breast Cancer: CALGB 40503 (Alliance). To investigate whether anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy with bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) when added to first-line letrozole as treatment of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Women with hormone receptor-positive MBC were randomly assigned 1:1 in a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial of letrozole (2.5 mg orally per day) with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks) within strata defined by measurable disease and disease-free interval. This trial had 90% power to detect a 50% improvement in median PFS from 6 to 9 months. Using a one-sided α = .025, a target sample size of 352 patients was planned. From May 2008 to November 2011, 350 women were recruited; 343 received treatment and were observed for efficacy and safety. Median age was 58 years (range, 25 to 87 years). Sixty-two percent had measurable disease, and 45% had de novo MBC. At a median follow-up of 39 months, the addition of bevacizumab resulted in a significant reduction in the hazard of progression (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.96; P = .016) and a prolongation in median PFS from 15.6 months with letrozole to 20.2 months with letrozole plus bevacizumab. There was no significant difference in overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.18; P = .188), with median overall survival of 43.9 months with letrozole versus 47.2 months with letrozole plus bevacizumab. The largest increases in incidence of grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicities with the addition of bevacizumab were hypertension (24% v 2%) and proteinuria (11% v 0%). The addition of bevacizumab to letrozole improved PFS in hormone receptor-positive MBC, but this benefit was associated with a markedly increased risk of grade 3 to 4 toxicities.

One third of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 × 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab. Patients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed. Patients assigned to either carboplatin or bevacizumab were less likely to complete wP and ddAC without skipped doses, dose modification, or early discontinuation resulting from toxicity. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common with carboplatin, as were hypertension, infection, thromboembolic events, bleeding, and postoperative complications with bevacizumab. Employing one-sided P values, addition of either carboplatin (60% v 44%; P = .0018) or bevacizumab (59% v 48%; P = .0089) significantly increased pCR breast, whereas only carboplatin (54% v 41%; P = .0029) significantly raised pCR breast/axilla. More-than-additive interactions between the two agents could not be demonstrated. In stage II to III TNBC, addition of either carboplatin or bevacizumab to NACT increased pCR rates, but whether this will improve relapse-free or overall survival is unknown. Given results from recently reported adjuvant trials, further investigation of bevacizumab in this setting is unlikely, but the role of carboplatin could be evaluated in definitive studies, ideally limited to biologically defined patient subsets most likely to benefit from this agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25092775/,25092775,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of T-ddAC compared to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of T-ddAC versus T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of T-ddAC and T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of T-ddAC versus T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of T-ddAC when compared with T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of T-ddAC in comparison to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of T-ddAC compared to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of T-ddAC and T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of T-ddAC against T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of T-ddAC compared to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of T-ddAC contrasted with T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of T-ddAC versus T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of T-ddAC and T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of T-ddAC as opposed to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of T-ddAC compared to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how T-ddAC compares to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of T-ddAC in relation to T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of T-ddAC versus T-ddAC and Bevacizumab for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of T-ddAC's efficacy in comparison with T-ddAC and Bevacizumab in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of T-ddAC against T-ddAC and Bevacizumab regarding Breast cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00861705,"{""25092775"": ""William M Sikov|Donald A Berry|Charles M Perou|Baljit Singh|Constance T Cirrincione|Sara M Tolaney|Charles S Kuzma|Timothy J Pluard|George Somlo|Elisa R Port|Mehra Golshan|Jennifer R Bellon|Deborah Collyar|Olwen M Hahn|Lisa A Carey|Clifford A Hudis|Eric P Winer""}",2009-05-15,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Anti-vegf|Platinum-based Chemotherapy|Taxanes
"Randomized Trial of Lenalidomide Alone Versus Lenalidomide Plus Rituximab in Patients With Recurrent Follicular Lymphoma: CALGB 50401 (Alliance). Lenalidomide and rituximab (LR) are active agents in follicular lymphoma (FL). Combination regimens have not been previously assessed in randomized studies. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance) 50401 trial is a randomized phase II trial studying rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks), lenalidomide (15 mg per day on days 1 to 21, followed by 7 days of rest, in cycle 1 and then 20 mg per day on days 1 to 21, followed by 7 days of rest, in cycles 2 to 12), or LR. The rituximab-alone arm was discontinued as a result of poor accrual. Eligibility included recurrent FL and prior rituximab with time to progression of ≥ 6 months from last dose. Aspirin or heparin was recommended for patients at high thrombosis risk. Ninety-one patients (lenalidomide, n = 45; LR, n = 46) received treatment; median age was 63 years (range, 34 to 89 years), and 58% were intermediate or high risk according to the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. In the lenalidomide and LR arms, grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 58% and 53% of patients, with 9% and 11% of patients experiencing grade 4 toxicity, respectively; grade 3 to 4 adverse events included neutropenia (16% v 20%, respectively), fatigue (9% v 13%, respectively), and thrombosis (16% [n = 7] v 4% [n = 2], respectively; P = .157). Thirty-six percent of lenalidomide patients and 63% of LR patients completed 12 cycles. Lenalidomide alone was associated with more treatment failures, with 22% of patients discontinuing treatment as a result of adverse events. Dose-intensity exceeded 80% in both arms. Overall response rate was 53% (20% complete response) and 76% (39% complete response) for lenalidomide alone and LR, respectively (P = .029). At the median follow-up of 2.5 years, median time to progression was 1.1 year for lenalidomide alone and 2 years for LR (P = .0023).

"Randomized Phase III Trial of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin With Bevacizumab or Placebo in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: Results of CALGB 90601 (Alliance). The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) is a standard therapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Based on data that angiogenesis plays a role in urothelial carcinoma growth and progression, a randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed with the primary objective of testing whether patients treated with GC and bevacizumab (GCB) have superior overall survival (OS) than patients treated with GC and placebo (GCP). Between July 2009 and December 2014, 506 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and no neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 months were randomly assigned to receive either GCB or GCP. The primary end point was OS, with secondary end points of progression-free survival, objective response, and toxicity. With a median follow-up of 76.3 months among alive patients, the median OS was 14.5 months for patients treated with GCB and 14.3 months for patients treated with GCP (hazard ratio for death = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05; two-sided stratified log-rank <i>P</i> = .14). The median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for GCB and 6.7 months for GCP (hazard ratio = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.95; <i>P</i> = .016). The proportion of patients with grade 3 or greater adverse events did not differ significantly between both arms, although increased bevacizumab-related toxicities such as hypertension and proteinuria occurred in the bevacizumab-treated arm. The addition of bevacizumab to GC did not result in improved OS.

"Hepatic arterial infusion versus systemic therapy for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: a randomized trial of efficacy, quality of life, and molecular markers (CALGB 9481). Hepatic metastases derive most of their blood supply from the hepatic artery; therefore, for patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of chemotherapy may improve outcome. In a multi-institutional trial, 135 patients were randomly assigned to receive HAI versus systemic bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin. The primary end point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost, and the influence of molecular markers. Overall survival was significantly longer for HAI versus systemic treatment (median, 24.4 v 20 months; P = .0034), as were response rates (47% and 24%; P = .012) and time to hepatic progression (THP; 9.8 v 7.3 months; P = .034). Time to extrahepatic progression (7.7 v 14.8 months; P = .029) was significantly shorter in the HAI group. Quality-of-life measurements showed improved physical functioning in the HAI group at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Toxicity included grade > or = 3 neutropenia (2% and 45%; P < .01), stomatitis (0% and 24%; P < .01), and bilirubin elevation (18.6% and 0; P < .01) in the HAI and systemic treatment groups, respectively. A greater proportion of men versus women receiving HAI experienced biliary toxicity (37% and 15%, respectively; P = .05). For HAI patients with thymidylate synthase levels in tumor less than or > or = 4, the median survival was 24 and 14 months, respectively (P = .17). HAI therapy increased overall survival, response rate, THP, and was associated with better physical functioning compared with systemic therapy. Additional studies need to address the overall benefit and cost of new chemotherapy agents versus HAI alone or the combination of HAI with new agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16505413/,16505413,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of FULV compared to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy when used to treat Colorectal cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of FULV versus Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of FULV and Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of FULV versus Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of FULV when compared with Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for Colorectal cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of FULV in comparison to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of FULV compared to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for addressing Colorectal cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of FULV and Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in the treatment of Colorectal cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of FULV against Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for managing Colorectal cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of FULV compared to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of FULV contrasted with Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in relation to Colorectal cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of FULV versus Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of FULV and Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of FULV as opposed to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in managing Colorectal cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of FULV compared to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in the context of Colorectal cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how FULV compares to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Colorectal cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of FULV in relation to Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of FULV versus Hepatic arterial chemotherapy for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of FULV's efficacy in comparison with Hepatic arterial chemotherapy in treating Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of FULV against Hepatic arterial chemotherapy regarding Colorectal cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00002716,"{""16505413"": ""Nancy E Kemeny|Donna Niedzwiecki|Donna R Hollis|Heinz-Josef Lenz|Robert S Warren|Michelle J Naughton|Jane C Weeks|Elin R Sigurdson|James E Herndon|Chunfeng Zhang|Robert J Mayer""}",1996-01,Yes,No,Unknown,Antimetabolites|Corticosteroids
"Randomized trial of dose-dense versus conventionally scheduled and sequential versus concurrent combination chemotherapy as postoperative adjuvant treatment of node-positive primary breast cancer: first report of Intergroup Trial C9741/Cancer and Leukemia Group B Trial 9741. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, we studied the adjuvant chemotherapy of women with axillary node-positive breast cancer to compare sequential doxorubicin (A), paclitaxel (T), and cyclophosphamide (C) with concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel (T) for disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS); to determine whether the dose density of the agents improves DFS and OS; and to compare toxicities. A total of 2,005 female patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following regimens: (I) sequential A x 4 (doses) --> T x 4 --> C x 4 with doses every 3 weeks, (II) sequential A x 4 --> T x 4 --> C x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim, (III) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 3 weeks, or (IV) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim. A protocol-specified analysis was performed at a median follow-up of 36 months: 315 patients had experienced relapse or died, compared with 515 expected treatment failures. Dose-dense treatment improved the primary end point, DFS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74; P =.010), and OS (RR = 0.69; P =.013). Four-year DFS was 82% for the dose-dense regimens and 75% for the others. There was no difference in either DFS or OS between the concurrent and sequential schedules. There was no interaction between density and sequence.

"Phase III trial of trimodality therapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil, radiotherapy, and surgery compared with surgery alone for esophageal cancer: CALGB 9781. The primary treatment modality for patients with carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction has been surgery, although primary radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy produces similar results. As both have curative potential, there has been great interest in the use of trimodality therapy. To this end, we compared survival, response, and patterns of failure of trimodality therapy to esophagectomy alone in patients with nonmetastatic esophageal cancer. Four hundred seventy-five eligible patients were planned for enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to either esophagectomy with node dissection alone or cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) and fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d for 4 days on weeks 1 and 5 concurrent with radiation therapy (50.4 Gy total: 1.8 Gy/fraction over 5.6 weeks) followed by esophagectomy with node dissection. Fifty-six patients were enrolled between October 1997 and March 2000, when the trial was closed due to poor accrual. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to trimodality therapy and 26 were assigned to surgery alone. Patient and tumor characteristics were similar between groups. Treatment was generally well tolerated. Median follow-up was 6 years. An intent-to-treat analysis showed a median survival of 4.48 v 1.79 years in favor of trimodality therapy (exact stratified log-rank, P = .002). Five-year survival was 39% (95% CI, 21% to 57%) v 16% (95% CI, 5% to 33%) in favor of trimodality therapy. The results from this trial reflect a long-term survival advantage with the use of chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in the treatment of esophageal cancer, and support trimodality therapy as a standard of care for patients with this disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18309943/,18309943,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy compared to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT when used to treat Esophageal cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy versus Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in treating Esophageal cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy and Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for managing Esophageal cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy versus Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in treating Esophageal cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy when compared with Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for Esophageal cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy in comparison to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for the treatment of Esophageal cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy compared to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for addressing Esophageal cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy and Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in the treatment of Esophageal cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy against Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for managing Esophageal cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy compared to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in treating Esophageal cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy contrasted with Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in relation to Esophageal cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy versus Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for treating Esophageal cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy and Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in treating Esophageal cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy as opposed to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in managing Esophageal cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy compared to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in the context of Esophageal cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how No neoadjuvant therapy compares to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in terms of effectiveness for Esophageal cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy in relation to Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for the treatment of Esophageal cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of No neoadjuvant therapy versus Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT for managing Esophageal cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of No neoadjuvant therapy's efficacy in comparison with Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT in treating Esophageal cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of No neoadjuvant therapy against Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) and RT regarding Esophageal cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003118,"{""18309943"": ""Joel Tepper|Mark J Krasna|Donna Niedzwiecki|Donna Hollis|Carolyn E Reed|Richard Goldberg|Krystyna Kiel|Christopher Willett|David Sugarbaker|Robert Mayer""}",1997-10,Yes,No,Unknown,Antimetabolites|Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"Randomized phase III trial of gemcitabine and cisplatin vs. gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a performance status of 2: the CAPPA-2 study. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the evidence of its efficacy among ECOG performance status (PS)2 patients is weak because these patients are usually excluded from clinical trials; concern exists about tolerability and feasibility of standard chemotherapy in these patients. No prospective randomized trial has tested the addition of cisplatin to single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PS2. CAPPA-2 was a multicenter, randomized phase 3 study for first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients, aged 18-70, were eligible if they had stage IV or IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or metastatic supraclavicular nodes (TNM VI edition) and adequate organ function. Patients in standard arm received gemcitabine 1200 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. Patients in experimental arm received cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. All treatments were repeated every 3 weeks, up to 4 cycles, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). To have 80% power of detecting hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, corresponding to an increase in median OS from 4.8 to 6.8 months, 285 deaths were required.

"A randomized Phase III trial of neoadjuvant recombinant human endostatin, docetaxel and epirubicin as first-line therapy for patients with breast cancer (CBCRT01). To further assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant human endostatin (rh-endostatin), a Phase III, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted. Patients to be treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel and epirubicin (DE) or DE plus rh-endostatin (DEE) were eligible for this trial. The primary endpoint was clinical/pathological response. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and quality of life (QOL). Finally, 803 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive DE (n = 402) or DEE (n = 401) regimen. After three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, ""complete response"" achieved in 14.2% of patients in DEE group versus 6.7% in DE group, ""partial response"" achieved in 76.8% versus 71.1%, while ""stable disease"" in 6.0% versus 18.9%, ""progressive disease"" in 3.0% versus 3.2% of patients. The rate of objective response in DEE and DE group was 91.0% and 77.9%, respectively (p < 0.001). In spite of a relatively higher pathological complete response achieved following the combination therapy, no significant difference was found between two arms. Adverse events were mostly of Grades 1-2. No significant difference in adverse event and QOL was found between the two arms.

"Adjuvant Capecitabine With Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide Plus Epirubicin for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (CBCSG010): An Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase III Trial. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) includes a taxane and an anthracycline. Concomitant capecitabine may be beneficial, but robust data to support this are lacking. The efficacy and safety of the addition of capecitabine into the TNBC adjuvant treatment regimen was evaluated. This randomized, open-label, phase III trial was conducted in China. Eligible female patients with early TNBC after definitive surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to either capecitabine (3 cycles of capecitabine and docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of capecitabine, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) or control treatment (3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Randomization was centralized without stratification. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). Between June 2012 and December 2013, 636 patients with TNBC were screened, and 585 were randomly assigned to treatment (control, 288; capecitabine, 297). Median follow-up was 67 months. The 5-year DFS rate was higher for capecitabine than for control treatment (86.3% <i>v</i> 80.4%; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.99; <i>P</i> = .044). Five-year overall survival rates were numerically higher but not significantly improved (capecitabine, 93.3%; control, 90.7%). Overall, 39.1% of patients had capecitabine dose reductions, and 8.4% reported grade ≥ 3 hand-foot syndrome. The most common grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (capecitabine, 136 [45.8%]; control, 118 [41.0%]) and febrile neutropenia (capecitabine, 50 [16.8%]; control, 46 [16.0%]). Safety data were similar to the known capecitabine safety profile and generally comparable between arms. Capecitabine when added to 3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of a 3-drug anthracycline combination containing capecitabine instead of fluorouracil significantly improved DFS in TNBC without new safety concerns.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32275467/,32275467,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of TX-CEX compared to D-FEC when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of TX-CEX versus D-FEC in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of TX-CEX and D-FEC for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of TX-CEX versus D-FEC in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of TX-CEX when compared with D-FEC for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of TX-CEX in comparison to D-FEC for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of TX-CEX compared to D-FEC for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of TX-CEX and D-FEC in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of TX-CEX against D-FEC for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of TX-CEX compared to D-FEC in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of TX-CEX contrasted with D-FEC in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of TX-CEX versus D-FEC for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of TX-CEX and D-FEC in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of TX-CEX as opposed to D-FEC in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of TX-CEX compared to D-FEC in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how TX-CEX compares to D-FEC in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of TX-CEX in relation to D-FEC for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of TX-CEX versus D-FEC for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of TX-CEX's efficacy in comparison with D-FEC in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of TX-CEX against D-FEC regarding Breast cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01642771,"{""32275467"": ""Junjie Li|Keda Yu|Da Pang|Changqin Wang|Jun Jiang|Suisheng Yang|Yunjiang Liu|Peifen Fu|Yuan Sheng|Guojun Zhang|Yali Cao|Qi He|Shude Cui|Xijing Wang|Guosheng Ren|Xinzheng Li|Shiyou Yu|Pengxi Liu|Xiang Qu|Jinhai Tang|Ouchen Wang|Zhimin Fan|Guoqin Jiang|Jin Zhang|Jiandong Wang|Hongwei Zhang|Shui Wang|Jianguo Zhang|Feng Jin|Nanyan Rao|Binlin Ma|Pingqing He|Binghe Xu|Zhigang Zhuang|Jianfeng Wang|Qiang Sun|Xiaofeng Guo|Miao Mo|Zhimin Shao|CBCSG010 Study Group""}",2012-06,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Taxanes
"Addition of anti-thymocyte globulin to standard graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis versus standard treatment alone in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing transplantation from unrelated donors: final analysis of a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial. Previous trials testing prevention strategies for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) have measured its cumulative incidence. In this trial of anti-thymocyte globulin, we measured treatment-independence at a long-term timepoint as the primary endpoint. This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at ten centres in Canada and one in Australia. Eligible patients had a haematological malignancy (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or lymphoma), were between 16 and 70 years of age, eligible for transplantation with a Karnofsky score of at least 60, and received an unrelated donor (fully matched or one-locus mismatched at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, or DRB1 loci) graft following myeloablative or non-myeloablative-reduced intensity conditioning. Patients were randomly assigned to receive anti-thymocyte globulin 4·5 mg/kg plus standard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus methotrexate or mycophenolate) or standard GVHD prophylaxis alone. The primary endpoint, freedom from immunosuppressive therapy without resumption at 12 months, was previously reported. Here we report on the prespecified 24-month analysis. Analyses were per-protocol, excluding those patients who did not proceed to transplantation. This trial is registered as ISRCTN 29899028 and NCT01217723, status completed. Between June 9, 2010, and July 8, 2013, we recruited and randomly assigned 203 eligible patients to receive anti-thymocyte globulin (n=101) or no additional treatment (n=102) along with standard GVHD prophylaxis. 7 (3%) patients did not receive a transplant and were excluded from the analysis. 38 (38%) of 99 evaluable patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group were free from immunosuppressive therapy at 24 months compared with 18 (19%) of 97 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3·49 [95% CI 1·60–7·60]; p=0·0016). At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 16·3% (95% CI 8·9–23·7) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 17·5 (9·9–25·1) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0·73) and non-relapse mortality was 21·2% (95% CI 13·2–29·2) versus 31·3% (21·9–40·7; p=0·15). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 24 months was 26·3% (95% CI 17·5–35·1) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 41·3% (31·3–51·3) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0·032). Overall survival at 24 months was 70·6% (95% CI 60·6–78·6) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 53·3% (42·8–62·8) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·56, 95% CI [0·35–0·90]; p=0·017). Symptoms of chronic GVHD by the Lee Scale were more prevalent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, with scores of 13·27 (SD 10·94) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group and 20·38 (SD 14·68) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0·040). Depressive symptoms were more prominent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the mean Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) scores were 10·40 (SD 9·88) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 14·62 (SD 12·26) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0·034). Serious adverse events (CTCAE grade 4 or 5) occurred in 38 (38%) patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and in 49 (51%) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the most common being infection and GVHD. One patient in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group died of Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis, but no deaths were attributable to anti-thymocyte globulin. The results of this prespecified 24-month analysis suggest that pretreatment with anti-thymocyte globulin provides clinically meaningful benefits when added to standard GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing unrelated donor transplantation, including decreases in use of immunosuppressive therapy, chronic GVHD and its symptoms, depressive symptoms, and improved overall survival. Anti-thymocyte globulin should be included in the preparative regimens of patients with haematological malignancies selected for unrelated donor transplantation.

"Pomalidomide alone or in combination with low-dose dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma: a randomized phase 2 study. This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 2 study assessed the efficacy and safety of pomalidomide (POM) with/without low-dose dexamethasone (LoDEX) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Patients who had received ≥2 prior therapies (including lenalidomide [LEN] and bortezomib [BORT]) and had progressed within 60 days of their last therapy were randomized to POM (4 mg/day on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) with/without LoDEX (40 mg/week). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). In total, 221 patients (median 5 prior therapies, range 1-13) received POM+LoDEX (n = 113) or POM (n = 108). With a median follow-up of 14.2 months, median PFS was 4.2 and 2.7 months (hazard ratio = 0.68, P = .003), overall response rates (ORRs) were 33% and 18% (P = .013), median response duration was 8.3 and 10.7 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 16.5 and 13.6 months, respectively.

Ravulizumab, a new complement component C5 inhibitor administered every 8 weeks, was noninferior to eculizumab administered every 2 weeks in complement-inhibitor-naive patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). This study assessed noninferiority of ravulizumab to eculizumab in clinically stable PNH patients during previous eculizumab therapy. In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter study, 195 PNH patients on labeled-dose (900 mg every 2 weeks) eculizumab for >6 months were randomly assigned 1:1 to switch to ravulizumab (n = 97) or continue eculizumab (n = 98). Primary efficacy end point was percentage change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from baseline to day 183. Key secondary end points included proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score, transfusion avoidance, and stabilized hemoglobin. In 191 patients completing 183 days of treatment, ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab (<i>P</i> <sub>inf</sub> < .0006 for all end points), including percentage change in LDH (difference, 9.21% [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.42 to 18.84], <i>P</i> = .058 for superiority), breakthrough hemolysis (difference, 5.1 [95% CI, -8.89 to 18.99]), change in FACIT-Fatigue score (difference, 1.47 [95% CI, -0.21 to 3.15]), transfusion avoidance (difference, 5.5 [95% CI, -4.27 to 15.68]), and stabilized hemoglobin (difference, 1.4 [95% CI, -10.41 to 13.31]).

"Randomized phase III study of surgery alone or surgery plus preoperative cisplatin and gemcitabine in stages IB to IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer. This study aimed to determine whether three preoperative cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by radical surgery provides a reduction in the risk of progression compared with surgery alone in patients with stages IB to IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with chemotherapy-naive NSCLC (stages IB, II, or IIIA) were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) day 1 every 3 weeks followed by surgery, or surgery alone. Randomization was stratified by center and disease stage (IB/IIA v IIB/IIIA). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results The study was prematurely closed after the random assignment of 270 patients: 129 to chemotherapy plus surgery and 141 to surgery alone. Median age was 61.8 years and 83.3% were male. Slightly more patients in the surgery alone arm had disease stage IB/IIA (55.3% v 48.8%). The chemotherapy response rate was 35.4%. The hazard ratios for PFS and overall survival were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.97; P = .003) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.92; P = .02), respectively, both in favor of chemotherapy plus surgery. A statistically significant impact of preoperative chemotherapy on outcomes was observed in the stage IIB/IIIA subgroup (3-year PFS rate: 36.1% v 55.4%; P = .002). The most common grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy-related adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No treatment-by-histology interaction effect was apparent.

"Copanlisib plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (CHRONOS-3): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Copanlisib, an intravenous pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, showed efficacy and safety as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had received at least two therapies. The CHRONOS-3 study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of copanlisib plus rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CHRONOS-3 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in 186 academic medical centres across Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, Russia, South Africa, and South America. Patients aged 18 years and older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of no more than 2 and histologically confirmed CD20-positive indolent B-cell lymphoma relapsed after the last anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy and progression-free and treatment-free for at least 12 months, or at least 6 months for patients unwilling or unfit to receive chemotherapy, were randomly assigned (2:1) with an interactive voice-web response system via block randomisation (block size of six) to copanlisib (60 mg given as a 1-h intravenous infusion on an intermittent schedule on days 1, 8, and 15 [28-day cycle]) plus rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 during cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 3, 5, 7, and 9) or placebo plus rituximab, stratified on the basis of histology, progression-free and treatment-free interval, presence of bulky disease, and previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors. The primary outcome was progression-free survival in the full analysis set (all randomised patients) by masked central review. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of any study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02367040 and is ongoing. Between Aug 3, 2015, and Dec 17, 2019, 652 patients were screened for eligibility. 307 of 458 patients were randomly assigned to copanlisib plus rituximab and 151 patients were randomly assigned to placebo plus rituximab. With a median follow-up of 19·2 months (IQR 7·4-28·8) and 205 total events, copanlisib plus rituximab showed a statistically and clinically significant improvement in progression-free survival versus placebo plus rituximab; median progression-free survival 21·5 months (95% CI 17·8-33·0) versus 13·8 months (10·2-17·5; hazard ratio 0·52 [95% CI 0·39-0·69]; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hyperglycaemia (173 [56%] of 307 patients in the copanlisib plus rituximab group vs 12 [8%] of 146 in the placebo plus rituximab group) and hypertension (122 [40%] vs 13 [9%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 145 (47%) of 307 patients receiving copanlisib plus rituximab and 27 (18%) of 146 patients receiving placebo plus rituximab. One (<1%) drug-related death (pneumonitis) occurred in the copanlisib plus rituximab group and none occurred in the placebo plus rituximab group. Copanlisib plus rituximab improved progression-free survival in patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma compared with placebo plus rituximab. To our knowledge, copanlisib is the first PI3K inhibitor to be safely combined with rituximab and the first to show broad and superior efficacy in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

"Biosimilar candidate IBI305 plus paclitaxel/carboplatin for the treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and used for treatments of various cancers. Due to the high costs of bevacizumab treatments, a biosimilar provides an affordable alternative therapy for cancer patients. In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 study, locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor were enrolled and randomized (1:1) into IBI305 or bevacizumab groups. Patients received 6 cycles of paclitaxel/carboplatin plus IBI305 or bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously followed by IBI305 or bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg maintenance until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by an independent radiological review committee (IRRC) and secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) and safety. A total of 450 NSCLC patients were enrolled (224 in IBI305 group and 226 in bevacizumab group). ORRs were 44.3% for IBI305 and 46.4% for bevacizumab, and the ORR ratio was 0.95 (90% CI: 0.803 to 1.135), within the predefined equivalence margin of 0.75 to 1.33. No significant difference in PFS (7.64 <i>vs.</i> 7.77 m, P=0.9987) was observed between the 2 groups. Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 33.5% (75/224) of patients in the IBI305 group and 37.6% (85/226) in the bevacizumab group.

"Lanreotide in metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Somatostatin analogues are commonly used to treat symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors; however, data on their antitumor effects are limited. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide in patients with advanced, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (a tumor proliferation index [on staining for the Ki-67 antigen] of <10%) and documented disease-progression status. The tumors originated in the pancreas, midgut, or hindgut or were of unknown origin. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreotide (Autogel [known in the United States as Depot], Ipsen) at a dose of 120 mg (101 patients) or placebo (103 patients) once every 28 days for 96 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time to disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0) or death. Secondary end points included overall survival, quality of life (assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-GI.NET21), and safety. Most patients (96%) had no tumor progression in the 3 to 6 months before randomization, and 33% had hepatic tumor volumes greater than 25%. Lanreotide, as compared with placebo, was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median not reached vs. median of 18.0 months, P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.73). The estimated rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 65.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 74.1) in the lanreotide group and 33.0% (95% CI, 23.0 to 43.3) in the placebo group. The therapeutic effect in predefined subgroups was generally consistent with that in the overall population, with the exception of small subgroups in which confidence intervals were wide. There were no significant between-group differences in quality of life or overall survival. The most common treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (in 26% of the patients in the lanreotide group and 9% of those in the placebo group). Lanreotide was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (Ki-67 <10%).

"Rituximab maintenance versus observation following abbreviated induction with chemoimmunotherapy in elderly patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL 2007 SA): an open-label, randomised phase 3 study. Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia relapse after initial therapy combining chemotherapy with rituximab. We assessed the efficacy and safety of rituximab maintenance treatment versus observation for elderly patients in remission after front-line abbreviated induction by fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). This randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 trial at 89 centres in France enrolled treatment-naive and fit patients aged 65 years or older with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia without del(17p). Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 and adequate renal and hepatic function. Patients in response to complete induction treatment with four monthly courses of full-dose FCR with two interim rituximab doses on day 14 of cycles 1 and 2 (oral fludarabine [40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day] and oral cyclophosphamide [250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day] for the first 3 days of each cycle, rituximab at 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 0 of cycle 1 and subsequently at 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 14 of cycle 1, days 1 and 14 of cycle 2, and day 1 of cycles 3 and 4) were eligible for randomisation. Recovery from FCR toxicity and patient willingness to continue the trial were mandatory. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to either receive intravenous rituximab (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every 8 weeks for up to 2 years or undergo observation, with a central computer-generated randomisation list using randomly permuted blocks of variable sizes. Randomisation was stratified by IGHV mutational status, the presence or absence of del(11q), and response level to induction treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with the objective to assess the superiority of rituximab maintenance relative to observation. The final analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug in the rituximab group and in all patients in the observation group. This trial is closed to accrual whilst continuing patient follow-up. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00645606. Between Dec 14, 2007, and Feb 18, 2014, 542 patients were enrolled, of whom 525 started FCR induction. Between June 10, 2008, and Aug 14, 2014, 409 (78%) patients were randomly assigned to rituximab maintenance (n=202) or observation (n=207). Four (2%) patients in the rituximab group did not receive the allocated treatment (progressive disease [n=1], adverse events [n=3]). After a median follow-up of 47·7 months (IQR 30·4-65·8), median progression-free survival in the rituximab group (59·3 months, 95% CI 49·6-not estimable) was improved compared with the observation group (49·0 months, 39·9-60·5; hazard ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·40-0·75; p=0·0002). Neutropenia and grade 3-4 infections were more common with rituximab maintenance (105 [53%] of 198 patients vs 74 [36%] of 207 patients and 38 [19%] vs 21 [10%], respectively) during the study. The most common grade 3-4 infection was lower respiratory tract infection (24 [12%] vs eight [4%]). The incidence of second cancers, except basal cell carcinoma, was similar in both groups (29 [15%] vs 23 [11%]). Deaths were related to adverse events for 23 (11%) patients in the rituximab group and 16 (8%) in the observation group. 2-year maintenance rituximab in selected elderly patients improves progression-free survival and shows an acceptable safety profile. Immunotherapy maintenance strategy is a relevant option in front-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, even in the age of targeted therapy.

"Phase 2 trial of CPX-351, a fixed 5:1 molar ratio of cytarabine/daunorubicin, vs cytarabine/daunorubicin in older adults with untreated AML. CPX-351 is a liposomal formulation of cytarabine:daunorubicin designed to deliver synergistic drug ratios to leukemia cells. In this phase 2 study, newly diagnosed older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were randomized 2:1 to first-line CPX-351 or 7+3 treatment. The goal was to determine efficacy and identify patient subgroups that may benefit from CPX-351 treatment. Response rate (complete remission + incomplete remission) was the primary end point, with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary end points. The 126 patients entered were balanced for disease and patient-specific risk factors. Overall, CPX-351 produced higher response rates (66.7% vs 51.2%, P = .07), meeting predefined criteria for success (P < .1). Differences in EFS and OS were not statistically significant. A planned analysis of the secondary AML subgroup demonstrated an improved response rate (57.6% vs 31.6%, P = .06), and prolongation of EFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59, P = .08) and OS (HR = 0.46, P = .01). Recovery from cytopenias was slower after CPX-351 (median days to absolute neutrophil count ≥1000: 36 vs 32; platelets >100 000: 37 vs 28) with more grade 3-4 infections but without increase in infection-related deaths (3.5% vs 7.3%) or 60-day mortality (4.7% vs 14.6%), indicating acceptable safety. These results suggest a clinical benefit with CPX-351, particularly among patients with secondary AML, and provide the rationale for a phase 3 trial currently underway in newly diagnosed secondary AML patients.

"Drug treatment is superior to allografting as first-line therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia. Early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been proposed as primary treatment modality for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This concept has been challenged by transplantation mortality and improved drug therapy. In a randomized study, primary HSCT and best available drug treatment (IFN based) were compared in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients. Assignment to treatment strategy was by genetic randomization according to availability of a matched related donor. Evaluation followed the intention-to-treat principle. Six hundred and twenty one patients with chronic phase CML were stratified for eligibility for HSCT. Three hundred and fifty four patients (62% male; median age, 40 years; range, 11-59 years) were eligible and randomized. One hundred and thirty five patients (38%) had a matched related donor, of whom 123 (91%) received a transplant within a median of 10 months (range, 2-106 months) from diagnosis. Two hundred and nineteen patients (62%) had no related donor and received best available drug treatment. With an observation time up to 11.2 years (median, 8.9 years), survival was superior for patients with drug treatment (P = .049), superiority being most pronounced in low-risk patients (P = .032). The general recommendation of HSCT as first-line treatment option in chronic phase CML can no longer be maintained.

"Dexamethasone and High-Dose Methotrexate Improve Outcome for Children and Young Adults With High-Risk B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Report From Children's Oncology Group Study AALL0232. Survival for children and young adults with high-risk B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia has improved significantly, but 20% to 25% of patients are not cured. Children's Oncology Group study AALL0232 tested two interventions to improve survival. Between January 2004 and January 2011, AALL0232 enrolled 3,154 participants 1 to 30 years old with newly diagnosed high-risk B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By using a 2 × 2 factorial design, 2,914 participants were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (14 days) versus prednisone (28 days) during induction and high-dose methotrexate versus Capizzi escalating-dose methotrexate plus pegaspargase during interim maintenance 1. Planned interim monitoring showed the superiority of the high-dose methotrexate regimens, which exceeded the predefined boundary and led to cessation of enrollment in January 2011. At that time, participants randomly assigned to high-dose methotrexate during interim maintenance 1 versus those randomly assigned to Capizzi methotrexate had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 82% versus 75.4% (P = .006). Mature final data showed 5-year EFS rates of 79.6% for high-dose methotrexate and 75.2% for Capizzi methotrexate (P = .008). High-dose methotrexate decreased both marrow and CNS recurrences. Patients 1 to 9 years old who received dexamethasone and high-dose methotrexate had a superior outcome compared with those who received the other three regimens (5-year EFS, 91.2% v 83.2%, 80.8%, and 82.1%; P = .015). Older participants derived no benefit from dexamethasone during induction and experienced excess rates of osteonecrosis. High-dose methotrexate is superior to Capizzi methotrexate for the treatment of high-risk B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with no increase in acute toxicity. Dexamethasone given during induction benefited younger children but provided no benefit and was associated with a higher risk of osteonecrosis among participants 10 years and older.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27114587/,27114587,"Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Mercaptopurine, Methotrexate, Vincristine compared to Mercaptopurine, Methotrexate,

"Effect of Postreinduction Therapy Consolidation With Blinatumomab vs Chemotherapy on Disease-Free Survival in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With First Relapse of B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Standard chemotherapy for first relapse of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children, adolescents, and young adults is associated with high rates of severe toxicities, subsequent relapse, and death, especially for patients with early relapse (high risk) or late relapse with residual disease after reinduction chemotherapy (intermediate risk). Blinatumomab, a bispecific CD3 to CD19 T cell-engaging antibody construct, is efficacious in relapsed/refractory B-ALL and has a favorable toxicity profile. To determine whether substituting blinatumomab for intensive chemotherapy in consolidation therapy would improve survival in children, adolescents, and young adults with high- and intermediate-risk first relapse of B-ALL. This trial was a randomized phase 3 clinical trial conducted by the Children's Oncology Group at 155 hospitals in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand with enrollment from December 2014 to September 2019 and follow-up until September 30, 2020. Eligible patients included those aged 1 to 30 years with B-ALL first relapse, excluding those with Down syndrome, Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or prior blinatumomab treatment (n = 669). All patients received a 4-week reinduction chemotherapy course, followed by randomized assignment to receive 2 cycles of blinatumomab (n = 105) or 2 cycles of multiagent chemotherapy (n = 103), each followed by transplant. The primary end point was disease-free survival and the secondary end point was overall survival, both from the time of randomization. The threshold for statistical significance was set at a 1-sided P <.025. Among 208 randomized patients (median age, 9 years; 97 [47%] females), 118 (57%) completed the randomized therapy. Randomization was terminated at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee without meeting stopping rules for efficacy or futility; at that point, 80 of 131 planned events occurred. With 2.9 years of median follow-up, 2-year disease-free survival was 54.4% for the blinatumomab group vs 39.0% for the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or mortality, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.47-1.03]); 1-sided P = .03). Two-year overall survival was 71.3% for the blinatumomab group vs 58.4% for the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for mortality, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.39-0.98]; 1-sided P = .02). Rates of notable serious adverse events included infection (15%), febrile neutropenia (5%), sepsis (2%), and mucositis (1%) for the blinatumomab group and infection (65%), febrile neutropenia (58%), sepsis (27%), and mucositis (28%) for the chemotherapy group. Among children, adolescents, and young adults with high- and intermediate-risk first relapse of B-ALL, postreinduction treatment with blinatumomab compared with chemotherapy, followed by transplant, did not result in a statistically significant difference in disease-free survival. However, study interpretation is limited by early termination with possible underpowering for the primary end point.

"Gemtuzumab ozogamicin in children and adolescents with de novo acute myeloid leukemia improves event-free survival by reducing relapse risk: results from the randomized phase III Children’s Oncology Group trial AAML0531. To improve survival rates in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated gemtuzumab-ozogamicin (GO), a humanized immunoconjugate targeted against CD33, as an alternative to further chemotherapy dose escalation. Our primary objective was to determine whether adding GO to standard chemotherapy improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in children with newly diagnosed AML. Our secondary objectives examined outcomes by risk group and method of intensification. Children, adolescents, and young adults ages 0 to 29 years with newly diagnosed AML were enrolled onto Children’s Oncology Group trial AAML0531 and then were randomly assigned to either standard five-course chemotherapy alone or to the same chemotherapy with two doses of GO (3 mg/m2/dose) administered once in induction course 1 and once in intensification course 2 (two of three). There were 1,022 evaluable patients enrolled. GO significantly improved EFS (3 years: 53.1% v. 46.9%; hazard ratio [HzR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99; P.04) but not OS (3 years: 69.4% v. 65.4%; HzR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P = .39).

"Effect of Tandem Autologous Stem Cell Transplant vs Single Transplant on Event-Free Survival in Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant and subsequent antidisialoganglioside antibody immunotherapy is standard of care for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, but survival rate among these patients remains low. To determine if tandem autologous transplant improves event-free survival (EFS) compared with single transplant. Patients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial from November 2007 to February 2012 at 142 Children's Oncology Group centers in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. A total of 652 eligible patients aged 30 years or younger with protocol-defined high-risk neuroblastoma were enrolled and 355 were randomized. The final date of follow-up was June 29, 2017, and the data analyses cut-off date was June 30, 2017. Patients were randomized to receive tandem transplant with thiotepa/cyclophosphamide followed by dose-reduced carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan (n = 176) or single transplant with carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan (n = 179). The primary outcome was EFS from randomization to the occurrence of the first event (relapse, progression, secondary malignancy, or death from any cause). The study was designed to test the 1-sided hypothesis of superiority of tandem transplant compared with single transplant. Among the 652 eligible patients enrolled, 297 did not undergo randomization because they were nonrandomly assigned (n = 27), ineligible for randomization (n = 62), had no therapy (n = 1), or because of physician/parent preference (n = 207). Among 355 patients randomized (median diagnosis age, 36.1 months; 152 [42.8%] female), 297 patients (83.7%) completed the study and 21 (5.9%) were lost to follow-up after completing protocol therapy. Three-year EFS from the time of randomization was 61.6% (95% CI, 54.3%-68.9%) in the tandem transplant group and 48.4% (95% CI, 41.0%-55.7%) in the single transplant group (1-sided log-rank P=.006). The median (range) duration of follow-up after randomization for 181 patients without an event was 5.6 (0.6-8.9) years. The most common significant toxicities following tandem vs single transplant were mucosal (11.7% vs 15.4%) and infectious (17.9% vs 18.3%). Among patients aged 30 years or younger with high-risk neuroblastoma, tandem transplant resulted in a significantly better EFS than single transplant. However, because of the low randomization rate, the findings may not be representative of all patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

"Belotecan/cisplatin versus etoposide/cisplatin in previously untreated patients with extensive-stage small cell lung carcinoma: a multi-center randomized phase III trial. No novel chemotherapeutic combinations have demonstrated superior efficacy to etoposide/cisplatin (EP), a standard treatment regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung carcinoma (ES-SCLC) over the past decade. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of belotecan/cisplatin (BP) and EP regimens in chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-naïve patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC. We conducted a multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, phase III clinical study. A total of 157 patients were recruited at 14 centers with 147 patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and randomized to either BP (n = 71) or EP (n = 76) treatment arms. A non-inferior response rate (RR) in the BP arm, analyzed by intent-to-treat analysis according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 criteria, was used as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In the BP arm, one patient had a complete response, 41 had a partial response (PR), and 17 had stable disease (SD). In the EP arm, 35 patients had PR and 28 had SD. The RR in the BP arm was non-inferior to the EP regimen in patients with ES-SCLC (BP: 59.2 %, EP: 46.1 %, difference: 13.1 %, 90 % two-sided confidence interval: -0.3-26.5, meeting the predefined non-inferiority criterion of -15.0 %). No significant differences in OS or PFS were observed between the treatment arms. Hematologic toxicities, including grade 3/4 anemia and thrombocytopenia, were significantly more prevalent in the BP arm than the EP arm. The RR to the BP regimen was non-inferior to the EP regimen in chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-naïve patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC. Hematologic toxicities were significantly more prevalent in the BP group, indicating that BP should be used with care, particularly in patients with a poor performance status. Further studies assessing PFS and OS are required to validate the superiority of the BP regimen. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00826644 .

"Regorafenib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in Asian patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (CONCUR): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. In the international randomised phase 3 CORRECT trial (NCT01103323), regorafenib significantly improved overall survival versus placebo in patients with treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Of the 760 patients in CORRECT, 111 were Asian (mostly Japanese). This phase 3 trial was done to assess regorafenib in a broader population of Asian patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer than was studied in CORRECT. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 trial done in 25 hospitals in mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, we recruited Asian patients aged 18 years or older with progressive metastatic colorectal cancer who had received at least two previous treatment lines or were unable to tolerate standard treatments. Patients had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of at least 3 months, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, without other uncontrolled medical disorders. We randomly allocated patients (2:1; with a computer-generated unicentric randomisation list [prepared by the study funder] and interactive voice response system; block size of six; stratified by metastatic site [single vs multiple organs] and time from diagnosis of metastatic disease [<18 months vs ≥18 months]) to receive oral regorafenib 160 mg once daily or placebo on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle; patients in both groups were also to receive best supportive care. Participants, investigators, and the study funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and we analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01584830. Between April 29, 2012, and Feb 6, 2013, we screened 243 patients and randomly assigned 204 patients to receive either regorafenib (136 [67%]) or placebo (68 [33%]). After a median follow-up of 7·4 months (IQR 4·3-12·2), overall survival was significantly better with regorafenib than it was with placebo (hazard ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·40-0·77, one-sided p=0·00016; median overall survival 8·8 months [95% CI 7·3-9·8] in the regorafenib group vs 6·3 months [4·8-7·6] in the placebo group). Drug-related adverse events occurred in 132 (97%) of 136 regorafenib recipients and 31 (46%) of 68 placebo recipients. The most frequent grade 3 or higher regorafenib-related adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (22 [16%] of 136 patients in the regorafenib group vs none in the placebo group), hypertension (15 [11%] vs two [3%] of 68 patients in the placebo group), hyperbilirubinaemia (nine [7%] vs one [1%]), hypophosphataemia (nine [7%] vs none), alanine aminotransferase concentration increases (nine [7%] vs none), aspartate aminotransferase concentration increases (eight [6%] vs none), lipase concentration increases (six [4%] vs one [1%]), and maculopapular rash (six [4%] vs none). Drug-related serious adverse events occurred in 12 (9%) patients in the regorafenib group and three (4%) in the placebo group. This phase 3 trial is the second to show an overall survival benefit with regorafenib compared with placebo in patients with treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, substantiating the role of regorafenib as an important treatment option for patients whose disease has progressed after standard treatments. In this trial, preceding standard treatments did not necessarily include targeted treatments. Adverse events were generally consistent with the known safety profile of regorafenib in this setting.

"Nivolumab versus placebo in patients with relapsed malignant mesothelioma (CONFIRM): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial. No phase 3 trial has yet shown improved survival for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who have progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in these patients. This was a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 24 hospitals in the UK. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, with histologically confirmed pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, who had received previous first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and had radiological evidence of disease progression, were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive nivolumab at a flat dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 min intravenously or placebo until disease progression or a maximum of 12 months. The randomisation sequence was generated within an interactive web response system (Alea); patients were stratified according to epithelioid versus non-epithelioid histology and were assigned in random block sizes of 3 and 6. Participants and treating clinicians were masked to group allocation. The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival, analysed according to the treatment policy estimand (an equivalent of the intention-to-treat principle). All patients who were randomly assigned were included in the safety population, reported according to group allocation. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03063450. Between May 10, 2017, and March 30, 2020, 332 patients were recruited, of whom 221 (67%) were randomly assigned to the nivolumab group and 111 (33%) were assigned to the placebo group). Median follow-up was 11·6 months (IQR 7·2-16·8). Median progression-free survival was 3·0 months (95% CI 2·8-4·1) in the nivolumab group versus 1·8 months (1·4-2·6) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·67 [95% CI 0·53-0·85; p=0·0012). Median overall survival was 10·2 months (95% CI 8·5-12·1) in the nivolumab group versus 6·9 months (5·0-8·0) in the placebo group (adjusted HR 0·69 [95% CI 0·52-0·91]; p=0·0090). The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (six [3%] of 221 in the nivolumab group vs two [2%] of 111 in the placebo group) and infusion-related reaction (six [3%] vs none). Serious adverse events occurred in 90 (41%) patients in the nivolumab group and 49 (44%) patients in the placebo group. There were no treatment-related deaths in either group.

"First-line icotinib versus cisplatin/pemetrexed plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy for patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma (CONVINCE): a phase 3, open-label, randomized study. Icotinib has been previously shown to be non-inferior to gefitinib in non-selected advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients when given as second- or further-line treatment. In this open-label, randomized, phase 3 CONVINCE trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of first-line icotinib versus cisplatin/pemetrexed plus pemetrexed maintenance in lung adenocarcinoma patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Eligible participants were adults with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma and exon 19/21 EGFR mutations. Participants were randomly allocated (1 : 1) to receive oral icotinib or 3-week cycle of cisplatin plus pemetrexed for up to four cycles; non-progressive patients after four cycles were maintained with pemetrexed until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by independent response evaluation committee. Other end points included overall survival (OS) and safety. Between January 2013 and August 2014, 296 patients were randomized, and 285 patients were treated (148 to icotinib, 137 to chemotherapy). Independent response evaluation committee-assessed PFS was significantly longer in the icotinib group (11.2 versus 7.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.87; P = 0.006). No significant difference for OS was observed between treatments in the overall population or in EGFR-mutated subgroups (exon 19 Del/21 L858R). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) in the icotinib group were rash (14.8%) and diarrhea (7.4%), compared with nausea (45.9%), vomiting (29.2%), and neutropenia (10.9%) in the chemotherapy group. AEs (79.1% versus 94.2%; P < 0.001) and treatment-related AEs (54.1% versus 90.5%; P < 0.001) were significantly fewer in the icotinib group than in the chemotherapy group. First-line icotinib significantly improves PFS of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation with a tolerable and manageable safety profile.

"Randomized trial of myeloablative conditioning regimens: busulfan plus cyclophosphamide versus busulfan plus fludarabine. We conducted a phase III randomized clinical trial to compare two myeloablative conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. After randomization, 64 patients received busulfan (3.2 mg/kg per day × 4 days) plus cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg per day × 2 days; BuCy), and 62 patients received busulfan (same dose and schedule) plus fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) per day × 5 days; BuFlu). The median age was 41 years (range, 17 to 59 years). Five patients in the BuFlu arm experienced graft failure (primary, n = 1; secondary, n = 4). At 4 weeks after HCT, the median percentage of recipient hematopoietic chimerism was significantly greater in the BuFlu arm (0% v 5.5%; P < .001), and complete donor chimerism was greater in the BuCy arm (97.2% v 44.4%; P < .001). Severe (grade 3 or higher) infection and gastrointestinal adverse events were significantly more common in the BuCy arm, but the frequencies of hepatic adverse events were similar in the two arms. Nonrelapse mortality was similar in the two arms, but the BuCy arm had better overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and event-free survival (EFS; OS at 2 years, 67.4% v 41.4%, P = .014; RFS, 74.7% v 54.9%, P = .027; EFS, 60.7% v 36.0%, P = .014).

"Docetaxel versus active symptom control for refractory oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (COUGAR-02): an open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial. Second-line chemotherapy for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma refractory to platinum and fluoropyrimidines has not shown benefits in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We assessed whether the addition of docetaxel to active symptom control alone can improve survival and HRQoL for patients. For this open-labelled, multicentre trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older from 30 UK centres. Patients were eligible if they had an advanced, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction, or stomach that had progressed on or within 6 months of treatment with a platinum-fluoropyrimidine combination. Patients could have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. We randomly assigned patients using a central, computerised minimisation procedure to receive docetaxel plus active symptom control, or active symptom control alone (1:1; stratified by disease status, disease site, duration of response to previous chemotherapy, and performance status). Docetaxel was given at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This is the report of the planned final analysis. This study is an International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN13366390. Between April 21, 2008, and April 26, 2012, we recruited 168 patients, allocating 84 to each treatment group. After a median follow-up of 12 months [IQR 10-21]) and 161 (96%) deaths (80 in the docetaxel group, 81 in the active symptom control group), median overall survival in the docetaxel group was 5.2 months (95% CI 4.1-5.9) versus 3.6 months (3.3-4.4) in the active symptom control group (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92; p=0.01). Docetaxel was associated with higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia (12 [15%] patients vs no patients), infection (15 [19%] patients vs two [3%] patients), and febrile neutropenia (six [7%] patients vs no patients). Patients receiving docetaxel reported less pain (p=0.0008) and less nausea and vomiting (p=0.02) and constipation (p=0.02). Global HRQoL was similar between the groups (p=0.53). Disease specific HRQoL measures also showed benefits for docetaxel in reducing dysphagia (p=0.02) and abdominal pain (p=0.01).

"Olaratumab and doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone for treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma: an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 trial. Treatment with doxorubicin is a present standard of care for patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma and median overall survival for those treated is 12-16 months, but few, if any, novel treatments or chemotherapy combinations have been able to improve these poor outcomes. Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal antibody that has antitumour activity in human sarcoma xenografts. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaratumab plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. We did an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 study of doxorubicin plus olaratumab treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma at 16 clinical sites in the USA. For both the phase 1b and phase 2 parts of the study, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma not previously treated with an anthracycline, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, and available tumour tissue to determine PDGFRα expression by immunohistochemistry. In the phase 2 part of the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either olaratumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1 and day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)) or doxorubicin alone (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to eight cycles. Randomisation was dynamic and used the minimisation randomisation technique. The phase 1b primary endpoint was safety and the phase 2 primary endpoint was progression-free survival using a two-sided α level of 0.2 and statistical power of 0.8. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01185964. 15 patients were enrolled and treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin in the phase 1b study, and 133 patients were randomised (66 to olaratumab plus doxorubicin; 67 to doxorubicin alone) in the phase 2 trial, 129 (97%) of whom received at least one dose of study treatment (64 received olaratumab plus doxorubicin, 65 received doxorubicin). Median progression-free survival in phase 2 was 6.6 months (95% CI 4.1-8.3) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 4.1 months (2.8-5.4) with doxorubicin (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 0.44-1.02, p=0.0615). Median overall survival was 26.5 months (20.9-31.7) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 14.7 months (9.2-17.1) with doxorubicin (stratified HR 0.46, 0.30-0.71, p=0.0003). The objective response rate was 18.2% (9.8-29.6) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 11.9% (5.3-22.2) with doxorubicin (p=0.3421). Steady state olaratumab serum concentrations were reached during cycle 3 with mean maximum and trough concentrations ranging from 419 μg/mL (geometric coefficient of variation in percentage [CV%] 26.2) to 487 μg/mL (CV% 33.0) and from 123 μg/mL (CV% 31.2) to 156 μg/mL (CV% 38.0), respectively. Adverse events that were more frequent with olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone included neutropenia (37 [58%] vs 23 [35%]), mucositis (34 [53%] vs 23 [35%]), nausea (47 [73%] vs 34 [52%]), vomiting (29 [45%] vs 12 [18%]), and diarrhoea (22 [34%] vs 15 [23%]).

"Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone provide significant reduction in toxicity compared with doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: a Phase III multicenter randomized trial. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has pharmacologic and safety advantages over conventional doxorubicin. For this noninferiority trial, 192 patients with newly diagnosed, active multiple myeloma were randomized to receive either combined pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (40 mg/m(2)) and vincristine (1.4 mg/m(2); maximum, 2.0 mg) as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 plus reduced-dose dexamethasone (40 mg) orally on Days 1-4 (DVd) (n = 97 patients) or combined vincristine (0.4 mg per day) and conventional doxorubicin (9 mg/m(2) per day) as a continuous intravenous infusion on Days 1-4 plus reduced-dose dexamethasone (VAd) (n = 95 patients) for at least 4 cycles. Treatment was repeated every 4 weeks until patients either achieved maximal response, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity or underwent transplantation. The primary endpoints were response and toxicity. Objective response rates (DVd, 44%; VAd, 41%), progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.11; P = 0.69), and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.88; P = 0.67) were similar between the treatment groups. However, DVd was associated with significantly less Grade 3/4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever (10% vs. 24%; P = 0.01), a lower incidence of sepsis, and less antibiotic use. Compared with VAd, DVd also significantly decreased the need for central venous access (P < 0.0001) and growth-factor support (P = 0.03) and resulted in less alopecia (20% vs. 44%; P < 0.001) but more hand-foot syndrome (25% vs. 1%; P < 0.001), mainly Grade 1/2.

"Ibrutinib versus rituximab in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma: a randomized, open-label phase 3 study. In the Asia-Pacific region, treatment options are limited for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Rituximab is widely used in this setting when purine analog-based therapies are not appropriate. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib compared with rituximab in a randomized, open-label phase 3 study in predominantly Asian patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL. Patients (N = 160) were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 420 mg ibrutinib (n = 106) until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity or up to six cycles of rituximab (n = 54). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS); key secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Rituximab-treated patients could crossover to receive ibrutinib after confirmed PD. At data cutoff, median treatment duration was 16.4 months for ibrutinib and 4.6 months for rituximab. Ibrutinib significantly improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.180, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.105-0.308). ORR was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) with ibrutinib (53.8%) than with rituximab (7.4%). At a median follow-up of 17.8 months, ibrutinib improved OS compared with rituximab (HR = 0.446; 95% CI: 0.221-0.900; P = 0.0206). Overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar between treatments and was not exposure-adjusted. With ibrutinib, most common AEs were diarrhea and platelet count decreased; with rituximab, most common AEs were neutrophil count decreased and platelet count decreased. Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in 82.7% of ibrutinib-treated patients and 59.6% of rituximab-treated patients. Ibrutinib improved PFS, ORR, and OS compared with rituximab and displayed a manageable safety profile in Asian patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29533000/,29533000,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy compared to Ibrutinib monotherapy when used to treat Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy versus Ibrutinib monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy and Ibrutinib monotherapy for managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy versus Ibrutinib monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy when compared with Ibrutinib monotherapy for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy in comparison to Ibrutinib monotherapy for the treatment of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy compared to Ibrutinib monotherapy for addressing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy and Ibrutinib monotherapy in the treatment of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy against Ibrutinib monotherapy for managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy compared to Ibrutinib monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy contrasted with Ibrutinib monotherapy in relation to Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy versus Ibrutinib monotherapy for treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy and Ibrutinib monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy as opposed to Ibrutinib monotherapy in managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy compared to Ibrutinib monotherapy in the context of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,What option most accurately summarizes how Rituximab monotherapy compares to Ibrutinib monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy in relation to Ibrutinib monotherapy for the treatment of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Rituximab monotherapy versus Ibrutinib monotherapy for managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Rituximab monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Ibrutinib monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy against Ibrutinib monotherapy regarding Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01973387,"{""29533000"": ""Xiaojun Huang|Lugui Qiu|Jie Jin|Daobin Zhou|Xiequn Chen|Ming Hou|Jianda Hu|Yu Hu|Xiaoyan Ke|Junmin Li|Yingmin Liang|Ting Liu|Yue Lv|Hanyun Ren|Aining Sun|Jianmin Wang|Chunting Zhao|Mariya Salman|Steven Sun|Angela Howes|Jingzhao Wang|Peng Wu|Jianyong Li""}",2013-10-28,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Btk Inhibitors|Monoclonal Antibodies
"Phase III randomized comparison of gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus capecitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Both gemcitabine (GEM) and fluoropyrimidines are valuable treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. This open-label study was designed to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients randomly assigned to GEM alone or GEM plus capecitabine (GEM-CAP). Patients with previously untreated histologically or cytologically proven locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas with a performance status <or= 2 were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to GEM or GEM-CAP. The primary outcome measure was survival. Meta-analysis of published studies was also conducted. Between May 2002 and January 2005, 533 patients were randomly assigned to GEM (n = 266) and GEM-CAP (n = 267) arms. GEM-CAP significantly improved objective response rate (19.1% v 12.4%; P = .034) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P = .004) and was associated with a trend toward improved OS (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.02; P = .08) compared with GEM alone. This trend for OS benefit for GEM-CAP was consistent across different prognostic subgroups according to baseline stratification factors (stage and performance status) and remained after adjusting for these stratification factors (P = .077). Moreover, the meta-analysis of two additional studies involving 935 patients showed a significant survival benefit in favor of GEM-CAP (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.98; P = .02) with no intertrial heterogeneity.

"Rituximab versus a watch-and-wait approach in patients with advanced-stage, asymptomatic, non-bulky follicular lymphoma: an open-label randomised phase 3 trial. Patients with advanced-stage, low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma have conventionally undergone watchful waiting until disease progression. We assessed whether rituximab use could delay the need for chemotherapy or radiotherapy compared with watchful waiting and the effect of this strategy on quality of life (QoL). Asymptomatic patients (aged ≥18 years) with low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma (grades 1, 2, and 3a) were randomly assigned centrally (1:1:1), by the minimisation approach stratified by institution, grade, stage, and age, to watchful waiting, rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks (rituximab induction), or rituximab induction followed by a maintenance schedule of 12 further infusions given at 2-monthly intervals for 2 years (maintenance rituximab). On Sept 30, 2007, recruitment into the rituximab induction group was closed and the study was amended to a two-arm study. The primary endpoints were time to start of new treatment and QoL at month 7 (ie, 6 months after completion of rituximab induction). All randomly assigned patients were included in the analysis of time to start of new treatment on an intention-to-treat basis. The main study is now completed and is in long-term follow-up. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00112931. Between Oct 15, 2004, and March 25, 2009, 379 patients from 118 centres in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, and Poland were randomly assigned to watchful waiting or maintenance rituximab. 84 patients were recruited to the rituximab induction group before it was closed early. There was a significant difference in the time to start of new treatment, with 46% (95% CI 39-53) of patients in the watchful waiting group not needing treatment at 3 years compared with 88% (83-92) in the maintenance rituximab group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·21, 95% CI 0·14-0·31; p<0·0001). 78% (95% CI 69-87) of patients in the rituximab induction group did not need treatment at 3 years, which was significantly more than in the watchful waiting group (HR 0·35, 95% CI 0·22-0·56; p<0·0001), but no different compared with the maintenance rituximab group (0·75, 0·41-1·34; p=0·33). Compared with the watchful waiting group, patients in the maintenance rituximab group had significant improvements in the Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale score (p=0·0004), and Illness Coping Style score (p=0·0012) between baseline and month 7. Patients in the rituximab induction group did not show improvements in their QoL compared with the watchful waiting group. There were 18 serious adverse events reported in the rituximab groups (four in the rituximab induction group and 14 in the maintenance rituximab group), 12 of which were grade 3 or 4 (five infections, three allergic reactions, and four cases of neutropenia), all of which fully resolved.

"Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of the biosimilar CT-P10 in comparison with rituximab in patients with previously untreated low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma: a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial. Studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and advanced follicular lymphoma have shown that CT-P10, a rituximab biosimilar, has equivalent or non-inferior efficacy and pharmacokinetics to rituximab. We aimed to assess the therapeutic equivalence of single-agent CT-P10 and rituximab in patients with newly diagnosed low-tumour burden follicular lymphoma. In this ongoing, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, phase 3 trial, adult patients (≥18 years) with stage II-IV low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web or voice response system stratified by region, stage, and age to CT-P10 or US-sourced rituximab. Patients received CT-P10 or rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous) on day 1 of four 7-day cycles (induction period). Patients who had disease control after the induction period continued to a maintenance period of CT-P10 or rituximab administered every 8 weeks for six cycles and, if completed, a second year of maintenance therapy of additional CT-P10 (every 8 weeks for six cycles) was offered. The study was partially unmasked after database lock (Feb 23, 2018) for all data up to 7 months (before cycle 3 of the maintenance period). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response by 7 months in the intention-to-treat population. Efficacy equivalence was shown if the two-sided 90% CIs for the treatment difference in the proportion of responders between CT-P10 and rituximab was within the equivalence margin of 17%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02260804. Between Nov 9, 2015, and Jan 4, 2018, 402 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 258 were randomly assigned: 130 to CT-P10 and 128 to rituximab. 108 (83%) of 130 patients assigned to CT-P10 and 104 (81%) of 128 assigned to rituximab achieved an overall response by month 7 (treatment difference estimate 1·8%; 90% CI -6·43 to 10·20). Therapeutic equivalence was shown (90% CIs were within the prespecified margin of 17%). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (two grade 3 in the CT-P10 group) and neutropenia (one in each group); all other grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in one patient each. Six (5%) of 130 patients who received CT-P10 and three (2%) of 128 who received rituximab experienced at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event. CT-P10 was equivalent to rituximab in terms of efficacy and was well tolerated. CT-P10 monotherapy is suggested as a new therapeutic option for patients with low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma.

"Sequential administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab with a planned switch in patients with advanced melanoma (CheckMate 064): an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial. Concurrent administration of the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and ipilimumab has shown greater efficacy than either agent alone in patients with advanced melanoma, albeit with more high-grade adverse events. We assessed whether sequential administration of nivolumab followed by ipilimumab, or the reverse sequence, could improve safety without compromising efficacy. We did this randomised, open-label, phase 2 study at nine academic medical centres in the USA. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (treatment-naive or who had progressed after no more than one previous systemic therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1) were randomly assigned (1:1) to induction with intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for six doses followed by a planned switch to intravenous ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, or the reverse sequence. Randomisation was done by an independent interactive voice response system with a permuted block schedule (block size four) without stratification factors. After induction, both groups received intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events until the end of the induction period (week 25), analysed in the as-treated population. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a response at week 25 and disease progression at weeks 13 and 25. Overall survival was a prespecified exploratory endpoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01783938, and is ongoing but no longer enrolling patients. Between April 30, 2013, and July 21, 2014, 140 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to nivolumab followed by ipilimumab (n=70) or to the reverse sequence of ipilimumab followed by nivolumab (n=70), of whom 68 and 70 patients, respectively, received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the analyses. The frequencies of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events up to week 25 were similar in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group (34 [50%; 95% CI 37·6-62·4] of 68 patients) and in the ipilimumab followed by nivolumab group (30 [43%; 31·1-55·3] of 70 patients). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events during the whole study period were colitis (ten [15%]) in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group vs 14 [20%] in the reverse sequence group), increased lipase (ten [15%] vs 12 [17%]), and diarrhoea (eight [12%] vs five [7%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred. The proportion of patients with a response at week 25 was higher with nivolumab followed by ipilimumab than with the reverse sequence (28 [41%; 95% CI 29·4-53·8] vs 14 [20%; 11·4-31·3]). Progression was reported in 26 (38%; 95% CI 26·7-50·8) patients in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group and 43 (61%; 49·0-72·8) patients in the reverse sequence group at week 13 and in 26 (38%; 26·7-50·8) and 42 (60%; 47·6-71·5) patients at week 25, respectively. After a median follow-up of 19·8 months (IQR 12·8-25·7), median overall survival was not reached in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group (95% CI 23·7-not reached), whereas over a median follow-up of 14·7 months (IQR 5·6-23·9) in the ipilimumab followed by nivolumab group, median overall survival was 16·9 months (95% CI 9·2-26·5; HR 0·48 [95% CI 0·29-0·80]). A higher proportion of patients in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group achieved 12-month overall survival than in the ipilimumab followed by nivolumab group (76%; 95% CI 64-85 vs 54%; 42-65). Nivolumab followed by ipilimumab appears to be a more clinically beneficial option compared with the reverse sequence, albeit with a higher frequency of adverse events.

"Nivolumab versus sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (CheckMate 459): a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial. Single-agent nivolumab showed durable responses, manageable safety, and promising survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the phase 1-2 CheckMate 040 study. We aimed to investigate nivolumab monotherapy compared with sorafenib monotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at medical centres across 22 countries and territories in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America, patients at least 18 years old with histologically confirmed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for, or whose disease had progressed after, surgery or locoregional treatment; with no previous systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, with Child-Pugh class A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and regardless of viral hepatitis status were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02576509. Between Jan 11, 2016, and May 24, 2017, 743 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (nivolumab, n=371; sorafenib, n=372). At the primary analysis, the median follow-up for overall survival was 15·2 months (IQR 5·7-28·0) for the nivolumab group and 13·4 months (5·7-25·9) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 16·4 months (95% CI 13·9-18·4) with nivolumab and 14·7 months (11·9-17·2) with sorafenib (hazard ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·72-1·02]; p=0·075; minimum follow-up 22·8 months); the protocol-defined significance level of p=0·0419 was not reached. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (1 [<1%] of 367 patients in the nivolumab group vs 52 [14%] of patients in the sorafenib group), aspartate aminotransferase increase (22 [6%] vs 13 [4%]), and hypertension (0 vs 26 [7%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 43 (12%) patients receiving nivolumab and 39 (11%) patients receiving sorafenib. Four deaths in the nivolumab group and one death in the sorafenib group were assessed as treatment related. First-line nivolumab treatment did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib, but clinical activity and a favourable safety profile were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, nivolumab might be considered a therapeutic option for patients in whom tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs are contraindicated or have substantial risks.

Patients with disease progression after first- or second-generation EGFR TKI therapy (without <i>EGFR</i> T790M mutation) or osimertinib (with/without T790M mutation) were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab (360 mg once every 3 weeks) plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (once every 3 weeks) or platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone (once every 3 weeks) for four cycles. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included 9- and 12-month PFS rates, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR). Overall, 294 patients were randomly assigned. At final analysis (median follow-up, 38.1 months), PFS was not significantly improved with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (median, 5.6 <i>v</i> 5.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56 to 1.00]; <i>P</i> = .0528), with 9- and 12-month PFS rates of 25.9% versus 19.8%, and 21.2% versus 15.9%, respectively. Post hoc PFS subgroup analyses showed a trend favoring nivolumab plus chemotherapy in patients with tumors harboring sensitizing <i>EGFR</i> mutations (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.97]), one line of previous EGFR TKI (0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.97]), or both (0.64 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.88]).

"Perioperative Nivolumab in Resectable Lung Cancer. Standard treatment with neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy significantly improves outcomes in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Perioperative treatment (i.e., neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy) with nivolumab may further improve clinical outcomes. In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned adults with resectable stage IIA to IIIB NSCLC to receive neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus placebo every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by surgery and adjuvant nivolumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 1 year. The primary outcome was event-free survival according to blinded independent review. Secondary outcomes were pathological complete response and major pathological response according to blinded independent review, overall survival, and safety. At this prespecified interim analysis (median follow-up, 25.4 months), the percentage of patients with 18-month event-free survival was 70.2% in the nivolumab group and 50.0% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or recurrence, abandoned surgery, or death, 0.58; 97.36% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.81; P<0.001). A pathological complete response occurred in 25.3% of the patients in the nivolumab group and in 4.7% of those in the chemotherapy group (odds ratio, 6.64; 95% CI, 3.40 to 12.97); a major pathological response occurred in 35.4% and 12.1%, respectively (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.48 to 6.49).

"Neoadjuvant Nivolumab plus Chemotherapy in Resectable Lung Cancer. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy confers a modest benefit over surgery alone for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In early-phase trials, nivolumab-based neoadjuvant regimens have shown promising clinical activity; however, data from phase 3 trials are needed to confirm these findings. In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with stage IB to IIIA resectable NSCLC to receive nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy alone, followed by resection. The primary end points were event-free survival and pathological complete response (0% viable tumor in resected lung and lymph nodes), both evaluated by blinded independent review. Overall survival was a key secondary end point. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. The median event-free survival was 31.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.2 to not reached) with nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 20.8 months (95% CI, 14.0 to 26.7) with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio for disease progression, disease recurrence, or death, 0.63; 97.38% CI, 0.43 to 0.91; P = 0.005). The percentage of patients with a pathological complete response was 24.0% (95% CI, 18.0 to 31.0) and 2.2% (95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6), respectively (odds ratio, 13.94; 99% CI, 3.49 to 55.75; P<0.001). Results for event-free survival and pathological complete response across most subgroups favored nivolumab plus chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone. At the first prespecified interim analysis, the hazard ratio for death was 0.57 (99.67% CI, 0.30 to 1.07) and did not meet the criterion for significance. Of the patients who underwent randomization, 83.2% of those in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 75.4% of those in the chemotherapy-alone group underwent surgery. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 33.5% of the patients in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and in 36.9% of those in the chemotherapy-alone group. In patients with resectable NSCLC, neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer event-free survival and a higher percentage of patients with a pathological complete response than chemotherapy alone. The addition of nivolumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not increase the incidence of adverse events or impede the feasibility of surgery.

"Decitabine improves patient outcomes in myelodysplastic syndromes: results of a phase III randomized study. Aberrant DNA methylation, which results in leukemogenesis, is frequent in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is a potential target for pharmacologic therapy. Decitabine indirectly depletes methylcytosine and causes hypomethylation of target gene promoters. A total of 170 patients with MDS were randomized to receive either decitabine at a dose of 15 mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days (at a dose of 135 mg/m2 per course) and repeated every 6 weeks, or best supportive care. Response was assessed using the International Working Group criteria and required that response criteria be met for at least 8 weeks. Patients who were treated with decitabine achieved a significantly higher overall response rate (17%), including 9% complete responses, compared with supportive care (0%) (P < .001). An additional 12 patients who were treated with decitabine (13%) achieved hematologic improvement. Responses were durable (median, 10.3 mos) and were associated with transfusion independence. Patients treated with decitabine had a trend toward a longer median time to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) progression or death compared with patients who received supportive care alone (all patients, 12.1 mos vs. 7.8 mos [P = 0.16]; those with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2/high-risk disease, 12.0 mos vs. 6.8 mos [P = 0.03]; those with de novo disease, 12.6 mos vs. 9.4 mos [P = 0.04]; and treatment-naive patients, 12.3 mos vs. 7.3 mos [P = 0.08]). Decitabine was found to be clinically effective in the treatment of patients with MDS, provided durable responses, and improved time to AML transformation or death.

"Integrated data from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials of active cellular immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T in advanced prostate cancer. Sipuleucel-T is an investigational active cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate an immune response against prostate cancer. The safety and efficacy of sipuleucel-T was evaluated in 2 identically designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (D9901 and D9902A) conducted in men with advanced prostate cancer. A total of 225 patients were randomized in D9901 or D9902A to sipuleucel-T (n = 147) or placebo (n = 78), given as 3 intravenous infusions approximately 2 weeks apart. Patients were followed for survival until death or a prespecified cutoff of 36 months after randomization. In the integrated analysis of D9901 and D9902A, patients randomized to sipuleucel-T demonstrated a 33% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.05; P = .011; log-rank). The treatment effect remained strong after performing adjustments for imbalances in baseline prognostic factors, poststudy treatment chemotherapy use, and non-prostate cancer-related deaths. Additional support for the activity of sipuleucel-T is provided by the correlation between a measure of the product's potency, CD54 up-regulation, and overall survival. The most common adverse events associated with treatment were chills, pyrexia, headache, asthenia, dyspnea, vomiting, and tremor. These events were primarily grade 1 and 2, with durations of 1 to 2 days. The integrated results of D9901 and D9902A demonstrate a survival benefit for patients treated with sipuleucel-T compared with those treated with placebo. The generally modest toxicity profile, coupled with the survival benefit, suggests a favorable risk-benefit ratio for sipuleucel-T in patients with advanced prostate cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19536890/,19536890,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy compared to Placebo when used to treat Prostate cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy and Placebo for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy when compared with Placebo for Prostate cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy in comparison to Placebo for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy compared to Placebo for addressing Prostate cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy and Placebo in the treatment of Prostate cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy against Placebo for managing Prostate cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy compared to Placebo in treating Prostate cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy contrasted with Placebo in relation to Prostate cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy versus Placebo for treating Prostate cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy and Placebo in treating Prostate cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy as opposed to Placebo in managing Prostate cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy compared to Placebo in the context of Prostate cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Sipuleucel-T monotherapy compares to Placebo in terms of effectiveness for Prostate cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy in relation to Placebo for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy versus Placebo for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Placebo in treating Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Sipuleucel-T monotherapy against Placebo regarding Prostate cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00005947,"{""19536890"": ""Celestia S Higano|Paul F Schellhammer|Eric J Small|Patrick A Burch|John Nemunaitis|Lianng Yuh|Nicole Provost|Mark W Frohlich""}",1999-11,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Immunotherapy
"Durvalumab alone and durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (DANUBE): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial. Survival outcomes are poor for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who receive standard, first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy. We assessed the overall survival of patients who received durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor), with or without tremelimumab (a CTLA-4 inhibitor), as a first-line treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. DANUBE is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial in patients with untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, conducted at 224 academic research centres, hospitals, and oncology clinics in 23 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to receive durvalumab monotherapy (1500 mg) administered intravenously every 4 weeks; durvalumab (1500 mg) plus tremelimumab (75 mg) administered intravenously every 4 weeks for up to four doses, followed by durvalumab maintenance (1500 mg) every 4 weeks; or standard-of-care chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus carboplatin, depending on cisplatin eligibility) administered intravenously for up to six cycles. Randomisation was done through an interactive voice-web response system, with stratification by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 status, and presence or absence of liver metastases, lung metastases, or both. The coprimary endpoints were overall survival compared between the durvalumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy groups in the population of patients with high PD-L1 expression (the high PD-L1 population) and between the durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy groups in the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients). The study has completed enrolment and the final analysis of overall survival is reported. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02516241, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2015-001633-24. Between Nov 24, 2015, and March 21, 2017, we randomly assigned 1032 patients to receive durvalumab (n=346), durvalumab plus tremelimumab (n=342), or chemotherapy (n=344). At data cutoff (Jan 27, 2020), median follow-up for survival was 41·2 months (IQR 37·9-43·2) for all patients. In the high PD-L1 population, median overall survival was 14·4 months (95% CI 10·4-17·3) in the durvalumab monotherapy group (n=209) versus 12·1 months (10·4-15·0) in the chemotherapy group (n=207; hazard ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·71-1·11; p=0·30). In the intention-to-treat population, median overall survival was 15·1 months (13·1-18·0) in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group versus 12·1 months (10·9-14·0) in the chemotherapy group (0·85, 95% CI 0·72-1·02; p=0·075). In the safety population, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (14%) of 345 patients in the durvalumab group, 93 (27%) of 340 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group, and in 188 (60%) of 313 patients in the chemotherapy group. The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event was increased lipase in the durvalumab group (seven [2%] of 345 patients) and in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group (16 [5%] of 340 patients), and neutropenia in the chemotherapy group (66 [21%] of 313 patients). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 30 (9%) of 345 patients in the durvalumab group, 78 (23%) of 340 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group, and 50 (16%) of 313 patients in the chemotherapy group. Deaths due to study drug toxicity were reported in two (1%) patients in the durvalumab group (acute hepatic failure and hepatitis), two (1%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group (septic shock and pneumonitis), and one (<1%) patient in the chemotherapy group (acute kidney injury). This study did not meet either of its coprimary endpoints. Further research to identify the patients with previously untreated metastatic urothelial carcinoma who benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination regimens, is warranted.

"Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Previously Treated HER2-Positive Gastric Cancer. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor. The drug may have efficacy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. In an open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan as compared with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. Patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed while they were receiving at least two previous therapies, including trastuzumab, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks) or physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review. Secondary end points included overall survival, response duration, progression-free survival, confirmed response (response persisting ≥4 weeks), and safety. Of 187 treated patients, 125 received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 62 chemotherapy (55 received irinotecan and 7 paclitaxel). An objective response was reported in 51% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group, as compared with 14% of those in the physician's choice group (P<0.001). Overall survival was longer with trastuzumab deruxtecan than with chemotherapy (median, 12.5 vs. 8.4 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.88; P = 0.01, which crossed the prespecified O'Brien-Fleming boundary [0.0202 on the basis of number of deaths]). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 51% of the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 24% of the physician's choice group), anemia (38% and 23%, respectively), and decreased white-cell count (21% and 11%). A total of 12 patients had trastuzumab deruxtecan-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (grade 1 or 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 or 4 in 3), as adjudicated by an independent committee. One drug-related death (due to pneumonia) was noted in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group; no drug-related deaths occurred in the physician's choice group. Therapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan led to significant improvements in response and overall survival, as compared with standard therapies, among patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Myelosuppression and interstitial lung disease were the notable toxic effects.

"A Phase 2/3 Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Lenalidomide Versus Investigator's Choice in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. <b>Purpose:</b> Randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 2/3 trial investigating lenalidomide versus investigator's choice (IC) in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).<b>Experimental Design:</b> Patients with DLBCL who received ≥2 prior therapies were stratified by DLBCL subtype [germinal center B-cell (GCB) vs. non-GCB; determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)] and then randomized 1:1 to lenalidomide (25 mg/day, 21 days of 28-day cycle) or IC (gemcitabine, rituximab, etoposide, or oxaliplatin). Crossover to lenalidomide was permitted for IC-treated patients with radiologically confirmed progressive disease. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and subtype analysis [GCB vs. activated B-cell (ABC)] using gene expression profiling (GEP) were exploratory endpoints.<b>Results:</b> Stage 1: 102 DLBCL patients (by IHC: non-GCB, <i>n</i> = 54; GCB, <i>n</i> = 48) received ≥1 dose of lenalidomide or IC. Hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events with lenalidomide versus IC included neutropenia (42.6%; 36.4%), anemia (33.3%; 47.3%), thrombocytopenia (24.1%; 43.6%), and leukopenia (5.6%; 12.7%), respectively. Overall, lenalidomide-treated patients had an ORR of 27.5% versus 11.8% in IC (ORRs were similar regardless of IHC-defined DLBCL subtype). Median PFS was increased in patients receiving lenalidomide (13.6 weeks) versus IC (7.9 weeks; <i>P</i> = 0.041), with greater improvements in non-GCB patients (15.1 vs. 7.1 weeks, respectively; <i>P</i> = 0.021) compared with GCB (10.1 vs. 9.0 weeks, respectively; <i>P</i> = 0.550).<b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical benefit of lenalidomide monotherapy in DLBCL patients was more evident in the non-GCB subtype. Exploratory analyses suggest that this preferential benefit was more pronounced in the GEP-defined ABC population, demonstrating a need for additional studies of lenalidomide in DLBCL using GEP subtyping. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4127-37. ©2017 AACR</i>.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28381416/,28381416,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy when used to treat Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy versus Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy and Lenalidomide monotherapy for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy versus Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy when compared with Lenalidomide monotherapy for Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy in comparison to Lenalidomide monotherapy for the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy for addressing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy and Lenalidomide monotherapy in the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy against Lenalidomide monotherapy for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy contrasted with Lenalidomide monotherapy in relation to Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy versus Lenalidomide monotherapy for treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy and Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy as opposed to Lenalidomide monotherapy in managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy in the context of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how Etoposide monotherapy compares to Lenalidomide monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy in relation to Lenalidomide monotherapy for the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Etoposide monotherapy versus Lenalidomide monotherapy for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Etoposide monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Etoposide monotherapy against Lenalidomide monotherapy regarding Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01197560,"{""28381416"": ""Myron S Czuczman|Marek Trněný|Andrew Davies|Simon Rule|Kim M Linton|Nina Wagner-Johnston|Randy D Gascoyne|Graham W Slack|Pierre Brousset|David A Eberhard|Francisco J Hernandez-Ilizaliturri|Gilles Salles|Thomas E Witzig|Pier Luigi Zinzani|George W Wright|Louis M Staudt|Yandan Yang|P Mickey Williams|Chih-Jian Lih|Jacqueline Russo|Anjan Thakurta|Patrick Hagner|Pierre Fustier|Dale Song|Ian D Lewis""}",2010-09-02,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Immunomodulatory Drugs|Antimetabolites|Platinum-based Chemotherapy|Monoclonal Antibodies
"Randomized multicenter phase III study of a modified docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil regimen compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line therapy for advanced or locally recurrent gastric cancer. The V325 study showed that docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) prolonged overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced gastric cancer, but with a high incidence of dose-limiting toxicities. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a modified DCF (mDCF) regimen for Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer. Untreated advanced gastric cancer patients randomly received docetaxel and cisplatin at 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; mDCF regimen) or cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; CF) every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end points were OS, overall response rate (ORR), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), and safety. In total, 243 patients were randomized to treatment (mDCF regimen 121; CF 122). Compared with CF, the mDCF regimen significantly improved PFS and OS: the median PFS was 7.2 and 4.9 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, log-rank P = 0.0008], and the median OS was 10.2 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0319). Additionally, the mDCF regimen improved the parameters used as secondary objectives: the ORR was 48.7% with the mDCF regimen versus 33.9% with CF (P = 0.0244); the median TTF was 3.4 months with the mDCF regimen and 2.4 months with CF (HR = 0.67, P = 0.0027). Grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 77.3 % of patients who received the mDCF regimen versus 46.1% of patients who received CF (P < 0.001). The mDCF regimen, compared with CF, significantly prolonged PFS and OS and enhanced ORR of Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.

"Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus docetaxel significantly improves time to progression without additive cardiotoxicity compared with docetaxel monotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer previously treated with neoadjuvant-adjuvant anthracycline therapy: results from a randomized phase III study. To determine whether the combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and docetaxel significantly prolongs time to disease progression compared with docetaxel alone without an increase in cardiac toxicity in women with advanced breast cancer who had experienced relapse at least 1 year after prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant anthracycline therapy. This international, phase III study randomly assigned 751 patients to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) (n = 373) or PLD 30 mg/m(2) followed by docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) every 21 days (n = 378) and continued until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), cardiac toxicity, and safety.

"Rituximab purging and/or maintenance in patients undergoing autologous transplantation for relapsed follicular lymphoma: a prospective randomized trial from the lymphoma working party of the European group for blood and marrow transplantation. The objective of this randomized trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of rituximab as in vivo purging before transplantation and as maintenance treatment immediately after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (HDC-ASCT) in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL). Patients with relapsed FL who achieved either complete or very good partial remission with salvage chemotherapy were randomly assigned using a factorial design to rituximab purging (P+; 375 mg/m(2) once per week for 4 weeks) or observation (NP) before HDC-ASCT and to maintenance rituximab (M+; 375 mg/m(2) once every 2 months for four infusions) or observation (NM). From October 1999 to April 2006, 280 patients were enrolled. The median age was 51 years (range, 26 to 70 years), and baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. On average, patients were 44 months (range, 3 to 464 months) from diagnosis, with 79% having received two lines and 15% three lines of prior therapy. Median follow-up was 8.3 years. In contrast to purging, 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 48% for P+ and 42% for NP groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.11; P = .18); maintenance had a significant effect on PFS (10-year PFS, 54% for M+ and 37% for NM; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; P = .012). Overall survival (OS) was not improved by either rituximab purging or maintenance.

There was an advantage for MR regardless of Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score, tumor burden, residual disease, or histology. In multivariate analysis of MR patients, minimal disease after CVP was a favorable prognostic factor. OS at 3 years was 92% MR versus 86% OBS (HR = 0.6; log-rank one-sided P = .05) and, among patients with follicular lymphoma, OS was 91% MR versus 86% (HR = 0.6; log-rank one-sided P = .08). A trend favoring MR was observed among patients with high tumor burden (log-rank one-sided P = .03).

"Ipilimumab plus sargramostim vs ipilimumab alone for treatment of metastatic melanoma: a randomized clinical trial. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockade with ipilimumab prolongs survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. CTLA-4 blockade and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting tumor vaccine combinations demonstrate therapeutic synergy in preclinical models. A key unanswered question is whether systemic GM-CSF (sargramostim) enhances CTLA-4 blockade. To compare the effect of ipilimumab plus sargramostim vs ipilimumab alone on overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic melanoma. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a US-based phase 2 randomized clinical trial from December 28, 2010, until July 28, 2011, of patients (N = 245) with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, at least 1 prior therapy, no central nervous system metastases, and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized to receive ipilimumab, 10 mg/kg, intravenously on day 1 plus sargramostim, 250 μg subcutaneously, on days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle (n = 123) vs ipilimumab alone (n = 122). Ipilimumab treatment included induction for 4 cycles followed by maintenance every fourth cycle. Primary end point: comparison of length of OS. Secondary end point: progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, safety, and tolerability. Median follow-up was 13.3 months (range, 0.03-19.9). Median OS as of December 2012 for ipilimumab plus sargramostim was 17.5 months (95% CI, 14.9-not reached) vs 12.7 months (95% CI, 10.0-not reached) for ipilimumab. The 1-year survival rate for ipilimumab plus sargramostim was 68.9% (95% CI, 60.6%-85.5%) compared to 52.9% (95% CI, 43.6%-62.2%) for ipilimumab alone (stratified log-rank 1-sided P = .01; mortality hazard ratio 0.64 [1-sided 90% repeated CI, not applicable-0.90]). A planned interim analysis was conducted at 69.8% of expected events (104 observed with 149 expected deaths). Planned interim analysis using the O'Brien-Fleming boundary was crossed for improvement in OS. There was no difference in PFS. Median PFS for ipilimumab plus sargramostim was 3.1 months (95% CI, 2.9-4.6) vs 3.1 months (95% CI, 2.9-4.0) for ipilimumab alone. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in 44.9% (95% CI; 35.8%-54.4%) of patients in the ipilimumab plus sargramostim group vs 58.3% (95% CI, 49.0%-67.2%) of patients in the ipilimumab-alone group (2-sided P = .04). Among patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, treatment with ipilimumab plus sargramostim vs ipilimumab alone resulted in longer OS and lower toxicity, but no difference in PFS.

"Treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome patients with erythropoietin with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: results of a prospective randomized phase 3 trial by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (E1996). This phase 3 prospective randomized trial evaluated the efficacy and long-term safety of erythropoietin (EPO) with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus supportive care (SC; n = 53) versus SC alone (n = 57) for the treatment of anemic patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. The response rates in the EPO versus SC alone arms were 36% versus 9.6%, respectively, at the initial treatment step, 47% in the EPO arm, including subsequent steps. Responding patients had significantly lower serum EPO levels (45% vs 5% responses for levels < 200 mU/mL vs > or = 200 mU/mL) and improvement in multiple quality-of-life domains. With prolonged follow-up (median, 5.8 years), no differences were found in overall survival of patients in the EPO versus SC arms (median, 3.1 vs 2.6 years) or in the incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (7.5% and 10.5% patients, respectively). Increased survival was demonstrated for erythroid responders versus nonresponders (median, 5.5 vs 2.3 years). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of P-glycoprotein(+) CD34(+) marrow blasts was positively correlated with longer overall survival. In comparison with SC alone, patients receiving EPO with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus SC had improved erythroid responses, similar survival, and incidence of acute myeloid leukemia transformation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19564636/,19564636,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy compared to Best supportive care when used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy versus Best supportive care in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy and Best supportive care for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy versus Best supportive care in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy when compared with Best supportive care for Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy in comparison to Best supportive care for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy compared to Best supportive care for addressing Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy and Best supportive care in the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy against Best supportive care for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy compared to Best supportive care in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy contrasted with Best supportive care in relation to Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy versus Best supportive care for treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy and Best supportive care in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy as opposed to Best supportive care in managing Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy compared to Best supportive care in the context of Myelodysplastic syndrome.,What option most accurately summarizes how Epoetin monotherapy compares to Best supportive care in terms of effectiveness for Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy in relation to Best supportive care for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Epoetin monotherapy versus Best supportive care for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Epoetin monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Best supportive care in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Epoetin monotherapy against Best supportive care regarding Myelodysplastic syndrome.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003138,"{""19564636"": ""Peter L Greenberg|Zhuoxin Sun|Kenneth B Miller|John M Bennett|Martin S Tallman|Gordon Dewald|Elisabeth Paietta|Richard van der Jagt|Jessie Houston|Mary L Thomas|David Cella|Jacob M Rowe""}",1998-03-04,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Unknown
"Phase III clinical trial of thalidomide plus dexamethasone compared with dexamethasone alone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: a clinical trial coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. To determine if thalidomide plus dexamethasone yields superior response rates compared with dexamethasone alone as induction therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive thalidomide plus dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone. Patients in arm A received thalidomide 200 mg orally for 4 weeks; dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 40 mg orally on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. Patients in arm B received dexamethasone alone at the same schedule as in arm A. Two hundred seven patients were enrolled: 103 were randomly assigned to thalidomide plus dexamethasone and 104 were randomly assigned to dexamethasone alone; eight patients were ineligible. The response rate with thalidomide plus dexamethasone was significantly higher than with dexamethasone alone (63% v 41%, respectively; P = .0017). The response rate allowing for use of serum monoclonal protein levels when a measurable urine monoclonal protein was unavailable at follow-up was 72% v 50%, respectively. The incidence rates of grade 3 or higher deep vein thrombosis (DVT), rash, bradycardia, neuropathy, and any grade 4 to 5 toxicity in the first 4 months were significantly higher with thalidomide plus dexamethasone compared with dexamethasone alone (45% v 21%, respectively; P < .001). DVT was more frequent in arm A than in arm B (17% v 3%); grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy was also more frequent (7% v 4%, respectively).

"Phase III study of PSC-833 (valspodar) in combination with vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (valspodar/VAD) versus VAD alone in patients with recurring or refractory multiple myeloma (E1A95): a trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Preliminary studies have shown valspodar (PSC-833: Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ) to be a potent inhibitor of multidrug resistance (MDR), one cause of resistance to chemotherapy. An international randomized control study (Phase III) evaluated the use of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) with (n = 46) and without (n = 48) valspodar in the treatment of patients with recurring or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients with documented recurrence or refractory myeloma were stratified based on prior treatment exposure and creatinine and randomized. Because of interaction of valspodar with vincristine and doxorubicin, the doses of these drugs were reduced compared with the VAD-alone arm, and the doxorubicin was further reduced in the last 15 patients when given with valspodar based on pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies. There were no complete or near-complete responses. There were 29% partial responses (PRs) in the VAD-alone arm and 44% with valspodar (P = 0.2). Median progression-free survival was 7 months with VAD alone and 4.9 months with valspodar (P = 0.50). Subjective response was 19% with VAD alone and 17% with valspodar (P = 1.0). Median survival with VAD alone was 18.5 months and 15.3 with the addition of valspodar (P = 0.055). Toxicity of Grade 3 or greater was higher (P < 0.0001) in the valspodar arm (89%) compared with the VAD-alone arm (58%). The reduction of doxorubicin dose reduced toxicity but not significantly (P = 0.11). The addition of the MDR-modulating agent valspodar to VAD did not improve treatment outcome.

"Tipifarnib as maintenance therapy did not improve disease-free survival in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia at high risk of relapse: Results of the phase III randomized E2902 trial. Despite the achievement of complete remission with chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapse is common and the majority of patients will die of their disease. Patients who achieve a remission after refractory or relapsed disease as well as elderly patients have a very high rate of relapse even if they achieve a complete remission. A phase 3 randomized ECOG-ACRIN-led intergroup study was conducted to determine whether post-remission therapy with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, tipifarnib (R115777), improved the disease-free survival (DFS) of adult patients with AML in complete remission (CR), at high risk for relapse. Adult patients with AML in remission after salvage therapy and/or over age 60 in first remission were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned to treatment with tipifarnib or observation (control). The primary objective was to compare the disease-free survival (DFS) between the two arms based on intention to treat, which includes all randomized patients. One hundred and forty-four patients were enrolled on the study. Median DFS was 8.9 vs 5.3 months, for tipifarnib vs observation (one-sided p = 0.026) and did not cross the pre-specified boundary to call the study positive. For the 134 eligible patients, median DFS was 10.8 vs 5.3 months for those randomized to tipifarnib vs observation (one-sided p = 0.008). Moreover in an ad hoc evaluation of all women (n = 71) median DFS was 12.1 vs 3.9 months for tipifarnib vs observation (one-sided p = 0.0004) while median OS was 26.5 vs 8.4 months respectively (one-sided p = 0.001). This study was not able to demonstrate a benefit to tipifarnib as maintenance therapy in patients with AML in remission.

"Lenalidomide-Epoetin Alfa Versus Lenalidomide Monotherapy in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Refractory to Recombinant Erythropoietin. Impaired response to erythropoietin underlies ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We investigated whether treatment with lenalidomide (LEN), which augments erythropoietin receptor signaling in vitro, can restore and improve hemoglobin response to epoetin (EPO) alfa in patients with lower-risk, non-del(5q) MDS who have anemia that is refractory to or have low probability of benefit from treatment with recombinant erythropoietin. In a phase III, US intergroup trial, we randomly assigned patients to receive either LEN and EPO alfa or LEN alone following stratification by serum erythropoietin concentration and prior erythropoietin treatment. A total of 195 evaluable patients were randomly assigned: 99 patients to the LEN-EPO alfa cohort and 96 to LEN alone. After four cycles of treatment, the primary end point of major erythroid response (MER) was significantly higher (28.3%) with the combination compared with LEN alone (11.5%) (<i>P</i> = .004). Among 136 patients who completed 16 weeks of study treatment, 38.9% and 15.6% achieved MER, respectively (<i>P</i> = .004). Additionally, minor erythroid response was achieved in 18.2% and 20.8% of patients, for an overall erythroid response rate of 46.5% versus 32.3%.

"Bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer: results from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study E3200. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy improves survival in previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. This study was conducted to determine the effect of bevacizumab (at 10 mg/kg) on survival duration for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Eight hundred twenty-nine metastatic colorectal cancer patients previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) with bevacizumab; FOLFOX4 without bevacizumab; or bevacizumab alone. The primary end point was overall survival, with additional determinations of progression-free survival, response, and toxicity. The median duration of survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 and bevacizumab was 12.9 months compared with 10.8 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for death = 0.75; P = .0011), and 10.2 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The median progression-free survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 in combination with bevacizumab was 7.3 months, compared with 4.7 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for progression = 0.61; P < .0001), and 2.7 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The corresponding overall response rates were 22.7%, 8.6%, and 3.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for FOLFOX4 with bevacizumab v FOLFOX4 comparison).

"Phase III trial comparing concurrent biochemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, dacarbazine, interleukin-2, and interferon alfa-2b with cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine alone in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma (E3695): a trial coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Phase II trials with biochemotherapy (BCT) have shown encouraging response rates in metastatic melanoma, and meta-analyses and one phase III trial have suggested a survival benefit. In an effort to determine the relative efficacy of BCT compared with chemotherapy alone, a phase III trial was performed within the United States Intergroup. Patients were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (CVD) either alone or concurrent with interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2b (BCT). Treatment cycles were repeated at 21-day intervals for a maximum of four cycles. Tumor response was assessed after cycles 2 and 4, then every 3 months. Four hundred fifteen patients were enrolled, and 395 patients (CVD, n = 195; BCT, n = 200) were deemed eligible and assessable. The two study arms were well balanced for stratification factors and other prognostic factors. Response rate was 19.5% for BCT and 13.8% for CVD (P = .140). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer for BCT than for CVD (4.8 v 2.9 months; P = .015), although this did not translate into an advantage in either median overall survival (9.0 v 8.7 months) or the percentage of patients alive at 1 year (41% v 36.9%). More patients experienced grade 3 or worse toxic events with BCT than CVD (95% v 73%; P = .001). Although BCT produced slightly higher response rates and longer median progression-free survival than CVD alone, this was not associated with either improved overall survival or durable responses. Considering the extra toxicity and complexity, this concurrent BCT regimen cannot be recommended for patients with metastatic melanoma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19001327/,19001327,"Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) compared to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy when used to treat Melanoma.","Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) versus CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in treating Melanoma.","Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) and CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for managing Melanoma?","Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) versus CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in treating Melanoma.","Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) when compared with CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for Melanoma?","Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) in comparison to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for the treatment of Melanoma.","Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) compared to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for addressing Melanoma.","Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) and CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in the treatment of Melanoma?","Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) against CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for managing Melanoma.","Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) compared to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in treating Melanoma.","What option best characterizes the efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) contrasted with CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in relation to Melanoma?","Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) versus CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for treating Melanoma.","Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) and CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in treating Melanoma?","Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) as opposed to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in managing Melanoma.","Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) compared to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in the context of Melanoma.","What option most accurately summarizes how CVD (Vinblastine) compares to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Melanoma?","Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) in relation to CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for the treatment of Melanoma.","Which option best outlines the effectiveness of CVD (Vinblastine) versus CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy for managing Melanoma?","Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of CVD (Vinblastine)'s efficacy in comparison with CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy in treating Melanoma.","Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of CVD (Vinblastine) against CVD, IL-2, IFN alfa-2b - sequential biochemotherapy regarding Melanoma.",2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003027,"{""19001327"": ""Michael B Atkins|Jessie Hsu|Sandra Lee|Gary I Cohen|Lawrence E Flaherty|Jeffrey A Sosman|Vernon K Sondak|John M Kirkwood|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group""}",1997-11-13,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"Gemcitabine alone versus gemcitabine plus radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the role of radiation therapy with concurrent gemcitabine (GEM) compared with GEM alone in patients with localized unresectable pancreatic cancer. Patients with localized unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were randomly assigned to receive GEM alone (at 1,000 mg/m(2)/wk for weeks 1 to 6, followed by 1 week rest, then for 3 of 4 weeks) or GEM (600 mg/m(2)/wk for weeks 1 to 5, then 4 weeks later 1,000 mg/m(2) for 3 of 4 weeks) plus radiotherapy (starting on day 1, 1.8 Gy/Fx for total of 50.4 Gy). Measurement of quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary questionnaire was also performed. Of 74 patients entered on trial and randomly assigned to receive GEM alone (arm A; n = 37) or GEM plus radiation (arm B; n = 34), patients in arm B had greater incidence of grades 4 and 5 toxicities (41% v 9%), but grades 3 and 4 toxicities combined were similar (77% in A v 79% in B). No statistical differences were seen in quality of life measurements at 6, 15 to 16, and 36 weeks. The primary end point was survival, which was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.9 to 11.4 months) and 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 15.5 months) for arms A and B, respectively (one-sided P = .017 by stratified log-rank test).

"Rituximab-CHOP versus CHOP alone or with maintenance rituximab in older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. To address early and late treatment failures in older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we designed a two-stage randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) versus rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP), with a second random assignment to maintenance rituximab (MR) or observation in responding patients. Untreated DLBCL patients who were 60 years or older were randomly assigned to R-CHOP (n = 318) or CHOP (n = 314); 415 responders were randomly assigned to MR (n = 207) or observation (n = 208). The primary end point was failure-free survival (FFS). All P values were two sided. Three-year FFS rate was 53% for R-CHOP patients and 46% for CHOP patients (P = .04) at a median follow-up time of 3.5 years. Two-year FFS rate from second random assignment was 76% for MR compared with 61% for observation (P = .009). No significant differences in survival were seen according to induction or maintenance therapy. FFS was prolonged with MR after CHOP (P = .0004) but not after R-CHOP (P = .81) with 2-year FFS rates from second random assignment of 77%, 79%, 74%, and 45% for R-CHOP, R-CHOP + MR, CHOP + MR, and CHOP, respectively. In a secondary analysis excluding MR patients, R-CHOP alone reduced the risks of treatment failure (P = .003) and death (P = .05) compared with CHOP alone. Rituximab administered as induction or maintenance with CHOP chemotherapy significantly prolonged FFS in older DLBCL patients. After R-CHOP, no benefit was provided by MR. These results, which are consistent with an additive effect of rituximab, suggest that future studies could focus on maintenance strategies with novel agents as well as new induction therapies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16754935/,16754935,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of CHOP compared to R-CHOP when used to treat Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of CHOP versus R-CHOP in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of CHOP and R-CHOP for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of CHOP versus R-CHOP in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of CHOP when compared with R-CHOP for Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of CHOP in comparison to R-CHOP for the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of CHOP compared to R-CHOP for addressing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of CHOP and R-CHOP in the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of CHOP against R-CHOP for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of CHOP compared to R-CHOP in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of CHOP contrasted with R-CHOP in relation to Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of CHOP versus R-CHOP for treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of CHOP and R-CHOP in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of CHOP as opposed to R-CHOP in managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of CHOP compared to R-CHOP in the context of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how CHOP compares to R-CHOP in terms of effectiveness for Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of CHOP in relation to R-CHOP for the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of CHOP versus R-CHOP for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of CHOP's efficacy in comparison with R-CHOP in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of CHOP against R-CHOP regarding Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003150,"{""16754935"": ""Thomas M Habermann|Edie A Weller|Vicki A Morrison|Randy D Gascoyne|Peter A Cassileth|Jeffrey B Cohn|Shaker R Dakhil|Bruce Woda|Richard I Fisher|Bruce A Peterson|Sandra J Horning""}",1997-12,No,No,Unknown,Corticosteroids
"Phase III trial evaluating the addition of paclitaxel to doxorubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, as adjuvant or primary systemic therapy: European Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer. To evaluate the addition of paclitaxel to an anthracycline-based adjuvant regimen and to compare this combination with the same regimen given as primary systemic (neoadjuvant) therapy. A total of 1,355 women with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: surgery followed by adjuvant doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)) followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; arm A); surgery followed by adjuvant paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) plus doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)), followed by CMF (arm B); or paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) plus doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)) followed by CMF followed by surgery (arm C). The two coprimary objectives were to assess the effects on relapse-free survival (RFS) of the addition of paclitaxel to postoperative chemotherapy (arm B v arm A) and primary chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy (arm B v arm C). Doxorubicin plus paclitaxel followed by CMF was well-tolerated as adjuvant or as primary chemotherapy. The addition of paclitaxel to adjuvant doxorubicin followed by CMF significantly improved RFS compared with adjuvant doxorubicin alone followed by CMF (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; P = .03). Distant RFS was similarly improved (HR, 0.70; P = .027). There was no significant difference in RFS when the paclitaxel/doxorubicin/CMF chemotherapy was given before surgery compared with the same regimen given after surgery (HR, 1.21; P = .18). However, the rate of breast-conserving surgery was significantly higher with preoperative chemotherapy (63% v 34%; P < .001). Incorporating paclitaxel into anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy resulted in a significant improvement in RFS and distant RFS.

"Phase III study of iniparib plus gemcitabine and carboplatin versus gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. There is a lack of treatments providing survival benefit for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), with no standard of care. A randomized phase II trial showed significant benefit for gemcitabine, carboplatin, and iniparib (GCI) over gemcitabine and carboplatin (GC) in clinical benefit rate, response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Here, we formally compare the efficacy of these regimens in a phase III trial. Patients with stage IV/locally recurrent TNBC who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for mTNBC were randomly allocated to gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) and carboplatin area under the curve 2 (days 1 and 8) alone or GC plus iniparib 5.6 mg/kg (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) every 3 weeks. Random assignment was stratified by the number of prior chemotherapies. The coprimary end points were OS and PFS. Patients receiving GC could cross over to iniparib on progression. Five hundred nineteen patients were randomly assigned (261 GCI; 258 GC). In the primary analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.12; P = .28) nor PFS (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; P = .027).

"Oxaliplatin plus irinotecan compared with irinotecan alone as second-line treatment after single-agent fluoropyrimidine therapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. PURPOSE To determine whether irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (IROX) is superior to irinotecan alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) previously treated with single-agent fluoropyrimidines. PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients with metastatic or recurrent CRC that had progressed or recurred during or after adjuvant or first-line fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil/leucovorin or capecitabine, the latter only for metastatic CRC). Patients received IROX (irinotecan 200 mg/m(2) plus oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or irinotecan alone (350 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks. At the data cutoff (when 447 of 628 randomly assigned patients had died), median overall survival was 13.4 months (95% CI, 12.4 to 14.7 months) and 11.1 month (95% CI, 10.0 to 12.7 months) in the IROX and irinotecan groups, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.94; P = .0072). Overall response rate (22% v 7%, respectively; P < .0001), median time to progression (5.3 v 2.8 months, respectively; P < .0001), and improvement in tumor-related symptoms (32% v 19%, respectively; P = .0072) were also improved with IROX as compared with irinotecan. With the exception of granulocytopenia (25% v 13%), diarrhea (28% v 23%), and sensory disturbances (5% v 0%), grade 3 to 4 toxicities were comparable between the IROX and irinotecan groups, respectively. CONCLUSION IROX is an effective treatment for metastatic CRC that has progressed after first-line fluoropyrimidine therapy. IROX improves efficacy compared with irinotecan alone, providing an additional option in the postadjuvant or second-line treatment setting for patients who experience treatment failure with single-agent fluoropyrimidine therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18824706/,18824706,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy compared to IROX when used to treat Colorectal cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy versus IROX in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy and IROX for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy versus IROX in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy when compared with IROX for Colorectal cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy in comparison to IROX for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy compared to IROX for addressing Colorectal cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy and IROX in the treatment of Colorectal cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy against IROX for managing Colorectal cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy compared to IROX in treating Colorectal cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy contrasted with IROX in relation to Colorectal cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy versus IROX for treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy and IROX in treating Colorectal cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy as opposed to IROX in managing Colorectal cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy compared to IROX in the context of Colorectal cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Irinotecan monotherapy compares to IROX in terms of effectiveness for Colorectal cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy in relation to IROX for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Irinotecan monotherapy versus IROX for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Irinotecan monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with IROX in treating Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy against IROX regarding Colorectal cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00012389,"{""18824706"": ""Daniel G Haller|Mace L Rothenberg|Alfred O Wong|Piotr M Koralewski|Wilson H Miller|Gyorgy Bodoky|Nassir Habboubi|Carlos Garay|Luis O Olivatto""}",2000-12,No,No,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"Randomized trial of lapatinib versus placebo added to paclitaxel in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib is an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). This study is designed to test whether the addition of lapatinib to paclitaxel improves overall survival (OS) compared with placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III, randomized, double-blind study assessed the efficacy and safety of lapatinib plus paclitaxel compared with placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with newly diagnosed HER2-positive MBC. The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate, and safety. The addition of lapatinib to paclitaxel significantly improved OS versus paclitaxel (treatment hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = .0124); median OS was 27.8 versus 20.5 months, respectively. Median PFS was prolonged by 3.2 months, from 6.5 months with placebo plus paclitaxel to 9.7 months with lapatinib plus paclitaxel (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.64; stratified log-rank P < .001). ORR was significantly higher with lapatinib plus paclitaxel compared with placebo plus paclitaxel (69% v 50%, respectively; P < .001). The incidence of grades 3 and 4 diarrhea and neutropenia was higher in the lapatinib plus paclitaxel arm. Only 4% of patients in this group reported febrile neutropenia. Cardiac events were low grade, asymptomatic, and mostly reversible. The incidence of hepatic events was similar in both arms. There were no fatal adverse events in the lapatinib plus paclitaxel arm.

"Oral rivaroxaban for symptomatic venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide a simple, fixed-dose regimen for treating acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and for continued treatment, without the need for laboratory monitoring. We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, noninferiority study that compared oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study. The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.04; P<0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 594 in the placebo group, rivaroxaban had superior efficacy (8 events [1.3%], vs. 42 with placebo [7.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P<0.001). Four patients in the rivaroxaban group had nonfatal major bleeding (0.7%), versus none in the placebo group (P=0.11). Rivaroxaban offers a simple, single-drug approach to the short-term and continued treatment of venous thrombosis that may improve the benefit-to-risk profile of anticoagulation.

"Orteronel plus prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 months (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone.

"Chemotherapy plus lenalidomide versus autologous transplantation, followed by lenalidomide plus prednisone versus lenalidomide maintenance, in patients with multiple myeloma: a randomised, multicentre, phase 3 trial. High-dose melphalan plus autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard approach in transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. Our aims were to compare consolidation with high-dose melphalan plus ASCT versus chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone) plus lenalidomide, and maintenance with lenalidomide plus prednisone versus lenalidomide alone. We did an open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 study at 59 centres in Australia, Czech Republic, and Italy. We enrolled transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed myeloma aged 65 years or younger. Patients received a common induction with four 28-day cycles of lenalidomide (25 mg, days 1-21) and dexamethasone (40 mg, days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and subsequent chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (3 g/m(2)) followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for stem-cell mobilisation and collection. Using a 2 × 2 partial factorial design, we randomised patients to consolidation with either chemotherapy plus lenalidomide (six cycles of cyclophosphamide [300 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, and 15], dexamethasone [40 mg, days 1, 8, 15, and 22], and lenalidomide [25 mg, days 1-21]) or two courses of high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m(2)) and ASCT. We also randomised patients to maintenance with lenalidomide (10 mg, days 1-21) plus prednisone (50 mg, every other day) or lenalidomide alone. A simple randomisation sequence was used to assign patients at enrolment into one of the four groups (1:1:1:1 ratio), but the treatment allocation was disclosed only when the patient reached the end of the induction and confirmed their eligibility for consolidation. Both the patient and the treating clinician did not know the consolidation and maintenance arm until that time. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by intention-to-treat. The trial is ongoing and some patients are still receiving maintenance. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01091831. 389 patients were enrolled between July 6, 2009, and May 6, 2011, with 256 eligible for consolidation (127 high-dose melphalan and ASCT and 129 chemotherapy plus lenalidomide) and 223 eligible for maintenance (117 lenalidomide plus prednisone and 106 lenalidomide alone). Median follow-up was 52·0 months (IQR 30·4-57·6). Progression-free survival during consolidation was significantly shorter with chemotherapy plus lenalidomide compared with high-dose melphalan and ASCT (median 28·6 months [95% CI 20·6-36·7] vs 43·3 months [33·2-52·2]; hazard ratio [HR] for the first 24 months 2·51, 95% CI 1·60-3·94; p<0·0001). Progression-free survival did not differ between maintenance treatments (median 37·5 months [95% CI 27·8-not evaluable] with lenalidomide plus prednisone vs 28·5 months [22·5-46·5] with lenalidomide alone; HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·59-1·20; p=0·34). Fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded with chemotherapy plus lenalidomide than with high-dose melphalan and ASCT; the most frequent were haematological (34 [26%] of 129 patients vs 107 [84%] of 127 patients), gastrointestinal (six [5%] vs 25 [20%]), and infection (seven [5%] vs 24 [19%]). Haematological serious adverse events were reported in two (2%) patients assigned chemotherapy plus lenalidomide and no patients allocated high-dose melphalan and ASCT. Non-haematological serious adverse events were reported in 13 (10%) patients assigned chemotherapy plus lenalidomide and nine (7%) allocated high-dose melphalan and ASCT. During maintenance, adverse events did not differ between groups. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (nine [8%] of 117 patients assigned lenalidomide plus prednisone vs 14 [13%] of 106 allocated lenalidomide alone), infection (eight [8%] vs five [5%]), and systemic toxicities (seven [6%] vs two [2%]). Non-haematological serious adverse events were reported in 13 (11%) patients assigned lenalidomide plus prednisone versus ten (9%) allocated lenalidomide alone.

"Triplet vs doublet lenalidomide-containing regimens for the treatment of elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide-dexamethasone improved outcome in newly diagnosed elderly multiple myeloma patients. We randomly assigned 662 patients who were age ≥65 years or transplantation-ineligible to receive induction with melphalan-prednisone-lenalidomide (MPR) or cyclophosphamide-prednisone-lenalidomide (CPR) or lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in triplet (MPR and CPR) vs doublet (Rd) lenalidomide-containing regimens. After a median follow-up of 39 months, the median PFS was 22 months for the triplet combinations and 21 months for the doublet (P = .284). The median overall survival (OS) was not reached in either arms, and the 4-year OS was 67% for the triplet and 58% for the doublet arms (P = .709). By considering the 3 treatment arms separately, no difference in outcome was detected among MPR, CPR, and Rd. The most common grade ≥3 toxicity was neutropenia: 64% in MPR, 29% in CPR, and 25% in Rd patients (P < .0001). Grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicities were similar among arms and were mainly infections (6.5% to 11%), constitutional (3.5% to 9.5%), and cardiac (4.5% to 6%), with no difference among the arms. In conclusion, in the overall population, the alkylator-containing triplets MPR and CPR were not superior to the alkylator-free doublet Rd, which was associated with lower toxicity.

"Phase 3 study of nilotinib vs imatinib in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase: ENESTchina. Treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting BCR-ABL1 is currently the standard of care for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CML-CP). In this study, we present results of the ENESTchina (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-China) that was conducted to investigate nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs imatinib 400 mg once daily in a Chinese population. ENESTchina met its primary end point with a statistically significant higher rate of major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL1 ≤0.1% on the International Scale) at 12 months in the nilotinib arm vs the imatinib arm (52.2% vs 27.8%; P < .0001), and MMR rates remained higher with nilotinib vs imatinib throughout the follow-up period. Rates of complete cytogenetic response (0% Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] metaphases by standard cytogenetics) were comparable and ≥80% by 24 months in both arms. The estimated rate of freedom from progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis at 24 months was 95.4% in each arm. The safety profiles of both drugs were similar to those from previous studies.

"Randomized phase III study of cisplatin with or without raltitrexed in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: an intergroup study of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lung Cancer Group and the National Cancer Institute of Canada. We conducted a phase III trial to determine whether first-line treatment with raltitrexed, a thymidine synthase inhibitor, and cisplatin results in superior outcome compared with cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Eligible patients with histologically proven advanced MPM, not pretreated with chemotherapy, WHO performance status (PS) 0 to 2, and adequate hematological, renal, and hepatic function were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV on day 1, alone (arm A) or combined with raltitrexed 3 mg/m2 (arm B). In patients with measurable disease, response was monitored using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Health related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and Lung Module (QLQ-LC13). Two hundred fifty patients were randomized: 80% male; median age, 58 years; and WHO PS, 0, 1, 2 in 25, 62, and 13% of cases, respectively. There were no toxic deaths. The main grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed were neutropenia and emesis, reported twice as often in the combination arm. Among 213 patients with measurable disease, response rate was 13.6% (arm A) versus 23.6% (arm B; P = .056). No difference in HRQOL was observed on any of the scales. Median overall and 1-year survival in arms A and B were 8.8 (95% CI, 7.8 to 10.8) v 11.4 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 15), respectively, and 40% v 46%, respectively (P = .048).

"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive small-cell lung cancer. We conducted a randomized trial of prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer who had had a response to chemotherapy. Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years with extensive small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation (irradiation group) or receive no further therapy (control group). The primary end point was the time to symptomatic brain metastases. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed when any predefined key symptom suggestive of brain metastases was present. The two groups (each with 143 patients) were well balanced regarding baseline characteristics. Patients in the irradiation group had a lower risk of symptomatic brain metastases (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16 to 0.44; P<0.001). The cumulative risk of brain metastases within 1 year was 14.6% in the irradiation group (95% CI, 8.3 to 20.9) and 40.4% in the control group (95% CI, 32.1 to 48.6). Irradiation was associated with an increase in median disease-free survival from 12.0 weeks to 14.7 weeks and in median overall survival from 5.4 months to 6.7 months after randomization. The 1-year survival rate was 27.1% (95% CI, 19.4 to 35.5) in the irradiation group and 13.3% (95% CI, 8.1 to 19.9) in the control group. Irradiation had side effects but did not have a clinically significant effect on global health status. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolongs disease-free and overall survival.

"Randomized phase III study comparing paclitaxel-bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) to standard BEP in intermediate-prognosis germ-cell cancer: intergroup study EORTC 30983. To compare the efficacy of four cycles of paclitaxel-bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (T-BEP) to four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) in previously untreated patients with intermediate-prognosis germ-cell cancer (GCC). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either T-BEP or standard BEP. Patients assigned to the T-BEP group received paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) in a 3-hour infusion. Patients who were administered T-BEP received primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis. The study was designed as a randomized open-label phase II/III study. To show a 10% improvement in 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), the study aimed to recruit 498 patients but closed with 337 patients as a result of slow accrual. Accrual was from November 1998 to April 2009. A total of 169 patients were administered BEP, and 168 patients were administered T-BEP. Thirteen patients in both arms were ineligible, mainly as a result of a good prognosis of GCC (eight patients administered BEP; six patients administered T-BEP) or a poor prognosis of GCC (one patient administered BEP; four patients administered T-BEP). PFS at 3 years (intent to treat) was 79.4% in the T-BEP group versus 71.1% in the BEP group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; CI, 0.47 to 1.13; P [log-rank test] = 0.153). PFS at 3 years in all eligible patients was 82.7% versus 70.1%, respectively (HR, 0.60; CI: 0.37 to 0.97) and was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Overall survival was not statistically different. T-BEP administered with G-CSF seems to be a safe and effective treatment regimen for patients with intermediate-prognosis GCC. However, the study recruited a smaller-than-planned number of patients and included 7.7% ineligible patients. The primary analysis of the trial could not demonstrate statistical superiority of T-BEP for PFS. When ineligible patients were excluded, the analysis of all eligible patients demonstrated a 12% superior 3-year PFS with T-BEP, which was statistically significant.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22271474/,22271474,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of BEP compared to T-BEP when used to treat Testicular cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of BEP versus T-BEP in treating Testicular cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of BEP and T-BEP for managing Testicular cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of BEP versus T-BEP in treating Testicular cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of BEP when compared with T-BEP for Testicular cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of BEP in comparison to T-BEP for the treatment of Testicular cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of BEP compared to T-BEP for addressing Testicular cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of BEP and T-BEP in the treatment of Testicular cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of BEP against T-BEP for managing Testicular cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of BEP compared to T-BEP in treating Testicular cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of BEP contrasted with T-BEP in relation to Testicular cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of BEP versus T-BEP for treating Testicular cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of BEP and T-BEP in treating Testicular cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of BEP as opposed to T-BEP in managing Testicular cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of BEP compared to T-BEP in the context of Testicular cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how BEP compares to T-BEP in terms of effectiveness for Testicular cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of BEP in relation to T-BEP for the treatment of Testicular cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of BEP versus T-BEP for managing Testicular cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of BEP's efficacy in comparison with T-BEP in treating Testicular cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of BEP against T-BEP regarding Testicular cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003643,"{""22271474"": ""Ronald de Wit|Iwona Skoneczna|Gedske Daugaard|Maria De Santis|August Garin|Nina Aass|Alfred J Witjes|Peter Albers|Jeffery D White|José R Germa-Lluch|Sandrine Marreaud|Laurence Collette""}",1998-10,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy|Taxanes
"Randomized phase III study comparing paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabine and gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer without prior systemic therapy: EORTC Intergroup Study 30987. The combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) is a standard regimen in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. A phase I/II study suggested that a three-drug regimen that included paclitaxel had greater antitumor activity and might improve survival. We conducted a randomized phase III study to compare paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabine (PCG) with GC in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate, and toxicity. From 2001 to 2004, 626 patients were randomly assigned; 312 patients were assigned to PCG, and 314 patients were assigned to GC. After a median follow-up of 4.6 years, the median OS was 15.8 months on PCG versus 12.7 months on GC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; P = .075). OS in the subgroup of all eligible patients was significantly longer on PCG (3.2 months; HR, 0.82; P = .03), as was the case in patients with bladder primary tumors.

"Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation in early-stage Hodgkin's disease. Treatment of early-stage Hodgkin's disease is usually tailored in line with prognostic factors that allow for reductions in the amount of chemotherapy and extent of radiotherapy required for a possible cure. From 1993 to 1999, we identified 1538 patients (age, 15 to 70 years) who had untreated stage I or II supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin's disease with favorable prognostic features (the H8-F trial) or unfavorable features (the H8-U trial). In the H8-F trial, we compared three cycles of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) combined with doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (ABV) plus involved-field radiotherapy with subtotal nodal radiotherapy alone (reference group). In the H8-U trial, we compared three regimens: six cycles of MOPP-ABV plus involved-field radiotherapy (reference group), four cycles of MOPP-ABV plus involved-field radiotherapy, and four cycles of MOPP-ABV plus subtotal nodal radiotherapy. The median follow-up was 92 months. In the H8-F trial, the estimated 5-year event-free survival rate was significantly higher after three cycles of MOPP-ABV plus involved-field radiotherapy than after subtotal nodal radiotherapy alone (98% vs. 74%, P<0.001). The 10-year overall survival estimates were 97% and 92%, respectively (P=0.001). In the H8-U trial, the estimated 5-year event-free survival rates were similar in the three treatment groups: 84% after six cycles of MOPP-ABV plus involved-field radiotherapy, 88% after four cycles of MOPP-ABV plus involved-field radiotherapy, and 87% after four cycles of MOPP-ABV plus subtotal nodal radiotherapy. The 10-year overall survival estimates were 88%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiotherapy should be the standard treatment for Hodgkin's disease with favorable prognostic features. In patients with unfavorable features, four courses of chemotherapy plus involved-field radiotherapy should be the standard treatment.

"Comparison of 36 Gy, 20 Gy, or No Radiation Therapy After 6 Cycles of EBVP Chemotherapy and Complete Remission in Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma Without Risk Factors: Results of the EORT-GELA H9-F Intergroup Randomized Trial. While patients with early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) have an excellent outcome with combined treatment, the radiation therapy (RT) dose and treatment with chemotherapy alone remain questionable. This noninferiority trial evaluates the feasibility of reducing the dose or omitting RT after chemotherapy. Patients with untreated supradiaphragmatic HL without risk factors (age ≥ 50 years, 4 to 5 nodal areas involved, mediastinum-thoracic ratio ≥ 0.35, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥ 50 mm in first hour without B symptoms or erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥ 30 mm in first hour with B symptoms) were eligible for the trial. Patients in complete remission after chemotherapy were randomized to no RT, low-dose RT (20 Gy in 10 fractions), or standard-dose involved-field RT (36 Gy in 18 fractions). The limit of noninferiority was 10% for the difference between 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) estimates. From September 1998 to May 2004, 783 patients received 6 cycles of epirubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and prednisone; 592 achieved complete remission or unconfirmed complete remission, of whom 578 were randomized to receive 36 Gy (n=239), 20 Gy of involved-field RT (n=209), or no RT (n=130). Randomization to the no-RT arm was prematurely stopped (≥20% rate of inacceptable events: toxicity, treatment modification, early relapse, or death). Results in the 20-Gy arm (5-year RFS, 84.2%) were not inferior to those in the 36-Gy arm (5-year RFS, 88.6%) (difference, 4.4%; 90% confidence interval [CI] -1.2% to 9.9%). A difference of 16.5% (90% CI 8.0%-25.0%) in 5-year RFS estimates was observed between the no-RT arm (69.8%) and the 36-Gy arm (86.3%); the hazard ratio was 2.55 (95% CI 1.44-4.53; P<.001). The 5-year overall survival estimates ranged from 97% to 99%. In adult patients with early-stage HL without risk factors in complete remission after epirubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and prednisone chemotherapy, the RT dose may be limited to 20 Gy without compromising disease control.

"High-dose cytarabine in induction treatment improves the outcome of adult patients younger than age 46 years with acute myeloid leukemia: results of the EORTC-GIMEMA AML-12 trial. Cytarabine plays a pivotal role in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Most centers use 7 to 10 days of cytarabine at a daily dose of 100 to 200 mg/m(2) for remission induction. Consensus has not been reached on the benefit of higher dosages of cytarabine. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell' Adulto (GIMEMA) Leukemia Groups conducted a randomized trial (AML-12; Combination Chemotherapy, Stem Cell Transplant and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia) in 1,942 newly diagnosed patients with AML, age 15 to 60 years, comparing remission induction treatment containing daunorubicin, etoposide, and either standard-dose (SD) cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day by continuous infusion for 10 days) or high-dose (HD) cytarabine (3,000 mg/m(2) every 12 hours by 3-hour infusion on days 1, 3, 5, and 7). Patients in complete remission (CR) received a single consolidation cycle containing daunorubicin and intermediate-dose cytarabine (500 mg/m(2) every 12 hours for 6 days). Subsequently, a stem-cell transplantation was planned. The primary end point was survival. At a median follow-up of 6 years, overall survival was 38.7% for patients randomly assigned to SD cytarabine and 42.5% for those randomly assigned to HD cytarabine (log-rank test P = .06; multivariable analysis P = .009). For patients younger than age 46 years, survival was 43.3% and 51.9%, respectively (P = .009; multivariable analysis P = .003), and for patients age 46 to 60 years, survival was 33.9% and 32.9%, respectively (P = .91). CR rates were 72.0% and 78.7%, respectively (P < .001) and were 75.6% and 82.4% for patients younger than age 46 years (P = .01) and 68.3% and 74.8% for patients age 46 years and older (P = .03). Patients of all ages with very-bad-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and/or FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutation, or with secondary AML benefitted from HD cytarabine.

"Sequential combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and standard chemotherapy in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia: results of a randomized phase III trial by the EORTC and GIMEMA consortium (AML-17). This randomized trial evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of sequential gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) and standard chemotherapy in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients (n = 472) age 61 to 75 years were randomly assigned to induction chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, cytarabine, and etoposide preceded, or not, by a course of GO (6 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15). In remission, patients received two consolidation courses with or without GO (3 mg/m(2) on day 0). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The overall response rate was comparable between the two arms (GO, 45%; no GO, 49%), but induction and 60-day mortality rates were higher in the GO arm (17% v 12% and 22% v 18%, respectively).

Other survival end points were similar in both arms. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic and liver toxicities were greater in the GO arm. Treatment with GO provided no benefit in any prognostic subgroup, with the possible exception of patients age < 70 years with secondary AML, but outcomes were significantly worse in the oldest age subgroup because of a higher risk of early mortality. As used in this trial, the sequential combination of GO and standard chemotherapy provides no benefit for older patients with AML and is too toxic for those age ≥ 70 years.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24127442/,24127442,"Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC compared to MEC when used to treat Acute myeloid leukemia.","Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC versus MEC in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.","Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC and MEC for managing Acute myeloid leukemia?","Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC versus MEC in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.","Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC when compared with MEC for Acute myeloid leukemia?","Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC in comparison to MEC for the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia.","Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC compared to MEC for addressing Acute myeloid leukemia.","Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC and MEC in the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia?","Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC against MEC for managing Acute myeloid leukemia.","Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC compared to MEC in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.","What option best characterizes the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC contrasted with MEC in relation to Acute myeloid leukemia?","Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC versus MEC for treating Acute myeloid leukemia.","Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC and MEC in treating Acute myeloid leukemia?","Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC as opposed to MEC in managing Acute myeloid leukemia.","Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC compared to MEC in the context of Acute myeloid leukemia.","What option most accurately summarizes how Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC compares to MEC in terms of effectiveness for Acute myeloid leukemia?","Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC in relation to MEC for the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia.","Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC versus MEC for managing Acute myeloid leukemia?","Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC's efficacy in comparison with MEC in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.","Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin monotherapy, then MEC against MEC regarding Acute myeloid leukemia.",2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00052299,"{""24127442"": ""Sergio Amadori|Stefan Suciu|Roberto Stasi|Helmut R Salih|Dominik Selleslag|Petra Muus|Paolo De Fabritiis|Adriano Venditti|Anthony D Ho|Michael Lübbert|Xavier Thomas|Roberto Latagliata|Constantijn J M Halkes|Franca Falzetti|Domenico Magro|José E Guimaraes|Zwi Berneman|Giorgina Specchia|Matthias Karrasch|Paola Fazi|Marco Vignetti|Roel Willemze|Theo de Witte|Jean-Pierre Marie""}",2002-09,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Monoclonal Antibodies
"Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Versus Best Supportive Care in Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Unsuitable for Intensive Chemotherapy: Results of the Randomized Phase III EORTC-GIMEMA AML-19 Trial. To compare single-agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) with best supportive care (BSC) including hydroxyurea as first-line therapy in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. In this trial, patients at least 61 years old were centrally randomized (1:1) to receive either a single induction course of GO (6 mg/m(2) on day 1 and 3 mg/m(2) on day 8) or BSC. Patients who did not progress after GO induction could receive up to eight monthly infusions of the immunoconjugate at 2 mg/m(2). Randomization was stratified by age, WHO performance score, CD33 expression status, and center. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) by intention-to-treat analysis. A total of 237 patients were randomly assigned (118 to GO and 119 to BSC). The median OS was 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.8 months) in the GO group and 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.6 to 4.2 months) in the BSC group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.90; P = .005); the 1-year OS rate was 24.3% with GO and 9.7% with BSC. The OS benefit with GO was consistent across most subgroups, and was especially apparent in patients with high CD33 expression status, in those with favorable/intermediate cytogenetic risk profile, and in women. Overall, complete remission (CR [complete remission] + CRi [CR with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts]) occurred in 30 of 111 (27%) GO recipients. The rates of serious adverse events (AEs) were similar in the two groups, and no excess mortality from AEs was observed with GO. First-line monotherapy with low-dose GO, as compared with BSC, significantly improved OS in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

Clinical trials and meta-analyses have suggested that aspirin may be effective for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) after total hip or total knee arthroplasty, but comparisons with direct oral anticoagulants are lacking for prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge. We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients who were undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. All the patients received once-daily oral rivaroxaban (10 mg) until postoperative day 5 and then were randomly assigned to continue rivaroxaban or switch to aspirin (81 mg daily) for an additional 9 days after total knee arthroplasty or for 30 days after total hip arthroplasty. Patients were followed for 90 days for symptomatic venous thromboembolism (the primary effectiveness outcome) and bleeding complications, including major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (the primary safety outcome). A total of 3424 patients (1804 undergoing total hip arthroplasty and 1620 undergoing total knee arthroplasty) were enrolled in the trial.

Major bleeding complications occurred in 8 patients (0.47%) in the aspirin group and in 5 (0.29%) in the rivaroxaban group (difference, 0.18 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.65 to 0.29; P=0.42). Clinically important bleeding occurred in 22 patients (1.29%) in the aspirin group and in 17 (0.99%) in the rivaroxaban group (difference, 0.30 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.07 to 0.47; P=0.43). Among patients who received 5 days of rivaroxaban prophylaxis after total hip or total knee arthroplasty, extended prophylaxis with aspirin was not significantly different from rivaroxaban in the prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism.

"Ponatinib versus imatinib for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia: an international, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Ponatinib has shown potent activity against chronic myeloid leukaemia that is resistant to available treatment, although it is associated with arterial occlusion. We investigated whether this activity and safety profile would result in superior outcomes compared with imatinib in previously untreated patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The Evaluation of Ponatinib versus Imatinib in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (EPIC) study was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ponatinib, compared with imatinib, in newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. Patients from 106 centres in 21 countries were randomly assigned (1:1, with stratification by Sokal score at diagnosis) using an interactive voice and web response system to receive oral ponatinib (45 mg) or imatinib (400 mg) once daily until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal were met. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age, within 6 months of diagnosis, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive by cytogenetic assessment, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had not previously been treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The primary endpoint was major molecular response at 12 months. Patients who remained on study and had molecular assessments at specified timepoints were studied at those timepoints. Safety analyses included all treated patients, as per study protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01650805. Between Aug 14, 2012, and Oct 9, 2013, 307 patients were randomly assigned to receive ponatinib (n=155) or imatinib (n=152). The trial was terminated early, on Oct 17, 2013, following concerns about vascular adverse events observed in patients given ponatinib in other trials. Trial termination limited assessment of the primary endpoint of major molecular response at 12 months, as only 13 patients in the imatinib group and ten patients in the ponatinib group could be assessed at this timepoint; the proportion of patients achieving a major molecular response at 12 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (eight [80%] of ten patients given ponatinib and five [38%] of 13 patients given imatinib; p=0·074). 11 (7%) of 154 patients given ponatinib and three (2%) of 152 patients given imatinib had arterial occlusive events (p=0·052); arterial occlusive events were designated serious in ten (6%) of 154 patients given ponatinib and in one (1%) of 152 patients given imatinib (p=0·010). The data monitoring committee criterion for risk assessment (significant difference in serious grade 3 or 4 ischaemic events between groups) was not met (five [3%] of 154 vs one [1%] of 152; p=0·21). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events observed in more than 5% of patients in the ponatinib group were increased lipase (22 [14%] of 154 vs three [2%] of 152 with imatinib), thrombocytopenia (19 [12%] of 154 vs ten [7%] of 152 with imatinib), rash (ten [6%] of 154 vs two [1%] of 152 with imatinib). In the imatinib group, grade 3 or 4 adverse events observed in more than 5% of patients were neutropenia (12 [8%] of 152 vs five [3%] of 154 with ponatinib) and thrombocytopenia (ten [7%] of 152 vs 19 [12%] of 154 with ponatinib). Serious adverse events that occurred in three or more patients given ponatinib were pancreatitis (n=5), atrial fibrillation (n=3), and thrombocytopenia (n=3). No serious adverse event occurred in three or more patients given imatinib. The efficacy of ponatinib treatment of newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia compared with imatinib could not be assessed due to trial termination, but preliminary data suggest there might be benefit, although with more arterial occlusive events than with imatinib at the doses studied. Because the EPIC trial was terminated early, efficacy of ponatinib in this setting remains to be established.

"A phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy and safety of epoetin-α in anemic patients with low-risk MDS. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are first choice for treating anemia in low-risk MDS. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and safety of epoetin-α in IPSS low- or intermediate-1 risk (i.e., low-risk) MDS patients with Hb ≤ 10.0 g/dL, with no or moderate RBC transfusion dependence (≤4 RBC units/8 weeks). Patients were randomized, 2:1, to receive epoetin-α 450 IU/kg/week or placebo for 24 weeks, followed by treatment extension in responders. The primary endpoint was erythroid response (ER) through Week 24. Dose adjustments were driven by weekly Hb-levels and included increases, and dose reductions/discontinuation if Hb > 12 g/dL. An independent Response Review Committee (RRC) blindly reviewed all responses, applying IWG-2006 criteria but also considering dose adjustments, drug interruptions and longer periods of observation.A total of 130 patients were randomized (85 to epoetin-α and 45 to placebo). The ER by IWG-2006 criteria was 31.8% for epoetin-α vs 4.4% for placebo (p < 0.001); after RRC review, the ER was 45.9 vs 4.4% (p < 0.001), respectively. Epoetin-α reduced RBC transfusions and increased the time-to-first-transfusion compared with placebo.Thus, epoetin-α significantly improved anemia outcomes in low-risk MDS.

"Camrelizumab versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy as second-line therapy for advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCORT): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study. Patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma have poor prognosis and few treatment options after first-line therapy. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in previously treated patients. ESCORT is a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study of patients aged 18 to 75 years with a histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma done at 43 hospitals in China. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and had progressed on, or were intolerant to, first-line standard therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to camrelizumab (200 mg every 2 weeks) or chemotherapy with docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks) or irinotecan (180 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 2 weeks), all given intravenously. Central randomisation was done using the Randomization and Trial Supply Management system with block size randomly generated as four or six and stratified by disease and ECOG performance status. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in randomised patients who had received at least one dose of treatment. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03099382, and is closed to new participants. From May 10, 2017, to July 24, 2018, 457 (75%) of 607 screened patients were randomly assigned to treatment, of whom 228 received camrelizumab treatment and 220 received chemotherapy. As of data cutoff on May 6, 2019, with a median follow-up time of 8·3 months (IQR 4·1-12·8) in the camrelizumab group and 6·2 months (3·6-10·1) in the chemotherapy group, median overall survival was 8·3 months (95% CI 6·8-9·7) in the camrelizumab group and 6·2 months (5·7-6·9) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·71 [95% CI 0·57-0·87]; two-sided p=0·0010). The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were anaemia (camrelizumab vs chemotherapy: six [3%] vs 11 [5%]), abnormal hepatic function (four [2%] vs one [<1%]), and diarrhoea (three [1%] vs nine [4%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 37 (16%) of 228 patients in the camrelizumab group, and in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy group. Ten treatment-related deaths occurred, seven (3%) in the camrelizumab group (three deaths from unknown causes, one enterocolitis, one hepatic function abnormal, one pneumonitis, and one myocarditis) and three (1%) in the chemotherapy group (two deaths from unknown causes, and one gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Second-line camrelizumab significantly improved overall survival in patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma compared with chemotherapy, with a manageable safety profile. It might represent a potential option of standard second-line treatment for patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in China.

"Irinotecan plus S-1 versus S-1 in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer (ESWN 01): a prospective randomized, multicenter, open-labeled phase 3 trial. The benefit of systemic treatments in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) which has progressed after chemotherapy is still uncertain and optimal regimens based on randomized trials have not yet been established. We aimed to compare the efficacy of irinotecan plus S-1 with S-1 monotherapy in recurrent or metastatic ESCC patients who had resistance to platinum- or taxane-based chemotherapy. We conducted a prospective randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial in 15 centers across China. Eligible patients were adults with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic ESCC, and were randomly assigned (ratio, 1:1) to receive either irinotecan plus S-1 (intravenous infusion of irinotecan [160 mg/m<sup>2</sup>] on day 1 and oral S-1 [80-120 mg] on days 1-10, repeated every 14 days) or oral S-1 monotherapy (80-120 mg/day on days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) using a central computerized minimization procedure. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Between December 23, 2014 and July 25, 2016, we screened 148 patients and randomly assigned 123 patients to receive either irinotecan plus S-1 regimen (n = 61) or S-1 monotherapy (n = 62). After a median follow-up of 29.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.5-40.9 months), the median PFS was significantly longer in the irinotecan plus S-1 group than in the S-1 monotherapy group (3.8 months [95% CI 2.9-4.3 months] vs. 1.7 months [95% CI 1.4-2.7 months], hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.86, P = 0.006). The objective response rates were 24.6% in the irinotecan plus S-1 group and 9.7% in the S-1 monotherapy group (P = 0.002). The patients in the irinotecan plus S-1 group presented with increased rates of grade 3-4 leukopenia (16.4% vs. 0%), neutropenia (14.8% vs. 1.6%), and nausea (4.9% vs. 0%). No significant difference in grade 3-4 diarrhea and no treatment-related deaths were observed in both groups. The combination of irinotecan with S-1 was similarly tolerable but significantly prolonged PFS compared to S-1 monotherapy as a second- or third-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC.

"Erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EURTAC): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial. Erlotinib has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy when given as first-line treatment for Asian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC. We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain. Eligible participants were adults (> 18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending ≥ 6 months before study entry was allowed). We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8). Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2)) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (≥ 1 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225. Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled. One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy. The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended. At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9·7 months (95% CI 8·4-12·3) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5·2 months (4·5-5·8) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·37, 95% CI 0·25-0·54; p < 0·0001). Main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (11 [13%] of 84 patients given erlotinib vs none of 82 patients in the chemotherapy group), neutropenia (none vs 18 [22%]), anaemia (one [1%] vs three [4%]), and increased amino-transferase concentrations (two [2%] vs 0). Five (6%) patients on erlotinib had treatment-related severe adverse events compared with 16 patients (20%) on chemotherapy.

"Extended-duration venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients with recently reduced mobility: a randomized trial. Extended-duration low-molecular-weight heparin has been shown to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-duration enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. Randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization was computer-generated. Allocation was centralized. Patients, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00077753) SETTING: 370 sites in 20 countries across North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Acutely ill medical patients 40 years or older with recently reduced mobility (bed rest or sedentary without [level 1] or with [level 2] bathroom privileges). Eligibility criteria for patients with level 2 immobility were amended to include only those who had additional VTE risk factors (age >75 years, history of VTE, or active or previous cancer) after interim analyses suggested lower-than-expected VTE rates. Enoxaparin, 40 mg/d subcutaneously (2975 patients), or placebo (2988 patients), for 28 +/- 4 days after receiving open-label enoxaparin for an initial 10 +/- 4 days. Incidence of VTE up to day 28 and of major bleeding events up to 48 hours after the last study treatment dose. Extended-duration enoxaparin reduced VTE incidence compared with placebo (2.5% vs. 4%; absolute risk difference favoring enoxaparin, -1.53% [95.8% CI, -2.54% to -0.52%]). Enoxaparin increased major bleeding events (0.8% vs. 0.3%; absolute risk difference favoring placebo, 0.51% [95% CI, 0.12% to 0.89%]). The benefits of extended-duration enoxaparin seemed to be restricted to women, patients older than 75 years, and those with level 1 immobility. Estimates of efficacy and safety for the overall trial population are difficult to interpret because of the change in eligibility criteria during the trial. Use of extended-duration enoxaparin reduces VTE more than it increases major bleeding events in acutely ill medical patients with level 1 immobility, those older than 75 years, and women.

"XELOX doublet regimen versus EOX triplet regimen as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer: An open-labeled, multicenter, randomized, prospective phase III trial (EXELOX). There is no consensus on whether triplet regimen is better than doublet regimen in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC). We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin plus capecitabine (XELOX) and epirubicin, oxaliplatin, plus capecitabine (EOX) regimens in treating AGC. This phase III trial enrolled previously untreated patients with AGC who were randomly assigned to receive the XELOX or EOX regimen. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority in progression-free survival (PFS) for XELOX as compared with EOX on an intention-to-treat basis. Between April 10, 2015 and August 20, 2020, 448 AGC patients were randomized to receive XELOX (n = 222) or EOX (n = 226). The median PFS (mPFS) was 5.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.5-6.0 months) in the XELOX arm and 5.5 months (95% CI = 5.0-6.0 months) in the EOX arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.989, 95% CI = 0.812-1.203; P<sub>non-inferiority</sub> = 0.003). There was no significant difference in median overall survival (mOS) (12.0 vs. 12.0 months, P = 0.384) or objective response rate (37.4% vs. 45.1%, P = 0.291) between the two groups. In patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and liver metastasis, the EOX arm had a significantly longer mOS (P = 0.021) and a trend of longer mPFS (P = 0.073) than the XELOX arm. The rate of grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) was 42.2% (90/213) in the XELOX arm and 72.5% (156/215) in the EOX arm (P = 0.001). The global health-related quality of life (QoL) score was significantly higher in the XELOX arm than in the EOX arm during chemotherapy. This non-inferiority trial demonstrated that the doublet regimen was as effective as the triplet regimen and had a better safety profile and QoL as a first-line treatment for AGC patients.

"Intercalated combination of chemotherapy and erlotinib for patients with advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer (FASTACT-2): a randomised, double-blind trial. The results of FASTACT, a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study, showed that intercalated chemotherapy and erlotinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. We undertook FASTACT-2, a phase 3 study in a similar patient population. In this phase 3 trial, patients with untreated stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by use of an interactive internet response system with minimisation algorithm (stratified by disease stage, tumour histology, smoking status, and chemotherapy regimen) to receive six cycles of gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, intravenously) plus platinum (carboplatin 5 × area under the curve or cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, intravenously) with intercalated erlotinib (150 mg/day on days 15-28, orally; chemotherapy plus erlotinib) or placebo orally (chemotherapy plus placebo) every 4 weeks. With the exception of an independent group responsible for monitoring data and safety monitoring board, everyone outside the interactive internet response system company was masked to treatment allocation. Patients continued to receive erlotinib or placebo until progression or unacceptable toxicity or death, and all patients in the placebo group were offered second-line erlotinib at the time of progression. The primary endpoint was PFS in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00883779. From April 29, 2009, to Sept 9, 2010, 451 patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus erlotinib (n=226) or chemotherapy plus placebo (n=225). PFS was significantly prolonged with chemotherapy plus erlotinib versus chemotherapy plus placebo (median PFS 7·6 months [95% CI 7·2-8·3], vs 6·0 months [5·6-7·1], hazard ratio [HR] 0·57 [0·47-0·69]; p<0·0001). Median overall survival for patients in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib and chemotherapy plus placebo groups was 18·3 months (16·3-20·8) and 15·2 months (12·7-17·5), respectively (HR 0·79 [0·64-0·99]; p=0·0420). Treatment benefit was noted only in patients with an activating EGFR gene mutation (median PFS 16·8 months [12·9-20·4] vs 6·9 months [5·3-7·6], HR 0·25 [0·16-0·39]; p<0·0001; median overall survival 31·4 months [22·2-undefined], vs 20·6 months [14·2-26·9], HR 0·48 [0·27-0·84]; p=0·0092). Serious adverse events were reported by 76 (34%) of 222 patients in the chemotherapy plus placebo group and 69 (31%) of 226 in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group. The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events were neutropenia (65 [29%] patients and 55 [25%], respectively), thrombocytopenia (32 [14%] and 31 [14%], respectively), and anaemia (26 [12%] and 21 [9%], respectively).

"Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for prostate volume reduction, lower urinary tract symptom relief and quality of life improvement in men with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer: a randomised non-inferiority trial of degarelix versus goserelin plus bicalutamide. The treatment of intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer with radical radiotherapy is usually in combination with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. The aim of the present trial was to investigate whether degarelix achieves comparable efficacy with that of goserelin plus bicalutamide as neoadjuvant therapy before radiotherapy. The study was a randomised, parallel-arm, active-controlled, open-label trial in 244 men with a UICC prostate cancer TNM category T2b-T4, N0, M0, Gleason score ≥7, or prostate-specific antigen ≥10 ng/ml and a total prostate volume >30 ml, who were scheduled to undergo radical radiotherapy and in whom neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was indicated. Eligible patients received treatment with either monthly degarelix (240/80 mg) or goserelin (3.6 mg) for 12 weeks, the latter patients also receiving bicalutamide (50 mg) for 17 days initially. The primary efficacy measure was the mean percentage reduction in total prostate volume from baseline at week 12 measured by transrectal ultrasound. The severity and relief of lower urinary tract symptoms were assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire. Quality of life was assessed by the eighth question of the International Prostate Symptom Score. About 50% of the patients had moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms at baseline. The total prostate volume decreased significantly from baseline to week 12 in both treatment groups, reaching -36.0 ± 14.5% in degarelix-treated patients and -35.3 ± 16.7% in goserelin-treated patients (adjusted difference: -0.3%; 95% confidence interval: -4.74; 4.14%). At the end of the therapy, more degarelix- than goserelin-treated patients reported International Prostate Symptom Score decreases of ≥3 points (37% versus 27%, P = 0.21). In addition, in patients with a baseline International Prostate Symptom Score of ≥13, the magnitude of the decrease was larger in degarelix- (n = 53) versus goserelin-treated patients (n = 17) (6.04 versus 3.41, P = 0.06). The efficacy of degarelix in terms of prostate shrinkage is non-inferior to that of goserelin plus bicalutamide. The added benefits of degarelix in terms of more pronounced lower urinary tract symptom relief in symptomatic patients could be the reflection of differences in the direct effects on extra-pituitary receptors in the lower urinary tract [Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT00833248].",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23257248/,23257248,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin compared to Degarelix monotherapy when used to treat Prostate cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin versus Degarelix monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin and Degarelix monotherapy for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin versus Degarelix monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin when compared with Degarelix monotherapy for Prostate cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin in comparison to Degarelix monotherapy for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin compared to Degarelix monotherapy for addressing Prostate cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin and Degarelix monotherapy in the treatment of Prostate cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin against Degarelix monotherapy for managing Prostate cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin compared to Degarelix monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin contrasted with Degarelix monotherapy in relation to Prostate cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin versus Degarelix monotherapy for treating Prostate cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin and Degarelix monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin as opposed to Degarelix monotherapy in managing Prostate cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin compared to Degarelix monotherapy in the context of Prostate cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Bicalutamide and Goserelin compares to Degarelix monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Prostate cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin in relation to Degarelix monotherapy for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Bicalutamide and Goserelin versus Degarelix monotherapy for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Bicalutamide and Goserelin's efficacy in comparison with Degarelix monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Bicalutamide and Goserelin against Degarelix monotherapy regarding Prostate cancer.,3,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00833248,"{""23257248"": ""M Mason|X Maldonado Pijoan|C Steidle|S Guerif|T Wiegel|E van der Meulen|P B F Bergqvist|V Khoo""}",2009-04,Yes,Yes,Rectal|Oral|Subcutaneous,Unknown
"Phase III trial comparing intensive induction chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy, infusional 5-FU and intermittent cisplatin) followed by maintenance gemcitabine with gemcitabine alone for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. Definitive results of the 2000-01 FFCD/SFRO study. The role of chemoradiation with systemic chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is uncertain. One hundred and nineteen patients with LAPC, World Health Organization performance status of zero to two were randomly assigned to either the induction CHRT group (60 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction; concomitant 5-fluorouracil infusion, 300 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-5 for 6 weeks; cisplatin, 20 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-5 during weeks 1 and 5) or the induction gemcitabine group (GEM: 1000 mg/m(2) weekly for 7 weeks). Maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) weekly, 3/4 weeks) was given in both arms until disease progression or toxicity. Overall survival was shorter in the CHRT than in GEM arm [median survival 8.6 (99% confidence interval 7.1-11.4) and 13 months (8.7-18.1), P = 0.03]. One-year survival was, respectively, 32% and 53%.

"Addition of sirolimus to standard cyclosporine plus mycophenolate mofetil-based graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis for patients after unrelated non-myeloablative haemopoietic stem cell transplantation: a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial. Acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after non-myeloablative human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding sirolimus to the standard cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil prophylaxis therapy for preventing acute GVHD in this setting. This multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial took place at nine HSCT centres based in the USA, Denmark, and Germany. Eligible patients were diagnosed with advanced haematological malignancies treatable by allogeneic HSCT, had a Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 60, were aged older than 50 years, or if they were aged 50 years or younger, were considered at high risk of regimen-related toxicity associated with a high-dose pre-transplantation conditioning regimen. Patients were randomly allocated by an adaptive randomisation scheme stratified by transplantation centre to receive either the standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen (cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil) or the triple-drug combination regimen (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus). Patients and physicians were not masked to treatment. All patients were prepared for HSCT with fludarabine (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day) 4, 3, and 2 days before receiving 2 or 3 Gy total body irradiation on the day of HSCT (day 0). In both study groups, 5·0 mg/kg of cyclosporine was administered orally twice daily starting 3 days before HSCT, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered from day 96 through to day 150. In the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, 15 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil was given orally three times daily from day 0 until day 30, then twice daily until day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. In the triple-drug group, mycophenolate mofetil doses were the same as in the standard group, but the drug was discontinued on day 40. Sirolimus was started 3 days before HSCT, taken orally at 2 mg once daily and adjusted to maintain trough concentrations between 3-12 ng/mL through to day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD at day 100 post-transplantation. Secondary endpoints were non-relapse mortality, overall survival, progression-free survival, cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD, and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Efficacy and safety analyses were per protocol, including all patients who received conditioning treatment and underwent transplantation. Toxic effects were measured according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The current study was closed prematurely by recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board on July 27, 2016, after 168 patients received the allocated intervention, based on the results of a prespecified interim analysis for futility. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01231412. Participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2010, and July 27, 2016. Of 180 patients enrolled in the study, 167 received the complete study intervention and were included in safety and efficacy analyses: 77 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group and 90 in the triple-drug group. At the time of analysis, median follow-up was 48 months (IQR 31-60). The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD at day 100 was lower in the triple-drug group compared with the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (26% [95% CI 17-35] in the triple-drug group vs 52% [41-63] in the standard group; HR 0·45 [95% CI 0·28-0·73]; p=0·0013). After 1 and 4 years, non-relapse mortality increased to 4% (95% CI 0-9) and 16% (8-24) in the triple-drug group and 16% (8-24) and 32% (21-43) in the standard group (HR 0·48 [0·26-0·90]; p=0·021). Overall survival at 1 year was 86% (95% CI 78-93) in the triple-drug group and 70% in the standard group (60-80) and at 4 years it was 64% in the triple-drug group (54-75) and 46% in the standard group (34-57%; HR 0·62 [0·40-0·97]; p=0·035). Progression-free survival at 1 year was 77% (95% CI 68-85) in the triple-drug group and 64% (53-74) in the standard drug group, and at 4 years it was 59% in the triple-drug group (49-70) and 41% in the standard group (30-53%; HR 0·64 [0·42-0·99]; p=0·045). We observed no difference in the cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD (2% [0-5] in the triple-drug group vs 8% [2-14] in the standard group; HR 0·55 [0·16-1·96]; p=0·36) and chronic GVHD (49% [39-59] in triple-drug group vs 50% [39-61] in the standard group; HR 0·94 [0·62-1·40]; p=0·74). In both groups the most common CTCAE grade 4 or higher toxic effects were pulmonary. Adding sirolimus to cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in a significantly lower proportion of patients developing acute GVHD compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil alone. Based on these results, the combination of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus has become the new standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients treated with non-myeloablative conditioning and HLA-matched unrelated HSCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

"Fludarabine and 2-Gy TBI is superior to 2 Gy TBI as conditioning for HLA-matched related hematopoietic cell transplantation: a phase III randomized trial. The risks and benefits of adding fludarabine to a 2-Gy total body irradiation (TBI) nonmyeloablative regimen are unknown. For this reason, we conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing 2-Gy TBI alone, or in combination with 90 mg/m(2) fludarabine (FLU/TBI), before transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-matched related donors. Eighty-five patients with hematological malignancies were randomized to be conditioned with TBI alone (n = 44) or FLU/TBI (n = 41). All patients had initial engraftment. Two graft rejections were observed, both in the TBI group. Infection rates, nonrelapse mortality, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were similar between groups. Three-year overall survival was lower in the TBI group (54% versus 65%; hazard ratio [HR], .57; P = .09), with higher incidences of relapse/progression (55% versus 40%; HR, .55; P = .06), relapse-related mortality (37% versus 28%; HR, .53; P = .09), and a lower progression-free survival (36% versus 53%; HR, .56; P = .05). Median donor T cell chimerism levels were significantly lower in the TBI group at days 28 (61% versus 90%; P < .0001) and 84 (68% versus 92%; P < .0001), as was NK cell chimerism on day 28 (75% versus 96%; P = .0005). In conclusion, this randomized trial demonstrates the importance of fludarabine in augmenting the graft-versus-tumor effect by ensuring prompt and durable high-level donor engraftment early after transplantation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23769990/,23769990,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI compared to Low-dose TBI when used to treat Allogeneic HSCT.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI versus Low-dose TBI in treating Allogeneic HSCT.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI and Low-dose TBI for managing Allogeneic HSCT?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI versus Low-dose TBI in treating Allogeneic HSCT.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI when compared with Low-dose TBI for Allogeneic HSCT?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI in comparison to Low-dose TBI for the treatment of Allogeneic HSCT.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI compared to Low-dose TBI for addressing Allogeneic HSCT.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI and Low-dose TBI in the treatment of Allogeneic HSCT?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI against Low-dose TBI for managing Allogeneic HSCT.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI compared to Low-dose TBI in treating Allogeneic HSCT.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI contrasted with Low-dose TBI in relation to Allogeneic HSCT?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI versus Low-dose TBI for treating Allogeneic HSCT.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI and Low-dose TBI in treating Allogeneic HSCT?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI as opposed to Low-dose TBI in managing Allogeneic HSCT.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI compared to Low-dose TBI in the context of Allogeneic HSCT.,What option most accurately summarizes how Fludarabine and TBI compares to Low-dose TBI in terms of effectiveness for Allogeneic HSCT?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI in relation to Low-dose TBI for the treatment of Allogeneic HSCT.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Fludarabine and TBI versus Low-dose TBI for managing Allogeneic HSCT?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Fludarabine and TBI's efficacy in comparison with Low-dose TBI in treating Allogeneic HSCT.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Fludarabine and TBI against Low-dose TBI regarding Allogeneic HSCT.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00075478,"{""23769990"": ""Brian Kornblit|David G Maloney|Rainer Storb|Jan Storek|Parameswaran Hari|Vladan Vucinic|Richard T Maziarz|Thomas R Chauncey|Michael A Pulsipher|Benedetto Bruno|Finn B Petersen|Wolfgang A Bethge|Kai Hübel|Michelle E Bouvier|Takahiro Fukuda|Barry E Storer|Brenda M Sandmaier""}",2003-10,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Unknown
"Comparison of fixed-dose weight-adjusted unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin for acute treatment of venous thromboembolism. When unfractionated heparin is used to treat acute venous thromboembolism, it is usually administered by intravenous infusion with coagulation monitoring, which requires hospitalization. However, subcutaneous administration of fixed-dose, weight-adjusted, unfractionated heparin may be suitable for inpatient and outpatient treatment of venous thromboembolism. To determine if fixed-dose, weight-adjusted, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is as effective and safe as low-molecular-weight heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolism. Randomized, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, noninferiority trial of 708 patients aged 18 years or older with acute venous thromboembolism from 6 university-affiliated clinical centers in Canada and New Zealand conducted from September 1998 through February 2004. Of the randomized patients, 11 were subsequently excluded from the analysis of efficacy and 8 from the analysis of safety. Unfractionated heparin was administered subcutaneously as an initial dose of 333 U/kg, followed by a fixed dose of 250 U/kg every 12 hours (n = 345). Low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin or enoxaparin) was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 100 IU/kg every 12 hours (n = 352). Both treatments could be administered out of hospital and both were overlapped with 3 months of warfarin therapy. Recurrent venous thromboembolism within 3 months and major bleeding within 10 days of randomization. Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 13 patients in the unfractionated heparin group (3.8%) compared with 12 patients in the low-molecular-weight heparin group (3.4%; absolute difference, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, -2.6% to 3.3%). Major bleeding during the first 10 days of treatment occurred in 4 patients in the unfractionated heparin group (1.1%) compared with 5 patients in the low-molecular-weight heparin group (1.4%; absolute difference, -0.3%; 95% confidence interval, -2.3% to 1.7%). Treatment was administered entirely out of hospital in 72% of the unfractionated heparin group and 68% of the low-molecular-weight heparin group. Fixed-dose subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is as effective and safe as low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with acute venous thromboembolism and is suitable for outpatient treatment. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00182403.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16926353/,16926353,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy compared to Dalteparin monotherapy when used to treat Venous thromboembolism.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy versus Dalteparin monotherapy in treating Venous thromboembolism.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy and Dalteparin monotherapy for managing Venous thromboembolism?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy versus Dalteparin monotherapy in treating Venous thromboembolism.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy when compared with Dalteparin monotherapy for Venous thromboembolism?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy in comparison to Dalteparin monotherapy for the treatment of Venous thromboembolism.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy compared to Dalteparin monotherapy for addressing Venous thromboembolism.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy and Dalteparin monotherapy in the treatment of Venous thromboembolism?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy against Dalteparin monotherapy for managing Venous thromboembolism.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy compared to Dalteparin monotherapy in treating Venous thromboembolism.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy contrasted with Dalteparin monotherapy in relation to Venous thromboembolism?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy versus Dalteparin monotherapy for treating Venous thromboembolism.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy and Dalteparin monotherapy in treating Venous thromboembolism?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy as opposed to Dalteparin monotherapy in managing Venous thromboembolism.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy compared to Dalteparin monotherapy in the context of Venous thromboembolism.,What option most accurately summarizes how Enoxaparin monotherapy compares to Dalteparin monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Venous thromboembolism?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy in relation to Dalteparin monotherapy for the treatment of Venous thromboembolism.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Enoxaparin monotherapy versus Dalteparin monotherapy for managing Venous thromboembolism?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Enoxaparin monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Dalteparin monotherapy in treating Venous thromboembolism.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Enoxaparin monotherapy against Dalteparin monotherapy regarding Venous thromboembolism.,3,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00182403,"{""16926353"": ""Clive Kearon|Jeffrey S Ginsberg|Jim A Julian|James Douketis|Susan Solymoss|Paul Ockelford|Sharon Jackson|Alexander G Turpie|Betsy MacKinnon|Jack Hirsh|Michael Gent|Fixed-Dose Heparin (FIDO) Investigators""}",1998-09,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Subcutaneous,Unknown
"Randomized Phase III Trial Evaluating Subcutaneous Rituximab for the First-Line Treatment of Low-Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma: Results of a LYSA Study. Rituximab improves progression-free survival (PFS) and time to next treatment (TTNT) when compared with the watch and wait strategy for patients with low-tumor burden follicular lymphoma (FL). Prolonged rituximab maintenance did not prolong TTNT, whereas it raises concerns about resources use and patient adhesion. Our aim was then to investigate the use of short rituximab maintenance using the subcutaneous (SC) route in patients with low-tumor burden FL. Patients with histologically confirmed CD20<sup>+</sup> low-tumor burden FL were randomly assigned to receive either rituximab, 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once daily on D1, D8, D15, and D22, intravenous route (IV, control arm), or rituximab, 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, on day 1 (D1), IV followed by rituximab 1,400 mg total dose, SC once daily on D8, D15, and D22, with maintenance at months 3 (M3), M5, M7, and M9 (experimental arm). The primary end point was PFS. Secondary end points included safety, overall response rates, TTNT, and overall survival (OS). Two hundred two patients with low-tumor burden FL were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 100) or control arm (n = 102). The primary end point was met: the 4-year PFS was 58.1% (95% CI, 47.5 to 67.4) and 41.2% (95% CI, 30.6 to 51.6) in experimental and control arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.585 [0.393 to 0.871]; <i>P</i> = .0076). Complete response (CR) rates were 59.0% (95% CI, 48.7 to 68.7) in the experimental arm and 36.3% (95% CI, 27.0 to 46.4) in the control arm (<i>P</i> = .001). TTNT and OS were not significantly different. CR was associated with longer PFS and TTNT. High rituximab exposure during the first three months was independently associated with higher CR, PFS, and TTNT. SC rituximab improves PFS for patients with low-tumor burden FL when used in induction followed by short maintenance.

"A phase 3 trial of azacitidine versus a semi-intensive fludarabine and cytarabine schedule in older patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Options to treat elderly patients (≥65 years old) newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) include intensive and attenuated chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents with or without venetoclax, and supportive care. This multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLUGA) regimen in comparison with azacitidine (AZA). Patients (n = 283) were randomized 1:1 to FLUGA (n = 141) or AZA (n = 142). Response was evaluated after cycles 1, 3, 6, and 9. Measurable residual disease (MRD) was assessed after cycle 9. When MRD was ≥0.01%, patients continued with the treatment until relapse or progressive disease. Patients with MRD < 0.01% suspended treatment to enter the follow-up phase. The complete remission (CR) rate after 3 cycles was significantly better in the FLUGA arm (18% vs 9%; P = .04), but the CR/CR with incomplete recovery rate at 9 months was similar (33% vs 29%; P = .41). There were no significant differences between arms in early mortality at 30 or 60 days. Hematologic toxicities were more frequent with FLUGA, especially during induction. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate and the median OS were superior with AZA versus FLUGA: 47% versus 27% and 9.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-14 months) versus 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.7-5.5 months; P = .005), respectively. The median event-free survival was 4.9 months (95% CI, 2.8-7 months) with AZA and 3 months (95% CI, 2.5-3.5 months) with FLUGA (P = .001). FLUGA achieved more remissions after 3 cycles, but the 1-year OS rate was superior with AZA. However, long-term outcomes were disappointing in both arms (3-year OS rate, 10% vs 5%).

"Four versus six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy in combination with six applications of rituximab in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma with favourable prognosis (FLYER): a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial. Six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) are the standard treatment for aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In the FLYER trial, we assessed whether four cycles of CHOP plus six applications of rituximab are non-inferior to six cycles of R-CHOP in a population of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with favourable prognosis. This two-arm, open-label, international, multicentre, prospective, randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial was done at 138 clinical sites in Denmark, Israel, Italy, Norway, and Germany. We enrolled patients aged 18-60 years, with stage I-II disease, normal serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, ECOG performance status 0-1, and without bulky disease (maximal tumour diameter <7·5 cm). Randomisation was computer-based and done centrally in a 1:1 ratio using the Pocock minimisation algorithm after stratification for centres, stage (I vs II), and extralymphatic sites (no vs yes). Patients were assigned to receive either six cycles of R-CHOP or four cycles of R-CHOP plus two doses of rituximab. CHOP comprised cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), doxorubicin (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), and vincristine (1·4 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, with a maximum total dose of 2 mg), all administered intravenously on day 1, plus oral prednisone or prednisolone at the discretion of the investigator (100 mg) administered on days 1-5. Rituximab was given at a dose of 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. No radiotherapy was planned except for testicular lymphoma treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival after 3 years. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment. A non-inferiority margin of -5·5% was chosen. The trial, which is completed, was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00278421. Between Dec 2, 2005, and Oct 7, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled, of whom 295 patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of R-CHOP and 297 were assigned to receive four cycles of R-CHOP plus two doses of rituximab. Four patients in the four-cycles group withdrew informed consent before the start of treatment, so 588 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. After a median follow-up of 66 months (IQR 42-100), 3-year progression-free survival of patients who had four cycles of R-CHOP plus two doses of rituximab was 96% (95% CI 94-99), which was 3% better (lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference was 0%) than six cycles of R-CHOP, demonstrating the non-inferiority of the four-cycles regimen. 294 haematological and 1036 non-haematological adverse events were documented in the four-cycles group compared with 426 haematological and 1280 non-haematological adverse events in the six-cycles group. Two patients, both in the six-cycles group, died during study therapy. In young patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and favourable prognosis, four cycles of R-CHOP is non-inferior to six cycles of R-CHOP, with relevant reduction of toxic effects. Thus, chemotherapy can be reduced without compromising outcomes in this population.

"Etoposide plus cisplatin with or without the combination of 4'-epidoxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in treatment of extensive small-cell lung cancer: a French Federation of Cancer Institutes multicenter phase III randomized study. The combination of etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) is considered to be standard therapy for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). To determine whether drug intensification improves survival of patients with extensive SCLC, we compared this treatment with a four-drug regimen containing EP plus cyclophosphamide and 4'-epidoxorubicin (PCDE). In a phase III clinical trial organized by the French Federation of Cancer Institutes, patients were randomly assigned to receive either EP (n = 109; etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) on days 1-3 plus cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2) on day 2) or PCDE (n = 117; etoposide and cisplatin given as in EP plus cyclophosphamide at 400 mg/m(2) on days 1-3 and 4'-epidoxorubicin at 40 mg/m(2) on day 1) every 4 weeks. Both groups received a total of six cycles. Survival differences were analyzed by Wilcoxon and log-rank tests. Associations of treatment group and putative prognostic variables with survival were tested in the Cox proportional hazards model. Quality of life was assessed from the responses to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaire (C30, health status and lung cancer module 13). All statistical tests were two-sided. Patients in the PCDE arm had a statistically significant higher frequency of combined complete plus partial responses compared with those in the EP arm (21% plus 55% versus 13% plus 48%, respectively; P =.02 for difference in combined objective responses). Patients in the PCDE arm survived longer than those in the EP arm (1-year survival rate: 40% and 29%, respectively; median survival: 10.5 and 9.3 months, respectively; log-rank P =.0067). In the Cox model, the relative risk of death for patients in the PCDE arm compared with those in the EP arm was 0.70 (95% confidence interval = 0.51 to 0.95); the disease also progressed more slowly in patients in the PCDE arm. Hematologic toxicity was higher in the PCDE arm (22% with documented infections compared with 8% in the EP arm; P =.0038), and the toxicity-related death rate was 9% in the PCDE arm versus 5.5% in the EP arm (P =.22). The global health status showed similar improvement in both arms during treatment. Compared with the EP regimen, the PCDE regimen yielded higher response rates and better survival rates in patients with extensive SCLC without affecting the quality of life of the patients during chemotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11181777/,11181777,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of PCDE compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) when used to treat Small cell lung cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of PCDE versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of PCDE and Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of PCDE versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of PCDE when compared with Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for Small cell lung cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of PCDE in comparison to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of PCDE compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for addressing Small cell lung cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of PCDE and Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in the treatment of Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of PCDE against Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for managing Small cell lung cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of PCDE compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of PCDE contrasted with Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in relation to Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of PCDE versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of PCDE and Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of PCDE as opposed to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in managing Small cell lung cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of PCDE compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in the context of Small cell lung cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how PCDE compares to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in terms of effectiveness for Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of PCDE in relation to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of PCDE versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of PCDE's efficacy in comparison with Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of PCDE against Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) regarding Small cell lung cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003606,"{""11181777"": ""J L Pujol|J P Daurès|A Rivière|E Quoix|V Westeel|X Quantin|J L Breton|E Lemarié|M Poudenx|B Milleron|D Moro|D Debieuvre|T Le Chevalier""}",1996-03,No,No,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy

"Effect of S-1 Plus Oxaliplatin Compared With Fluorouracil, Leucovorin Plus Oxaliplatin as Perioperative Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced, Resectable Gastric Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Perioperative chemotherapy is a potential treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer. However, the optimal chemotherapy regimen remains unknown. To investigate the safety and efficacy of S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) vs fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as a perioperative chemotherapy regimen for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, patients from 12 Chinese hospitals were enrolled between June 2011 and August 2016, with a last follow-up date of September 2019. The primary tumor was evaluated as either invading the serosa or the adjacent structures with or without metastatic lymph nodes, and with no evidence of distant metastases. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to June 2020. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 6 perioperative (2-4 preoperative and 2-4 postoperative) 3-week cycles of 130 mg/m2 oxaliplatin on day 1 and 80 to 120 mg/d S-1 orally daily for 2 weeks (SOX) or 130 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 400 mg/m2 fluorouracil, 400 mg/m2 leucovorin, and 2400 mg/m2 fluorouracil as 46-hour infusion on day 1 (FOLFOX). The primary end point was 3-year overall survival (OS). An absolute noninferiority margin of -8% was chosen. A total of 583 patients were enrolled; 293 were randomized to the SOX group and 290 were randomized to the FOLFOX group. Twelve patients (2.1%) refused preoperative chemotherapy (5 patients in the SOX group and 7 patients in the FOLFOX group), leaving a total of 288 patients in the SOX group (median [range] age, 61 [24 to 78] years; 197 men [68.4%]) and 283 patients in the FOLFOX group (median [range] age, 62 [24 to 80] years; 209 men [73.9%]) who received preoperative chemotherapy. The 3-year OS rate was 75.2% (95% CI, 70.3% to 80.5%) in the SOX group and 67.8% (95% CI, 62.5% to 73.5%) in the FOLFOX group. The absolute difference of 3-year OS rate between the 2 groups was 7.4% (95% CI, -0.1% to 14.9%), which was greater than the prespecified noninferiority margin (-8%) and showed the noninferiority of perioperative chemotherapy with SOX compared with FOLFOX. In this randomized clinical trial, SOX was noninferior to FOLFOX as perioperative chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer and could be recommended as an alternative treatment for these patients in Asia.

"Arterial Chemotherapy of Oxaliplatin Plus Fluorouracil Versus Sorafenib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Biomolecular Exploratory, Randomized, Phase III Trial (FOHAIC-1). Interventional hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (HAIC-FO) displayed an encouraging safety profile and antitumor activity in a previous phase II trial and a propensity-score-matching study involving patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with advanced HCC, previously untreated with systemic therapy, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive HAIC-FO or sorafenib. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population. An exploratory model for predicting the efficacy of HAIC-FO on the basis of genomic sequencing was developed. Between May 2017 and May 2020, 262 patients were randomly assigned. The median tumor size was 11.2 cm (interquartile range, 8.5-13.7 cm). Macrovascular invasion was present in 65.6%, and the percentage of patients with > 50% tumor volume involvement of the liver and/or Vp-4 portal vein tumor thrombosis was 49.2%. At data cutoff (October 31, 2020), median OS was 13.9 months for HAIC-FO and 8.2 for sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.408; 95% CI, 0.301 to 0.552; <i>P</i> < .001). Tumor downstaging occurred in 16 (12.3% of 130) patients receiving HAIC-FO, including 15 receiving curative surgery or ablation, and finally achieving a median OS of 20.8 months, with a 1-year OS rate of 93.8%. In high-risk subpopulations, OS was significantly longer with HAIC-FO than with sorafenib (10.8 months <i>v</i> 5.7 months; HR 0.343; 95% CI, 0.219 to 0.538; <i>P</i> < .001).

"Response-Adapted Postinduction Strategy in Patients With Advanced-Stage Follicular Lymphoma: The FOLL12 Study. We compared 2 years of rituximab maintenance (RM) with a response-adapted postinduction approach in patients with follicular lymphoma who responded to induction immunochemotherapy. We randomly assigned treatment-naïve, advanced-stage, high-tumor burden follicular lymphoma patients to receive standard RM or a response-adapted postinduction approach on the basis of metabolic response and molecular assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). The experimental arm used three types of postinduction therapies: for complete metabolic response (CMR) and MRD-negative patients, observation; for CMR and MRD-positive (end of induction or follow-up) patients, four doses of rituximab (one per week, maximum three courses) until MRD-negative; and for non-CMR patients, one dose of ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by standard RM. The study was designed as noninferiority trial with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary end point. Overall, 807 patients were randomly assigned. After a median follow-up of 53 months (range, 1-92 months), patients in the standard arm had a significantly better PFS than those in the experimental arm (3-year PFS 86% <i>v</i> 72%; <i>P</i> < .001). The better PFS of the standard versus experimental arm was confirmed in all the study subgroups except non-CMR patients (n = 65; <i>P</i> = .274). The 3-year overall survival was 98% (95% CI, 96 to 99) and 97% (95% CI, 95 to 99) in the reference and experimental arms, respectively (<i>P</i> = .238). A metabolic and molecular response-adapted therapy as assessed in the FOLL12 study was associated with significantly inferior PFS compared with 2-year RM.

"Carfilzomib with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone plus autologous transplantation or carfilzomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone, followed by maintenance with carfilzomib plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (FORTE): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial. Bortezomib-based induction followed by high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and autologous stem-cell transplantation (MEL200-ASCT) and maintenance treatment with lenalidomide alone is the current standard of care for young and fit patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different carfilzomib-based induction and consolidation approaches with or without transplantation and of maintenance treatment with carfilzomib plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. UNITO-MM-01/FORTE was a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial done in 42 Italian academic and community practice centres. We enrolled transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 65 years or younger with a Karnofsky Performance Status of 60% or higher. Patients were stratified according to International Staging System stage (I vs II/III) and age (<60 years vs 60-65 years) and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to KRd plus ASCT (four 28-day induction cycles with carfilzomib plus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone [KRd], melphalan at 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and autologous stem-cell transplantation [MEL200-ASCT], followed by four 28-day KRd consolidation cycles), KRd12 (12 28-day KRd cycles), or KCd plus ASCT (four 28-day induction cycles with carfilzomib plus cyclophosphamide plus dexamethasone [KCd], MEL200-ASCT, and four 28-day KCd consolidation cycles). Carfilzomib 36 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was administered intravenously on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16; lenalidomide 25 mg administered orally on days 1-21; cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered orally on days 1, 8, and 15; and dexamethasone 20 mg administered orally or intravenously on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Thereafter, patients were stratified according to induction-consolidation treatment and randomly assigned (1:1) to maintenance treatment with carfilzomib plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide alone. Carfilzomib 36 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was administered intravenously on days 1-2 and 15-16 every 28 days for up to 2 years; lenalidomide 10 mg was administered orally on days 1-21 every 28 days until progression or intolerance in both groups. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with at least a very good partial response after induction with KRd versus KCd and progression-free survival with carfilzomib plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide alone as maintenance treatment, both assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02203643. Study recruitment is complete, and all patients are in the follow-up or maintenance phases. Between Feb 23, 2015, and April 5, 2017, 474 patients were randomly assigned to one of the induction-intensification-consolidation groups (158 to KRd plus ASCT, 157 to KRd12, and 159 to KCd plus ASCT). The median duration of follow-up was 50·9 months (IQR 45·7-55·3) from the first randomisation. 222 (70%) of 315 patients in the KRd group and 84 (53%) of 159 patients in the KCd group had at least a very good partial response after induction (OR 2·14, 95% CI 1·44-3·19, p=0·0002). 356 patients were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with carfilzomib plus lenalidomide (n=178) or lenalidomide alone (n=178). The median duration of follow-up was 37·3 months (IQR 32·9-41·9) from the second randomisation. 3-year progression-free survival was 75% (95% CI 68-82) with carfilzomib plus lenalidomide versus 65% (58-72) with lenalidomide alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·64 [95% CI 0·44-0·94], p=0·023). During induction and consolidation, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (21 [13%] of 158 patients in the KRd plus ASCT group vs 15 [10%] of 156 in the KRd12 group vs 18 [11%] of 159 in the KCd plus ASCT group); dermatological toxicity (nine [6%] vs 12 [8%] vs one [1%]); and hepatic toxicity (13 [8%] vs 12 [8%] vs none). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 18 (11%) of 158 patients in the KRd-ASCT group, 29 (19%) of 156 in the KRd12 group, and 17 (11%) of 159 in the KCd plus ASCT group; the most common serious adverse event was pneumonia, in seven (4%) of 158, four (3%) of 156, and five (3%) of 159 patients. Treatment-emergent deaths were reported in two (1%) of 158 patients in the KRd plus ASCT group, two (1%) of 156 in the KRd12 group, and three (2%) of 159 in the KCd plus ASCT group. During maintenance, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (35 [20%] of 173 patients on carfilzomib plus lenalidomide vs 41 [23%] of 177 patients on lenalidomide alone); infections (eight [5%] vs 13 [7%]); and vascular events (12 [7%] vs one [1%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 24 (14%) of 173 patients on carfilzomib plus lenalidomide versus 15 (8%) of 177 on lenalidomide alone; the most common serious adverse event was pneumonia, in six (3%) of 173 versus five (3%) of 177 patients. One patient died of a treatment-emergent adverse event in the carfilzomib plus lenalidomide group. Our data show that KRd plus ASCT showed superiority in terms of improved responses compared with the other two treatment approaches and support the prospective randomised evaluation of KRd plus ASCT versus standards of care (eg, daratumumab plus bortezomib plus thalidomide plus dexamethasone plus ASCT) in transplant-eligible patients with multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib plus lenalidomide as maintenance therapy also improved progression-free survival compared with the standard-of-care lenalidomide alone. Amgen, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb.

"Fuzuloparib Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Platinum-Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma (FZOCUS-2): A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Trial. This phase III trial aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of fuzuloparib (formerly fluzoparib) versus placebo as a maintenance treatment after response to second- or later-line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer previously treated with at least two platinum-based regimens were assigned (2:1) to receive fuzuloparib (150 mg, twice daily) or matching placebo for 28-day cycles. The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) in the overall population and PFS by BIRC in the subpopulation with germline <i>BRCA 1/2</i> mutation. Between April 30, 2019, and January 10, 2020, 252 patients were randomly assigned to the fuzuloparib (n = 167) or placebo (n = 85). As of July 1, 2020, the median PFS per BIRC assessment in the overall population was significantly improved with fuzuloparib treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.36; one-sided <i>P</i> < .0001) compared with that with placebo. The HR derived from a prespecified subgroup analysis showed a consistent trend of benefit in patients with germline <i>BRCA 1/2</i> mutations (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.28) or in those without mutations (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.74). The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the fuzuloparib group were anemia (25.1%), decreased platelet count (16.8%), and decreased neutrophil count (12.6%). Only one patient (0.6%) discontinued fuzuloparib because of treatment-related toxicity (concurrent decreased white blood cell count and neutrophil count). Fuzuloparib as maintenance therapy achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS for patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer versus placebo, regardless of germline <i>BRCA 1/2</i> mutation, and showed a manageable safety profile.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35404684/,35404684,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy compared to Placebo when used to treat Ovarian cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Ovarian cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy and Placebo for managing Ovarian cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Ovarian cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy when compared with Placebo for Ovarian cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy in comparison to Placebo for the treatment of Ovarian cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy compared to Placebo for addressing Ovarian cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy and Placebo in the treatment of Ovarian cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy against Placebo for managing Ovarian cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy compared to Placebo in treating Ovarian cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy contrasted with Placebo in relation to Ovarian cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy versus Placebo for treating Ovarian cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy and Placebo in treating Ovarian cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy as opposed to Placebo in managing Ovarian cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy compared to Placebo in the context of Ovarian cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Fuzuloparib monotherapy compares to Placebo in terms of effectiveness for Ovarian cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy in relation to Placebo for the treatment of Ovarian cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Fuzuloparib monotherapy versus Placebo for managing Ovarian cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Fuzuloparib monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Placebo in treating Ovarian cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Fuzuloparib monotherapy against Placebo regarding Ovarian cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT03863860,"{""35404684"": ""Ning Li|Youzhong Zhang|Jing Wang|Jianqing Zhu|Li Wang|Xiaohua Wu|Desheng Yao|Qiang Wu|Jihong Liu|Junying Tang|Rutie Yin|Ge Lou|Ruifang An|Guonan Zhang|Xiaoping Xia|Qingshui Li|Yaping Zhu|Hong Zheng|Xinfeng Yang|Yuanjing Hu|Xin Zhang|Min Hao|Yi Huang|Zhongqiu Lin|Dong Wang|Xiaoqing Guo|Shuzhong Yao|Xiaoyun Wan|Huaijun Zhou|Liangqing Yao|Xielan Yang|Heng Cui|Yuanguang Meng|Songling Zhang|Jing Qu|Ben Zhang|Jianjun Zou|Lingying Wu""}",2019-04-30,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Chemotherapy

"First-Line Venetoclax Combinations in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Randomized trials of venetoclax plus anti-CD20 antibodies as first-line treatment in fit patients (i.e., those with a low burden of coexisting conditions) with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been lacking. In a phase 3, open-label trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, fit patients with CLL who did not have <i>TP53</i> aberrations to receive six cycles of chemoimmunotherapy (fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab or bendamustine-rituximab) or 12 cycles of venetoclax-rituximab, venetoclax-obinutuzumab, or venetoclax-obinutuzumab-ibrutinib. Ibrutinib was discontinued after two consecutive measurements of undetectable minimal residual disease or could be extended. The primary end points were undetectable minimal residual disease (sensitivity, <10<sup>-4</sup> [i.e., <1 CLL cell in 10,000 leukocytes]) as assessed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood at month 15 and progression-free survival. A total of 926 patients were assigned to one of the four treatment regimens (229 to chemoimmunotherapy, 237 to venetoclax-rituximab, 229 to venetoclax-obinutuzumab, and 231 to venetoclax-obinutuzumab-ibrutinib). At month 15, the percentage of patients with undetectable minimal residual disease was significantly higher in the venetoclax-obinutuzumab group (86.5%; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 80.6 to 91.1) and the venetoclax-obinutuzumab-ibrutinib group (92.2%; 97.5% CI, 87.3 to 95.7) than in the chemoimmunotherapy group (52.0%; 97.5% CI, 44.4 to 59.5; P<0.001 for both comparisons), but it was not significantly higher in the venetoclax-rituximab group (57.0%; 97.5% CI, 49.5 to 64.2; P = 0.32).

"Gefitinib Plus Chemotherapy vs Gefitinib Alone in Untreated EGFR-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Patients With Brain Metastases: The GAP BRAIN Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase 3 Study. Use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is the standard therapy for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases. Several studies have shown that adding chemotherapy to EGFR-TKIs could improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC; however, the efficacy of these agents in patients with brain metastases remains unclear. To investigate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib plus chemotherapy (pemetrexed with platinum) compared with gefitinib alone in patients with untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastases. This open-label prospective, multicenter, phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted in 6 centers in China from January 13, 2016, to August 27, 2021. The median follow-up time was 21.1 months (IQR, 13.5-31.8 months). Patients with untreated confirmed brain metastases and EGFR-sensitive mutated NSCLC were enrolled. The eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gefitinib plus chemotherapy or gefitinib alone. The primary end point was intracranial PFS; secondary end points included PFS, overall survival (OS), intracranial objective response rate, overall objective response rate, and safety. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. A total of 161 patients (87 [54.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 55 [9.8] years; range, 26-80 years) were enrolled and randomized to receive gefitinib (n = 81) or gefitinib plus chemotherapy (n = 80). The median intracranial PFS was 15.6 months (95% CI, 14.3-16.9 months) in the gefitinib plus chemotherapy group vs 9.1 months (95% CI, 8.0-10.2 months) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.53; P < .001). Similarly, the median PFS was significantly longer with gefitinib plus chemotherapy than gefitinib alone (16.3; 95% CI, 14.4-18.2 months vs 9.5; 95% CI, 8.3-10.8 months; P < .001). Gefitinib plus chemotherapy had a better intracranial objective response rate (85.0%; 95% CI, 77.0%-93.0% vs 63.0%; 95% CI, 52.2%-73.7%; P = .002) and overall objective response rate (80.0%; 95% CI, 71.0%-89.0% vs 64.2%; 95% CI, 53.5%-74.9%; P = .03) than gefitinib alone. At data cutoff, the median OS was also significantly longer in the gefitinib plus chemotherapy group vs the gefitinib group (35.0 vs 28.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.99; P = .04). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were more common with gefitinib plus chemotherapy, most of which were manageable. In this randomized clinical trial, gefitinib plus chemotherapy significantly improved intracranial PFS, PFS, and OS compared with gefitinib alone in patients with untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastases and could be an optional first-line treatment for these patients.

"Randomized Phase II Trial Comparing Obinutuzumab (GA101) With Rituximab in Patients With Relapsed CD20+ Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: Final Analysis of the GAUSS Study. Obinutuzumab (GA101), a novel glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, demonstrated responses in single-arm studies of patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is the first prospective, randomized study comparing safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab with rituximab in relapsed indolent lymphoma. The primary end point of this study was the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with follicular lymphoma after induction and safety in patients with indolent lymphoma. A total of 175 patients with relapsed CD20(+) indolent lymphoma requiring therapy and with previous response to a rituximab-containing regimen were randomly assigned (1:1) to four once-per-week infusions of either obinutuzumab (1,000 mg) or rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). Patients without evidence of disease progression after induction therapy received obinutuzumab or rituximab maintenance therapy every 2 months for up to 2 years. Among patients with follicular lymphoma (n = 149), ORR seemed higher for obinutuzumab than rituximab (44.6% v 33.3%; P = .08). This observation was also demonstrated by a blinded independent review panel that measured a higher ORR for obinutuzumab (44.6% v 26.7%; P = .01). However, this difference did not translate into an improvement in progression-free survival. No new safety signals were observed for obinutuzumab, and the incidence of adverse events was balanced between arms, with the exception of infusion-related reactions and cough, which were higher in the obinutuzumab arm. Obinutuzumab demonstrated a higher ORR without appreciable differences in safety compared with rituximab.

"Thalidomide plus dexamethasone as a maintenance therapy after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation improves progression-free survival in multiple myeloma. Despite the good response of stem cell transplant (SCT) in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), most patients relapse or do not achieve complete remission, suggesting that additional treatment is needed. We assessed the impact of thalidomide in maintenance after SCT in untreated patients with MM. A hundred and eight patients (<70 years old) were randomized to receive maintenance with dexamethasone (arm A; n = 52) or dexamethasone with thalidomide (arm B; n = 56; 200 mg daily) for 12 months or until disease progression. After a median follow-up of 27 months, an intention to treat analysis showed a 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 30% in arm A (95% CI 22-38) and 64% in arm B (95% CI 57-71; P = 0.002), with median PFS of 19 months and 36 months, respectively. In patients who did not achieve at least a very good partial response, the PFS at 2 years was significantly higher when in use of thalidomide (19 vs. 59%; P = 0.002). Overall survival at 2 years was not significantly improved (70 vs. 85% in arm A and arm B, respectively; P = 0.27).

"Phase 3 trial of three thalidomide-containing regimens in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma not transplant-eligible. The introduction of agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib has changed the management of patients with multiple myeloma who are not eligible for autologous transplantation, many of whom are elderly. We sought to compare three thalidomide-based oral regimens among such patients in Latin America. We randomized patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with measurable disease to one of the following regimens: melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide (MPT); cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (CTD); and thalidomide and dexamethasone (TD). The TD arm was closed prematurely and was analyzed only descriptively. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR), whereas progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were secondary endpoints. The accrual rate was slower than expected, and the study was terminated after 82 patients had been randomized. The ORRs were 67.9 % with MPT, 89.7 % with CTD, and 68.7 % with TD (p = 0.056 for the comparison between MPT and CTD). The median PFS was 24.1 months for MPT, 25.9 months for CTD, and 21.5 months for TD. There were no statistically significant differences in PFS or OS between MPT and CTD. In an unplanned logistic regression analysis, ORR was significantly associated with treatment with CTD (p = 0.046) and with performance status of 0 or 1 (p = 0.035). Based on the current results, no definitive recommendations can be made regarding the comparative merit of the regimens tested.

Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either lenalidomide (5 mg) or placebo. Randomisation was done with a fixed block size of three, and was stratified according to the minimal residual disease level achieved after first-line therapy. Maintenance was started with 5 mg daily, and was escalated to the target dose of 15 mg. If tolerated, medication was administered until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival according to an independent review. The pre-planned interim analysis done by intention to treat was done after 20% of the calculated progression-free survival events. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01556776; treatment in the lenalidomide group is still ongoing. Between July 5, 2012, and March 15, 2016, 468 previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were screened for the study; 379 (81%) were not eligible. Recruitment was closed prematurely due to poor accrual after 89 of 200 planned patients were randomly assigned: 60 (67%) enrolled patients were assigned to the lenalidomide group and 29 (33%) to the placebo group, of whom 56 (63%) received lenalidomide and 29 (33%) placebo, with a median of 11·0 (IQR 4·5-20·5) treatment cycles at data cutoff. After a median observation time of 17·9 months (IQR 9·1-28·1), the hazard ratio for progression-free survival assessed by an independent review was 0·168 (95% CI 0·074-0·379). Median progression-free survival was 13·3 months (95% CI 9·9-19·7) in the placebo group and not reached (95% CI 32·3-not evaluable) in the lenalidomide group. The most frequent adverse events were skin disorders (35 patients [63%] in the lenalidomide group vs eight patients [28%] in the placebo group), gastrointestinal disorders (34 [61%] vs eight [28%]), infections (30 [54%] vs 19 [66%]), haematological toxicity (28 [50%] vs five [17%]), and general disorders (28 [50%] vs nine [31%]). One fatal adverse event was reported in each of the treatment groups (one [2%] patient with fatal acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the lenalidomide group and one patient (3%) with fatal multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the placebo group). Lenalidomide is an efficacious maintenance therapy reducing the relative risk of progression in first-line patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who do not achieve minimal residual disease negative disease state following chemoimmunotherapy approaches. The toxicity seems to be acceptable considering the poor prognosis of the eligible patients. The trial independently confirms the clinical significance of a novel, minimal residual disease-based algorithm to predict short progression-free survival, which might be incorporated in future clinical trials to identify candidates for additional maintenance treatment.

"Gemcitabine plus vinorelbine versus vinorelbine monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes: final results of the phase III Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM) trial. We aimed to compare the additional benefit of gemcitabine when combined with vinorelbine above that of standard vinorelbine treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In this phase III, multicentre, open-label, randomised study, 252 women with locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer who had been pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes were randomly assigned single-agent vinorelbine (30 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8) or gemcitabine plus vinorelbine (1200/30 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8). Both study treatments were administered intravenously every 21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or stoppage at the request of investigator or patient. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included assessments of response rate, disease duration, overall survival, and characterisation of the toxicity profiles of both regimens. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00128310. Between 2001 and 2005, 252 women were recruited and randomised for treatment. One of these patients was ineligible. Prognostic factors were well balanced between treatment groups (median number of metastatic sites in combination group 2 (range 0-5) and in vinorelbine group 2 (range 1-6); visceral disease in 76% and 75% of patients, respectively). Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI 4.8-7.1) for patients given gemcitabine plus vinorelbine and 4.0 months (2.9-5.1) for those assigned vinorelbine; there was 1.9 months of difference (hazard ratio 0.66 [0.50-0.88]; p=0.0028). Overall survival was 15.9 months (12.6-19.1) for the gemcitabine plus vinorelbine group and 16.4 months (11.6-21.0) for the vinorelbine group; there was 0.5 months of difference (hazard ratio 1.04 [0.78-1.39]; p=0.8046). Objective response rates were 36% for patients assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine (n=45) and 26% for those assigned vinorelbine (n=33) (p=0.093). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 75 (61% [52-70]) of the participants assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, compared with 55 (44% [35-53]) of those assigned vinorelbine alone (p=0.0074). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 13 (11%) of those assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, and in seven (6%) of those assigned vinorelbine alone (p=0.15). Incidences of grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxic effects were similar between the two treatment groups. Patients with metastatic breast cancer assigned gemcitabine and vinorelbine had better progression-free survival compared with those assigned vinorelbine alone. However, this finding did not translate into a difference in overall survival. Although toxicity was manageable, patients in the combined group had more haematological toxic effects. These factors should be taken into account when deciding which chemotherapy patients should receive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17329192/,17329192,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine compared to Vinorelbine monotherapy when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine versus Vinorelbine monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine and Vinorelbine monotherapy for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine versus Vinorelbine monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine when compared with Vinorelbine monotherapy for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine in comparison to Vinorelbine monotherapy for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine compared to Vinorelbine monotherapy for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine and Vinorelbine monotherapy in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine against Vinorelbine monotherapy for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine compared to Vinorelbine monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine contrasted with Vinorelbine monotherapy in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine versus Vinorelbine monotherapy for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine and Vinorelbine monotherapy in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine as opposed to Vinorelbine monotherapy in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine compared to Vinorelbine monotherapy in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine compares to Vinorelbine monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine in relation to Vinorelbine monotherapy for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine versus Vinorelbine monotherapy for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine's efficacy in comparison with Vinorelbine monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine against Vinorelbine monotherapy regarding Breast cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00128310,"{""17329192"": ""Miguel Martín|Amparo Ruiz|Monserrat Muñoz|Ana Balil|Jesús García-Mata|Lourdes Calvo|Eva Carrasco|Esther Mahillo|Antonio Casado|José Angel García-Saenz|M José Escudero|Vicente Guillem|Carlos Jara|Nuria Ribelles|Fernando Salas|Celia Soto|Flavia Morales-Vasquez|César A Rodríguez|Encarna Adrover|José Ramón Mel|Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM) trial""}",2001-01-18,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Antimetabolites
"Maintenance treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus observation following induction chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: GEICAM 2001-01 study. This randomized multicenter phase III trial evaluated the role of maintenance therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) after induction chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients without disease progression following first-line induction chemotherapy consisting of three cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)) followed by three cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) both every 21 days, were randomized to PLD (40 mg/m(2)) every 28 days for six cycles or to observation. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint. 288 patients were enrolled and received induction first-line chemotherapy. One hundred and fifty-five achieved response or stable disease and were randomized to maintenance PLD (n = 78) or observation (n = 77). With a median follow-up of 20 months from randomization (range 1-56), disease progression occurred in 94% of patients. PLD significantly improved TTP by 3.3 months (8.4 vs. 5.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.76, P = 0.0002) compared with observation. Overall survival was not significantly prolonged with PLD (24.8 vs. 22.0 months, respectively; HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.58-1.27, P = 0.44). PLD-induced toxicity was mild and manageable with up to 5% of patients experiencing grade 3/4 non-hematologic events (fatigue, mucositis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 12% of patients; two patients developed febrile neutropenia.

"Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) versus FAC followed by weekly paclitaxel as adjuvant therapy for high-risk, node-negative breast cancer: results from the GEICAM/2003-02 study. Adding taxanes to anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy improves survival outcomes of patients with node-positive breast cancer (BC). Currently, however, most patients with BC are node negative at diagnosis. The only pure node-negative study (Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group 9805) reported so far showed a docetaxel benefit but significant toxicity. Here we tested the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel (wP) in node-negative patients, which is yet to be established. Patients with BC having T1-T3/N0 tumors and at least one high-risk factor for recurrence (according to St. Gallen 1998 criteria) were eligible. After primary surgery, 1,925 patients were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) × 6 or FAC × 4 followed by wP × 8 (FAC-wP). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) after a median follow-up of 5 years. Secondary end points included toxicity and overall survival. After a median follow-up of 63.3 months, 93% and 90.3% of patients receiving FAC-wP or FAC regimens, respectively, remained disease free (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99; log-rank P = .04). Thirty-one patients receiving FAC-wP versus 40 patients receiving FAC died (one and seven from cardiovascular diseases, respectively; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.26; log-rank P = .31). The most relevant grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the FAC-wP versus the FAC arm were febrile neutropenia (2.7% v 3.6%), fatigue (7.9% v 3.4%), and sensory neuropathy (5.5% v 0%).

Capecitabine is an active drug in metastatic breast cancer (BC). GEICAM/2003-10 is an adjuvant trial to investigate the integration of capecitabine into a regimen of epirubicin and docetaxel for node-positive early BC. Patients with operable node-positive BC (T1-3/N1-3) were eligible. After surgery, 1,384 patients were randomly assigned to receive epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (EC; 90 and 600 mg/m(2), respectively, × four cycles), followed by docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) × four cycles; EC-T) or epirubicin plus docetaxel (ET; 90 and 75 mg/m(2), respectively, × four cycles), followed by capecitabine (1,250 mg/m(2) twice a day on days 1 to 14, × four cycles; ET-X); all regimens were given every 3 weeks. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival. Secondary end points included safety (with an alopecia-specific study) and overall survival (OS). After a median follow-up of 6.6 years and 297 events, 86% of patients who received EC-T and 82% of those who received ET-X were invasive disease free at 5 years (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.64; log-rank P = .03).

"Trastuzumab or lapatinib with standard chemotherapy for HER2-positive breast cancer: results from the GEICAM/2006-14 trial. The addition of trastuzumab (T) and lapatinib (L) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. We investigated the efficacy of T or L with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and specific efficacy biomarkers. Patients with stages I-III (including inflammatory) HER2-positive breast cancer were randomised to receive epirubicin (E) plus cyclophosphamide (C) × 4 cycles followed by docetaxel (D) plus either T (EC-DT) or L (EC-DL). End points included pCR (primary), clinical response, toxicity, and pCR-predictive biomarkers. We randomised 102 patients to EC-DT (50) and EC-DL (52). Median age was 48, 56% were premenopausal and 58% had oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumours. Pathological complete response in breast was 52.1% (95% CI:38.0-66.2%) for EC-DT and 25.5% (95% CI:13.5-37.5%) for EC-DL (P=0.0065). Pathological complete response in breast and axilla was 47.9% for EC-DT and 23.5% for EC-DL (P=0.011).

"Adjuvant docetaxel for high-risk, node-negative breast cancer. A regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) is superior to a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) when used as adjuvant therapy in women with node-positive breast cancer. The value of taxanes in the treatment of node-negative disease has not been determined. We randomly assigned 1060 women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor for recurrence (according to the 1998 St. Gallen criteria) to treatment with TAC or FAC every 3 weeks for six cycles after surgery. The primary end point was disease-free survival after at least 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. At a median follow-up of 77 months, the proportion of patients alive and disease-free was higher among the 539 women in the TAC group (87.8%) than among the 521 women in the FAC group (81.8%), representing a 32% reduction in the risk of recurrence with TAC (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.93; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). This benefit was consistent, regardless of hormone-receptor status, menopausal status, or number of high-risk factors. The difference in survival rates (TAC, 95.2%; FAC, 93.5%) was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26); however, the number of events was small (TAC, 26; FAC, 34). Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 28.2% with TAC and 17.0% with FAC (P<0.001). Toxicity associated with TAC was diminished when primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was provided. As compared with adjuvant FAC, adjuvant TAC improved the rate of disease-free survival among women with high-risk, node-negative breast cancer.

"Randomized phase 3 trial of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide alone or followed by Paclitaxel for early breast cancer. Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and, as a consequence, they have also been studied in the adjuvant setting. After breast cancer surgery, women with lymph node-positive disease were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) or with FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel (FEC-P). The primary endpoint of study-5-year disease-free survival (DFS)-was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of clinical and molecular (hormone receptors by immunohistochemistry and HER2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers. Associations and interactions were assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following covariates: age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node status, type of chemotherapy, tumor size, positive lymph nodes, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided. Among the 1246 eligible patients, estimated rates of DFS at 5 years were 78.5% in the FEC-P arm and 72.1% in the FEC arm (difference = 6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6% to 11.2%; P = .006). FEC-P treatment was associated with a 23% reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment (146 relapses in the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm vs 193 relapses in the 632 patients in the FEC arm, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.95; P = .022) and a 22% reduction in the risk of death (73 and 95 deaths, respectively, HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.06; P = .110). Among the 928 patients for whom tumor samples were centrally analyzed, type of chemotherapy (FEC vs FEC-P) (P = .017), number of involved axillary lymph nodes (P < .001), tumor size (P = .020), hormone receptor status (P = .004), and HER2 status (P = .006) were all associated with DFS. We found no statistically significant interaction between HER2 status and paclitaxel treatment or between hormone receptor status and paclitaxel treatment. Among patients with operable breast cancer, FEC-P treatment statistically significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with FEC as adjuvant therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18505968/,18505968,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of FEC-P compared to FEC when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of FEC-P versus FEC in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of FEC-P and FEC for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of FEC-P versus FEC in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of FEC-P when compared with FEC for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of FEC-P in comparison to FEC for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of FEC-P compared to FEC for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of FEC-P and FEC in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of FEC-P against FEC for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of FEC-P compared to FEC in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of FEC-P contrasted with FEC in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of FEC-P versus FEC for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of FEC-P and FEC in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of FEC-P as opposed to FEC in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of FEC-P compared to FEC in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how FEC-P compares to FEC in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of FEC-P in relation to FEC for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of FEC-P versus FEC for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of FEC-P's efficacy in comparison with FEC in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of FEC-P against FEC regarding Breast cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00129922,"{""18505968"": ""Miguel Martín|Alvaro Rodríguez-Lescure|Amparo Ruiz|Emilio Alba|Lourdes Calvo|Manuel Ruiz-Borrego|Blanca Munárriz|César A Rodríguez|Carmen Crespo|Enrique de Alava|José Antonio López García-Asenjo|María Dolores Guitián|Sergio Almenar|Jesús Fernando González-Palacios|Francisco Vera|José Palacios|Manuel Ramos|Jose Manuel Gracia Marco|Ana Lluch|Isabel Alvarez|Miguel Angel Seguí|José Ignacio Mayordomo|Antonio Antón|José Manuel Baena|Arrate Plazaola|Alfonso Modolell|Amadeu Pelegrí|Jose Ramón Mel|Enrique Aranda|Encarna Adrover|José Valero Alvarez|José Luis García Puche|Pedro Sánchez-Rovira|Sonia Gonzalez|José Manuel López-Vega|GEICAM 9906 Study Investigators""}",1999-11,Yes,Yes,Oral,Antimetabolites|Cdk4/6 Inhibitors|Chemotherapy|Taxanes
"Ublituximab plus ibrutinib versus ibrutinib alone for patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (GENUINE): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and high-risk features have poorer outcomes on ibrutinib than those without high-risk features. The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of adding ublituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to ibrutinib therapy in this population. We did a randomised, phase 3, multicentre study (GENUINE) of patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with at least one of 17p deletion, 11q deletion, or TP53 mutation, at 119 clinics in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients had received at least one previous chronic lymphocytic leukaemia therapy and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or lower. We randomised patients (1:1) using permuted block randomisation with a block size of four and stratified by previous lines of therapy (one vs two or more) to receive ibrutinib alone or ibrutinib in combination with ublituximab. Treatment allocation was not masked to patients or investigators. Ibrutinib was given orally daily at 420 mg for all cycles. Ublituximab was given intravenously in 28-day cycles, with increasing doses during cycle 1 (≤150 mg on day 1, 750 mg on day 2, and 900 mg on days 8 and 15) and continuing at 900 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6. After cycle 6, ublituximab was given at 900 mg every three cycles. The study was initially designed with co-primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall response rate but due to protracted patient accrual, the protocol was amended to have a single primary endpoint of independent review committee-assessed overall response rate (defined as the proportion of patients who had a partial response, complete response, or complete response with incomplete marrow recovery according to the 2008 International Workshop on CLL criteria) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was evaluated in the population of patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02301156, and the final analysis is presented. 224 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 126 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ublituximab plus ibrutinib (n=64) or ibrutinib alone (n=62) between Feb 6, 2015, and Dec 19, 2016. After a median follow-up of 41·6 months (IQR 36·7-47·3), the overall response rate was 53 (83%) of 64 patients in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and 40 (65%) of 62 patients in the ibrutinib group (p=0·020). 117 patients, including 59 in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and 58 in the ibrutinib group, received at least one dose of treatment and were included in safety analyses. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (11 [19%] patients in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and seven [12%] in the ibrutinib group), anaemia (five [8%] and five [9%]), and diarrhoea (six [10%] and three [5%]). The most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (six [10%] in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group and four [7%] in the ibrutinib group), atrial fibrillation (four [7%] and one [2%]), sepsis (four [7%] and one [2%]), and febrile neutropenia (three [5%] and one [2%]). Two patients in the ublituximab plus ibrutinib group died due to adverse events (one cardiac arrest and one failure to thrive), neither of which were treatment-related. Five patients in the ibrutinib group died due to adverse events, including one cardiac arrest, one cerebral infarction, one intracranial haemorrhage, one Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia infection, and one unexplained death; the death due to cardiac arrest was considered to be treatment-related. The addition of ublituximab to ibrutinib resulted in a statistically higher overall response rate without affecting the safety profile of ibrutinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These findings provide support for the addition of ublituximab to Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of these patients.

"Lenalidomide with or without erythropoietin in transfusion-dependent erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-refractory lower-risk MDS without 5q deletion. After failure of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), lenalidomide (LEN) yields red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (TI) in 20-30% of lower-risk non-del5q myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Several observations suggest an additive effect of ESA and LEN in this situation. We performed a randomized phase III study in 131 RBC transfusion-dependent (TD, median transfusion requirement six RBC units per 8 weeks) lower-risk ESA-refractory non-del5q MDS. Patients received LEN alone, 10 mg per day, 21 days per 4 weeks (L arm) or LEN (same schedule) + erythropoietin (EPO) beta, 60,000 U per week (LE arm). In an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, erythroid response (HI-E, IWG 2006 criteria) after four treatment cycles (primary end point) was 23.1% (95% CI 13.5-35.2) in the L arm and 39.4% (95% CI 27.6-52.2) in the LE arm (P=0.044), while RBC-TI was reached in 13.8 and 24.2% of the patients in the L and LE arms, respectively (P=0.13). Median response duration was 18.1 and 15.1 months in the L and LE arms, respectively (P=0.47). Side effects were moderate and similar in the two arms. Low baseline serum EPO level and a G polymorphism of CRBN gene predicted HI-E.

"Melphalan 200 mg/m(2) versus melphalan 100 mg/m(2) in newly diagnosed myeloma patients: a prospective, multicenter phase 3 study. High-dose (200 mg/m(2), MEL200) and intermediate-dose melphalan (100 mg/m(2), MEL100) showed significant activity in myeloma. In a phase 3 study, 298 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 autologous transplantations after conditioning with MEL200 or MEL100. Ninety-six of 149 (64%) completed MEL200 and 103 of 149 (69%) MEL100. Best response to MEL200 was: complete remission 22 of 149 (15%); partial remission 95 of 149 (64%), for an overall response rate of 79%. Best response to MEL100 was: complete remission 12 of 149 (8%); partial remission 95 of 149 (64%), for an overall response rate of 72%. Overall survival did not differ (P = .13); median progression-free survival (31.4 vs 26.2 months, P = .01), median time to progression (34.4 vs 27.0 months, P = .014) were longer in the MEL200. Treatment-related mortality was 3.1% in the MEL200 and 2.9% in the MEL100 group.

"Bevacizumab Plus Irinotecan Versus Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase Nonmethylated Glioblastoma: The Randomized GLARIUS Trial. In patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma that harbors a nonmethylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promotor, standard temozolomide (TMZ) has, at best, limited efficacy. The GLARIUS trial thus explored bevacizumab plus irinotecan (BEV+IRI) as an alternative to TMZ. In this phase II, unblinded trial 182 patients in 22 centers were randomly assigned 2:1 to BEV (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) during radiotherapy (RT) followed by maintenance BEV (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) plus IRI(125 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks) or to daily TMZ (75 mg/m(2)) during RT followed by six courses of TMZ (150-200 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 4 weeks). The primary end point was the progression-free survival rate after 6 months (PFS-6). In the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population, PFS-6 was increased from 42.6% with TMZ (95% CI, 29.4% to 55.8%) to 79.3% with BEV+IRI (95% CI, 71.9% to 86.7%; P <.001). PFS was prolonged from a median of 5.99 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 7.3 months) to 9.7 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 10.8 months; P < .001). At progression, crossover BEV therapy was given to 81.8% of all patients who received any sort of second-line therapy in the TMZ arm. Overall survival (OS) was not different in the two arms: the median OS was 16.6 months (95% CI, 15.4 to 18.4 months) with BEV+IRI and was 17.5 months (95% CI, 15.1 to 20.5 months) with TMZ. The time course of quality of life (QOL) in six selected domains of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ) -C30 and QLQ-BN20 (which included cognitive functioning), of the Karnofsky performance score, and of the Mini Mental State Examination score was not different between the treatment arms.

"Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Radiotherapy vs Chemoradiotherapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma but is associated with higher rates of acute toxic effects and low compliance. Evidence on de-escalating treatment intensity after induction chemotherapy is limited. To assess if radiotherapy was noninferior to chemoradiotherapy after induction chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. From April 2015 to March 2018, a multicenter, open-label, randomized, noninferiority, phase 3 trial was conducted at 5 Chinese hospitals. A total of 383 patients aged 18 to 70 years with an untreated histologically confirmed nonkeratinizing tumor, Karnofsky performance status score not worse than 70, proper organ function, and stage III to IVB nasopharyngeal cancer were enrolled. Data were analyzed from April 2023 to June 2023. Patients were assigned randomly. Both groups received 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy consisting of intravenous administration (on day 1) of cisplatin at 60 mg/m2 and docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 and continuous intravenous infusion (from day 1 to day 5) of daily fluorouracil (600 mg/m2), repeated every 21 days. Subsequently, the patients received radiotherapy alone (induction chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy [IC-RT] group) or concomitant cisplatin (30 mg/m2/week) with radiotherapy for 6 to 7 weeks (induction chemotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy [IC-CCRT] group). The primary end point was 3-year progression-free survival (time from the initiation of therapy until the first indication of disease progression or death), with a noninferiority margin of 10%. The secondary end points included overall survival, locoregional failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, response rate, and toxic effects. A total of 383 patients (median [range] age, 48 [19-70] years; 100 women [26%]). Median follow-up time was 76 months (IQR, 70-89 months). The 3-year progression-free survival was 76.2% and 76.8% in the IC-RT (n = 193) and IC-CCRT groups (n = 190), respectively, in the intention-to-treat population, showing a difference of 0.6% (95% CI, -7.9% to 9.1%; P = .01 for noninferiority). Identical outcomes were reported in the per-protocol population. The incidence of grade 3 to 4 short-term toxic effects in the IC-RT group was less than the IC-CCRT group. No differences were observed in late toxic effects. The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that after induction chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, radiotherapy alone was noninferior to chemoradiotherapy in terms of 3-year progression-free survival.

"Phase III trial of weekly methotrexate or pulsed dactinomycin for low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: a gynecologic oncology group study. There is no consensus on the best regimen for the primary treatment of low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Two commonly used single-drug regimens were compared with respect to the proportion of patients meeting the criteria for a complete response (CR) in a randomized phase III trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group. Eligibility was purposefully broad to maximize the generalizability of the results and included patients with a WHO risk score of 0 to 6 and patients with metastatic disease (limited to lung lesions < 2 cm, adnexa, or vagina) or choriocarcinoma. Two hundred forty women were enrolled, and 216 were deemed eligible. Biweekly intravenous dactinomycin 1.25 mg/m² was statistically superior to weekly intramuscular (IM) methotrexate 30 mg/m² (CR: 70% v 53%; P = .01). Similarly, in patients with low-risk GTN as defined before the 2002 WHO risk score revisions (risk score of 0 to 4 and excluding choriocarcinoma), response was 58% and 73% in the methotrexate and dactinomycin arms, respectively (P = .03). Both regimens were less effective if the WHO risk score was 5 or 6 or if the diagnosis was choriocarcinoma (CR: 9% and 42%, respectively). There were two potential recurrences; one at 4 months (dactinomycin) and one at 22 months (methotrexate). Not all patients completed follow-up. Both regimens were well tolerated.

"A gynecologic oncology group randomized phase III trial of whole abdominal irradiation (WAI) vs. cisplatin-ifosfamide and mesna (CIM) as post-surgical therapy in stage I-IV carcinosarcoma (CS) of the uterus. After initial surgery, there has been no established consensus regarding adjunctive therapy for patients with uterine carcinosarcoma (CS). This study was designed to compare patient outcome following treatment with adjuvant whole abdominal irradiation (WAI) versus (vs.) chemotherapy for patients with this rare group of female pelvic malignancies. Eligible, consenting women with stage I-IV uterine CS, no more than 1 cm postsurgical residuum and/or no extra-abdominal spread had their treatments randomly assigned as either WAI or three cycles of cisplatin (C), ifosfamide (I), and mesna (M). 232 patients were enrolled, of whom 206 (WAI=105; CIM=101) were deemed eligible. Patient demographics and characteristics were similar between arms. FIGO stage (both arms) was: I=64 (31%); II=26 (13%); III=92 (45%); IV=24 (12%). The estimated crude probability of recurring within 5 years was 58% (WAI) and 52% (CIM).

"Randomized comparison of weekly cisplatin or protracted venous infusion of fluorouracil in combination with pelvic radiation in advanced cervix cancer: a gynecologic oncology group study. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced cervix cancer; the optimal chemotherapy regimen is not yet defined. This trial was designed to compare the outcome of protracted venous infusion (PVI) fluorouracil (FU) with standard weekly cisplatin and concurrent radiation therapy (RT). Patients with stage IIB, IIIB, and IVA cervical cancer with clinically negative aortic nodes were eligible. Pelvic RT dose was 45 Gy with a parametrial boost to involved sides of 5.4 to 9 Gy, and high- or low-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy. Standard therapy was weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2, and experimental therapy was PVI FU 225 mg/m2/d for 5 d/wk for six cycles during RT. The study was closed prematurely when a planned interim futility analysis indicated that PVI FU/RT had a higher treatment failure rate (35% higher) and would, most likely, not result in an improvement in progression-free survival compared with weekly cisplatin/RT. The PVI FU/RT arm continues to show a higher risk of treatment failure (relative risk [RR] unadjusted, 1.29) and a higher mortality rate (RR unadjusted, 1.37).

"Phase III trial of doxorubicin plus cisplatin with or without paclitaxel plus filgrastim in advanced endometrial carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study. To determine whether the addition of paclitaxel to doxorubicin plus cisplatin improves overall survival (OS) in women with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. Secondary comparisons included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and toxicities. Eligible, consenting patients received doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) (AP), or doxorubicin 45 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) (day 1), followed by paclitaxel 160 mg/m(2) (day 2) with filgrastim support (TAP). The initial doxorubicin dose in the AP arm was reduced to 45 mg/m(2) in patients with prior pelvic radiotherapy and those older than 65 years. Both regimens were repeated every 3 weeks to a maximum of seven cycles. Patients completed a neurotoxicity questionnaire before each cycle. Two hundred seventy-three women (10 ineligible) were registered. Objective response (57% v 34%; P <.01), PFS (median, 8.3 v 5.3 months; P <.01), and OS (median, 15.3 v 12.3 months; P =.037) were improved with TAP. Treatment was hematologically well tolerated, with only 2% of patients receiving AP, and 3% of patients receiving TAP experiencing neutropenic fever. Neurologic toxicity was worse for those receiving TAP, with 12% grade 3, and 27% grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, compared with 1% and 4%, respectively, in those receiving AP. Patient-reported neurotoxicity was significantly higher in the TAP arm following two cycles of therapy. TAP significantly improves RR, PFS, and OS compared with AP. Evaluation of this regimen in the high-risk adjuvant setting is warranted, but close attention should be paid to the increased risk of peripheral neuropathy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15169803/,15169803,"Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel compared to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin when used to treat Endometrial cancer.","Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel versus Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in treating Endometrial cancer.","Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel and Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for managing Endometrial cancer?","Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel versus Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in treating Endometrial cancer.","Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel when compared with Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for Endometrial cancer?","Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel in comparison to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for the treatment of Endometrial cancer.","Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel compared to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for addressing Endometrial cancer.","Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel and Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in the treatment of Endometrial cancer?","Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel against Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for managing Endometrial cancer.","Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel compared to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in treating Endometrial cancer.","What option best characterizes the efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel contrasted with Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in relation to Endometrial cancer?","Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel versus Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for treating Endometrial cancer.","Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel and Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in treating Endometrial cancer?","Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel as opposed to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in managing Endometrial cancer.","Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel compared to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in the context of Endometrial cancer.","What option most accurately summarizes how Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel compares to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in terms of effectiveness for Endometrial cancer?","Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel in relation to Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for the treatment of Endometrial cancer.","Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel versus Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for managing Endometrial cancer?","Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel's efficacy in comparison with Cisplatin and Doxorubicin in treating Endometrial cancer.","Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel against Cisplatin and Doxorubicin regarding Endometrial cancer.",1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003691,"{""15169803"": ""Gini F Fleming|Virginia L Brunetto|David Cella|Katherine Y Look|Gary C Reid|Adnan R Munkarah|Richard Kline|Robert A Burger|Annekathryn Goodman|R Tucker Burks""}",1998-12,No,No,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy|Taxanes
"Randomized phase III trial of cisplatin with or without topotecan in carcinoma of the uterine cervix: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study. On the basis of reported activity of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) or topotecan plus cisplatin in advanced cervix cancer, we undertook a randomized trial comparing these combinations versus cisplatin alone, to determine whether survival is improved with either combination compared with cisplatin alone, and to compare toxicities and quality of life (QOL) among the regimens. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (CPT); cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) day 1 plus topotecan 0.75 mg/m(2) days 1 to 3 every 3 weeks (CT); or methotrexate 30 mg/m(2) days 1, 15, and 22, vinblastine 3 mg/m(2) days 2, 15, and 22, doxorubicin 30 mg/m(2) day 2, and cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) day 2 every 4 weeks (MVAC).

"Olaparib in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed following first-line therapy (GOLD): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Olaparib combined with paclitaxel has previously shown a significant improvement in overall survival versus placebo plus paclitaxel as second-line therapy in a phase 2 study in Asian patients with advanced gastric cancer, especially in those with ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM)-negative tumours. Here, we report the primary efficacy and safety analyses from a subsequent phase 3 trial. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (GOLD) recruited Asian patients aged 18 years or older (≥20 years if Japanese) with advanced gastric cancer that had progressed following, or during, first-line chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral olaparib (100 mg twice daily) plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously) or matching placebo plus paclitaxel. Randomisation was done through an interactive voice response system and no stratification factors were used. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Two co-primary populations were assessed: the overall population of all patients and patients whose tumours were ATM-negative (identified after randomisation, before the data cutoff date, March 28, 2016). The primary endpoint in both populations was overall survival (defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death from any cause before data cutoff); a significant difference was defined as p<0·025. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat populations and safety in patients who received at least one dose of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01924533 (study ID, D081BC00004), and is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants. Between Sept 3, 2013, and March 28, 2016, 643 patients were enrolled from 58 study sites in hospitals and medical centres in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 525 eligible patients were randomly assigned: 263 to receive olaparib plus paclitaxel and 262 to receive placebo plus paclitaxel. 94 patients were determined to have ATM-negative tumours before unmasking for the primary analysis (48 in the olaparib plus paclitaxel group and 46 in the placebo plus paclitaxel group). Overall survival did not differ between treatment groups in the overall patient population (median overall survival 8·8 months [95% CI 7·4-9·6] in the olaparib group vs 6·9 months [6·3-7·9] in the placebo group; HR 0·79 [97·5% CI 0·63-1·00]; p=0·026) or in the ATM-negative population (12·0 months [7·8-18·1] vs 10·0 months [6·4-13·3]; 0·73 [0·40-1·34]; p=0·25). In the overall patient population, the most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the olaparib plus paclitaxel group were neutropenia (78 [30%] of 262 patients), leucopenia (42 [16%]), and decreased neutrophil count (40 [15%]); in the placebo plus paclitaxel group, they were neutropenia (59 [23%] of 259 patients), leucopenia (27 [10%]), and decreased white blood cell count (21 [8%]). Adverse events with an outcome of death causally related to study treatment (according to investigator assessment) were reported in two patients: liver injury in one patient (<1%) in the olaparib plus paclitaxel group and cardiac failure in one patient (<1%) in the placebo plus paclitaxel group. The GOLD study did not meet its primary objective of showing a significant improvement in overall survival with olaparib in the overall or ATM-negative population of Asian patients with advanced gastric cancer. The study generated informative efficacy and safety data regarding the use of olaparib in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent and provides a foundation for future studies in this difficult-to-treat patient population.

The Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest (GONO) conducted a phase III study comparing fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI [irinotecan 165 mg/m2 day 1, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 day 1, leucovorin 200 mg/m2 day 1, fluorouracil 3,200 mg/m2 48-hour continuous infusion starting on day 1, every 2 weeks]) with infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). Selection criteria included unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, age 18 to 75 years, and no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. The primary end point was response rate (RR). A total of 244 patients were randomly assigned. An increase of grade 2 to 3 peripheral neurotoxicity (0% v 19%; P < .001), and grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (28% v 50%; P < .001) were observed in the FOLFOXIRI arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (3% v 5%) and grade 3 to 4 diarrhea (12% v 20%) were not significantly different. Responses, as assessed by investigators, were, for FOLFIRI and FOLFOXIRI, respectively, complete, 6% and 8%; and partial, 35% and 58%, (RR, 41% v 66%; P = .0002). RR confirmed by an external panel was 34% versus 60% (P < .0001). The R0 secondary resection rate of metastases was greater in the FOLFOXIRI arm (6% v 15%; P = .033, among all 244 patients; and 12% v 36%; P = .017 among patients with liver metastases only).

"Improved Outcome by Adding Concurrent Chemotherapy to Cetuximab and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Carcinomas: Results of the GORTEC 2007-01 Phase III Randomized Trial. Purpose To investigate the effect of adding concurrent chemotherapy (CT) to cetuximab plus radiotherapy (RT; CT-cetux-RT) compared with cetuximab plus RT (cetux-RT) in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). Patients and Methods In this phase III randomized trial, patients with N0-2b, nonoperated, stage III or IV (nonmetastatic) LA-SCCHN were enrolled. Patients received once-daily RT up to 70 Gy with weekly cetuximab or with weekly cetuximab and concurrent carboplatin and fluorouracil (three cycles). To detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64 for progression-free survival (PFS) with 85% power at a two-sided significance level of P = .05, 203 patients needed to be included in each arm. Results Four hundred six patients were randomly assigned to either CT-cetux-RT or cetux-RT. Patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced between arms, including p16 status. With a median follow-up of 4.4 years, the HR for PFS favored the CT-cetux-RT arm (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.94; P = .015), with 3-year PFS rates of 52.3% and 40.5% and median PFS times of 37.9 and 22.4 months in the CT-cetux-RT and cetux-RT arms, respectively. The HR for locoregional control was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.76; P < .001) in favor of CT-cetux-RT. These benefits were observed regardless of p16 status for oropharynx carcinomas. Overall survival (HR, 0.80; P = .11) and distant metastases rates (HR, 1.19; P = .50) were not significantly different between the two arms. The CT-cetux-RT arm, compared with cetux-RT, had a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (73% v 61%, respectively; P = .014) and of hospitalizations for toxicity (42% v 22%, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion The addition of concurrent carboplatin and fluorouracil to cetux-RT improved PFS and locoregional control, with a nonsignificant gain in survival.

"Concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus acceleration of radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (GORTEC 99-02): an open-label phase 3 randomised trial. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy and accelerated radiotherapy independently improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a combination of these approaches. In our open-label phase 3 randomised trial, we enrolled patients with locally advanced, stage III and IV (non-metastatic) HNSCC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. We randomly allocated patients centrally with a computer program (with centre, T stage, N stage, and localisation as minimisation factors) in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive conventional chemoradiotherapy (70 Gy in 7 weeks plus three cycles of 4 days' concomitant carboplatin-fluorouracil), accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy (70 Gy in 6 weeks plus two cycles of 5 days' concomitant carboplatin-fluorouracil), or very accelerated radiotherapy alone (64·8 Gy [1·8 Gy twice daily] in 3·5 weeks). The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed in all enrolled patients. This trial is completed. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00828386. Between Feb 29, 2000, and May 9, 2007, we randomly allocated 279 patients to receive conventional chemoradiotherapy, 280 to accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy, and 281 to very accelerated radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 5·2 years (IQR 4·9-6·2); rates of chemotherapy and radiotherapy compliance were good in all groups. Accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy offered no PFS benefit compared with conventional chemoradiotherapy (HR 1·02, 95% CI 0·84-1·23; p=0·88) or very accelerated radiotherapy (0·83, 0·69-1·01; p=0·060); conventional chemoradiotherapy improved PFS compared with very accelerated radiotherapy (0·82, 0·67-0·99; p=0·041). 3-year PFS was 37·6% (95% CI 32·1-43·4) after conventional chemoradiotherapy, 34·1% (28·7-39·8) after accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy, and 32·2% (27·0-37·9) after very accelerated radiotherapy. More patients in the very accelerated radiotherapy group had RTOG grade 3-4 acute mucosal toxicity (226 [84%] of 268 patients) compared with accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy (205 [76%] of 271 patients) or conventional chemoradiotherapy (180 [69%] of 262; p=0·0001). 158 (60%) of 265 patients in the conventional chemoradiotherapy group, 176 (64%) of 276 patients in the accelerated radiotherapy-chemotherapy group, and 190 (70%) of 272 patients in the very accelerated radiotherapy group were intubated with feeding tubes during treatment (p=0·045). Chemotherapy has a substantial treatment effect given concomitantly with radiotherapy and acceleration of radiotherapy cannot compensate for the absence of chemotherapy. We noted the most favourable outcomes for conventional chemoradiotherapy, suggesting that acceleration of radiotherapy is probably not beneficial in concomitant chemoradiotherapy schedules.

"An Open-Label, Randomized, Parallel, Phase III Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Polymeric Micelle-Formulated Paclitaxel Compared to Conventional Cremophor EL-Based Paclitaxel for Recurrent or Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Cancer. Genexol-PM is a Cremophor EL-free formulation of low-molecular-weight, non-toxic, and biodegradable polymeric micelle-bound paclitaxel. We conducted a phase III study comparing the clinical efficacy and toxicity of Genexol-PM with conventional paclitaxel (Genexol). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive Genexol-PM 260 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or Genexol 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every 3 weeks. The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR). The study enrolled 212 patients, of whom 105 were allocated to receive Genexol-PM. The mean received dose intensity of Genexol-PM was 246.8±21.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (95.0%), and that of Genexol was 168.3±10.6 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (96.2%). After a median follow-up of 24.5 months (range, 0.0 to 48.7 months), the ORR of Genexol-PM was 39.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31.2 to 46.9) and the ORR of Genexol was 24.3% (95% CI, 17.5 to 31.1) (p<sub>non-inferiority</sub>=0.021, p<sub>superiority</sub>=0.016). The two groups did not differ significantly in overall survival (28.8 months for Genexol-PM vs. 23.8 months for Genexol; p=0.52) or progression-free survival (8.0 months for Genexol-PM vs. 6.7 months for Genexol; p=0.26). In both groups, the most common toxicities were neutropenia, with 68.6% occurrence in the Genexol-PM group versus 40.2% in the Genexol group (p < 0.01). The incidences of peripheral neuropathy of greater than grade 2 did not differ significantly between study treatments.

"Phase III study comparing oral topotecan to intravenous docetaxel in patients with pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. This open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase III study compared oral topotecan versus intravenous (IV) docetaxel in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with stage III or IV NSCLC, performance status < or = 2, who had received only one prior chemotherapy regimen, were randomly assigned to treatment with oral topotecan 2.3 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5 or IV docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day 1 every 21 days. A total of 829 patients were randomly assigned. In intent-to-treat analysis, 1-year survival rates were 25.1% with topotecan and 28.7% with docetaxel. The difference of -3.6% (95% CI, -9.59% to 2.48%) met the predefined criteria for noninferiority of topotecan relative to docetaxel because the lower limit of the 95% CI was above -10%. Median survival was 27.9 weeks with topotecan and 30.7 weeks with docetaxel. Although not statistically significant (log-rank P = .057), the higher survival rate with docetaxel was maintained across the entire treatment period. The median time to progression was 11.3 weeks with topotecan versus 13.1 weeks with docetaxel (log-rank P = .02). The overall response rate was 5% in each group.

"Topotecan/cisplatin compared with cisplatin/etoposide as first-line treatment for patients with extensive disease small-cell lung cancer: final results of a randomized phase III trial. This phase III study compared efficacy and safety of topotecan-cisplatin (TP) versus topotecan-etoposide (TE) versus cisplatin-etoposide (PE) in chemo-naïve extensive disease small-cell lung cancer patients. Seven hundred and ninety-five previously untreated patients were randomly assigned to TP (topotecan 1mg/m IV, d1-5; cisplatin 75 mg/m IV, d5; n = 358), PE (cisplatin 75 mg/m IV, d1; etoposide 100 mg/m IV, d1-3; n = 345) or TE (topotecan 1mg/m IV, d1-5; etoposide 80 mg/m IV, d3-5; n = 92). Primary endpoint was superiority of TP compared with PE, with the possibility to switch to a noninferiority test. The TE arm was closed after recommendations by the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. Median survival was similar and met the predefined endpoint of noninferiority of TP to PE (44.9 versus 40.9 weeks; p = 0.40). One-year survival rate showed 39.7% for TP versus 36.1% for PE (p = 0.29). Median time to progression was significantly longer with TP (27.4 versus 24.3 weeks, p = 0.01).

"Phase III trial comparing supportive care alone with supportive care with oral topotecan in patients with relapsed small-cell lung cancer. For patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), further chemotherapy is routinely considered at relapse after first-line therapy. However, proof of clinical benefit has not been documented. This study randomly assigned patients with relapsed SCLC not considered as candidates for standard intravenous therapy to best supportive care (BSC) alone (n = 70) or oral topotecan (2.3 mg/m2/d, days 1 through 5, every 21 days) plus BSC (topotecan; n = 71). In the intent-to-treat population, survival (primary end point) was prolonged in the topotecan group (log-rank P = .0104). Median survival with BSC was 13.9 weeks (95% CI, 11.1 to 18.6) and with topotecan, 25.9 weeks (95% CI, 18.3 to 31.6). Statistical significance for survival was maintained in a subgroup of patients with a short treatment-free interval (< or = 60 days). Response to topotecan was 7% partial and 44% stable disease. Patients on topotecan had slower quality of life deterioration and greater symptom control. Principal toxicities with topotecan were hematological: grade 4 neutropenia, 33%; grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 7%; and grade 3/4 anemia, 25%. Comparing topotecan with BSC, infection grade 2 was 14% versus 12% and sepsis 4% versus 1%; other grade 3/4 events included vomiting 3% versus 0, diarrhea 6% versus 0, dyspnea 3% versus 9%, and pain 3% versus 6%. Toxic deaths occurred in four patients (6%) in the topotecan arm. All cause mortality within 30 days of random assignment was 13% on BSC and 7% on topotecan.

"ABVD versus BEACOPP for Hodgkin's lymphoma when high-dose salvage is planned. BEACOPP, an intensified regimen consisting of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone, has been advocated as the new standard of treatment for advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, in place of the combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). We randomly assigned 331 patients with previously untreated and unfavorable Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage IIB, III, or IV, or an international prognostic score of ≥3 on a scale of 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating increased risk), to receive either BEACOPP or ABVD, each followed by local radiotherapy when indicated. Patients with residual or progressive disease after the initial therapy were to be treated according to a state-of-the-art high-dose salvage program. The median follow-up period was 61 months. The 7-year rate of freedom from first progression was 85% among patients who had received initial treatment with BEACOPP and 73% among those who had received initial treatment with ABVD (P=0.004), and the 7-year rate of event-free survival was 78% and 71%, respectively (P=0.15). A total of 65 patients (20 in the BEACOPP group, and 45 in the ABVD group) went on to receive the intended high-dose salvage regimen. As of the cutoff date, 3 of the 20 patients in the BEACOPP group and 15 of the 45 in the ABVD group who had had progressive disease or relapse after the initial therapy were alive and free of disease. After completion of the overall planned treatment, including salvage therapy, the 7-year rate of freedom from a second progression was 88% in the BEACOPP group and 82% in the ABVD group (P=0.12), and the 7-year rate of overall survival was 89% and 84%, respectively (P=0.39). Severe adverse events occurred more frequently in the BEACOPP group than in the ABVD group. Treatment with BEACOPP, as compared with ABVD, resulted in better initial tumor control, but the long-term clinical outcome did not differ significantly between the two regimens.

"Induction TPF followed by concomitant treatment versus concomitant treatment alone in locally advanced head and neck cancer. A phase II-III trial. Platinum-based chemoradiation (CCRT) is the standard treatment for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous-Cell Carcinoma (LAHNSCC). Cetuximab/RT (CET/RT) is an alternative treatment option to CCRT. The efficacy of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by chemoradiation compared to chemoradiation alone has not been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials. The goals of this phase II-III trial were to assess: (i) the overall survival (OS) of IC versus no-induction (no-IC) and (ii) the Grade 3-4 in-field mucosal toxicity of CCRT versus CET/RT. The present paper focuses on the analysis of efficacy. Patients with LAHNSCC were randomized to receive concomitant treatment alone [CCRT (Arm A1) or CET/RT (Arm A2)], or three cycles of induction docetaxel/cisplatin/5 fluorouracil (TPF) followed by CCRT (Arm B1) or followed by CET/RT (Arm B2). The superiority hypothesis of OS comparison of IC versus no-IC (Arms B1 + B2 versus A1 + A2) required 204 deaths to detect an absolute 3-year OS difference of 12% (HR 0.675, with 80% power at two-sided 5% significance level). 414 out of 421 patients were finally analyzed: 206 in the IC and 208 in the no-IC arm. Six patients were excluded because of major violation and one because of metastatic disease at diagnosis. With a median follow-up of 44.8 months, OS was significantly higher in the IC arm (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.56-0.97; P = 0.031). Complete Responses (P = 0.0028), Progression Free Survival (P = 0.013) and the Loco-regional Control (P = 0.036) were also significantly higher in the IC arm. Compliance to concomitant treatments was not affected by induction TPF. IC followed by concomitant treatment improved the outcome of patients with LAHNSCC without compromising compliance to the concomitant treatments. The degree of the benefit of IC could be different according to the type of the subsequent concomitant strategy.

"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and bevacizumab for HER2-negative breast cancer. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A, has shown clinical efficacy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer. We evaluated the efficacy, measured according to the rate of pathological complete response (absence of invasive and intraductal disease in the breast and the axillary lymph nodes), and the safety of adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer. We randomly assigned 1948 patients with a median tumor size of 40 mm on palpation to receive neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, with or without concomitant bevacizumab. Patients with untreated HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible if they had large tumors, hormone-receptor-negative disease, or hormone-receptor-positive disease with palpable nodes or positive findings on sentinel-node biopsy, and no increased cardiovascular or bleeding risk. Overall, the rates of pathological complete response were 14.9% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and 18.4% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus bevacizumab (odds ratio with addition of bevacizumab, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.65; P=0.04); the corresponding rates of pathological complete response were 27.9% and 39.3% among 663 patients with triple-negative tumors (P=0.003) and 7.8% and 7.7% among 1262 patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumors (P=1.00). Breast-conserving surgery was possible in 66.6% of the patients in both groups. The addition of bevacizumab, as compared with neoadjuvant therapy alone, was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxic effects (febrile neutropenia, mucositis, the hand-foot syndrome, infection, and hypertension) but with a similar incidence of surgical complications. The addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased the rate of pathological complete response among patients with HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. Efficacy was restricted primarily to patients with triple-negative tumors, in whom the pathological complete response is considered to be a reliable predictor of long-term outcome.

"Emicizumab Prophylaxis in Patients Who Have Hemophilia A without Inhibitors. Emicizumab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that bridges activated factor IX and factor X to replace the function of missing activated factor VIII, thereby restoring hemostasis. In a phase 3, multicenter trial, we investigated its use as prophylaxis in persons who have hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. We randomly assigned, in a 2:2:1 ratio, participants 12 years of age or older who had been receiving episodic treatment with factor VIII to receive a subcutaneous maintenance dose of emicizumab of 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per week (group A) or 3.0 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (group B) or no prophylaxis (group C). The primary end point was the difference in rates of treated bleeding (group A vs. group C and group B vs. group C). Participants who had been receiving factor VIII prophylaxis received emicizumab at a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per kilogram per week (group D); intraindividual comparisons were performed in those who had participated in a noninterventional study. A total of 152 participants were enrolled. The annualized bleeding rate was 1.5 events (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 2.5) in group A and 1.3 events (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3) in group B, as compared with 38.2 events (95% CI, 22.9 to 63.8) in group C; thus, the rate was 96% lower in group A and 97% lower in group B (P<0.001 for both comparisons). A total of 56% of the participants in group A and 60% of those in group B had no treated bleeding events, as compared with those in group C, who all had treated bleeding events. In the intraindividual comparison involving 48 participants, emicizumab prophylaxis resulted in an annualized bleeding rate that was 68% lower than the rate with previous factor VIII prophylaxis (P<0.001). The most frequent adverse event was low-grade injection-site reaction. There were no thrombotic or thrombotic microangiopathy events, development of antidrug antibodies, or new development of factor VIII inhibitors. Emicizumab prophylaxis administered subcutaneously once weekly or every 2 weeks led to a significantly lower bleeding rate than no prophylaxis among persons with hemophilia A without inhibitors; more than half the participants who received prophylaxis had no treated bleeding events. In an intraindividual comparison, emicizumab therapy led to a significantly lower bleeding rate than previous factor VIII prophylaxis. (Funded by F.

"Hepatic Arterial Infusion of Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin Versus Transarterial Chemoembolization for Large Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Randomized Phase III Trial. In a previous phase II trial, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) yielded higher treatment responses than transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in large unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare the overall survival of patients treated with FOLFOX-HAIC versus TACE as first-line treatment in this population. In this randomized, multicenter, open-label trial, adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (largest diameter ≥ 7 cm) without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread were randomly assigned 1:1 to FOLFOX-HAIC (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, leucovorin 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2,400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 24 hours, once every 3 weeks) or TACE (epirubicin 50 mg, lobaplatin 50 mg, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles). The primary end point was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received ≥ 1 cycle of study treatment. Between October 1, 2016, and November 23, 2018, 315 patients were randomly assigned to FOLFOX-HAIC (n = 159) or TACE (n = 156).

"Randomized Double-Blind Phase II Study of Maintenance Pembrolizumab Versus Placebo After First-Line Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer. Platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer is typically administered for a fixed duration followed by observation until progression. ""Switch maintenance"" therapy with PD-1 blockade at the time of chemotherapy cessation may be attractive for mechanistic and pragmatic reasons. Patients with metastatic urothelial cancer achieving at least stable disease on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned double-blind 1:1 to switch maintenance pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks versus placebo for up to 24 months. Patients with disease progression on placebo could cross over to pembrolizumab. The primary objective was to determine the progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included determining overall survival as well as treatment outcomes according to PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS). Between December 2015 and November 2018, 108 patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (n = 55) or placebo (n = 53). The objective response rate was 23% with pembrolizumab and 10% with placebo. Treatment-emergent grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 59% receiving pembrolizumab and 38% of patients receiving placebo. Progression-free survival was significantly longer with maintenance pembrolizumab versus placebo (5.4 months [95% CI, 3.1 to 7.3 months] <i>v</i> 3.0 months [95% CI; 2.7 to 5.5 months]; hazard ratio, 0.65; log-rank <i>P</i> = .04; maximum efficiency robust test <i>P</i> = .039).

"Rituximab maintenance improves survival in male patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Results of the HD2002 prospective multicentre randomized phase III trial. In the multicentre prospective randomized HD2002 trial, rituximab maintenance therapy (375 mg/m(2) every 3 months for 2 years) versus observation was evaluated for CD20(+) B-cell lymphoma. Out of 321 patients [161 randomized to the treatment group (TG), 160 to the observation group (OG)], 295 data sets were evaluable for statistical analysis. Estimated 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 81% in the TG and 70% in the OG (logrank test, P = 0·047). In the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subgroup (n = 152), 5-year RFS was excellent, at 87% in the TG and 84% in the OG (logrank test, P = 0·35). Of note, only in male patients of the DLBCL subgroup was RFS significantly superior in the TG in comparison to the OG (5-year RFS: 88% vs. 74%; logrank test, P = 0·05). Cox regression analysis showed a significant interaction between treatment and gender regarding overall survival (OS) (P = 0·006) and RFS (P = 0·02), with a lower hazard in females than males in the OG [OS: hazard ratio (HR) (female:male) = 0·11; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0·00-1·03; RFS: HR (female:male) = 0·27; 95% CI = 0·05-0·97], and no significant differences between males and females in the TG.

"Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Trial of Apatinib in Patients With Chemotherapy-Refractory Advanced or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach or Gastroesophageal Junction. There is currently no standard treatment strategy for patients with advanced metastatic gastric cancer experiencing progression after two or more lines of chemotherapy. We assessed the efficacy and safety of apatinib, a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma for whom at least two lines of prior chemotherapy had failed. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients from 32 centers in China with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, for whom two or more prior lines of chemotherapy had failed, were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to oral apatinib 850 mg or placebo once daily. The primary end points were overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Between January 2011 and November 2012, 267 patients were enrolled. Median OS was significantly improved in the apatinib group compared with the placebo group (6.5 months; 95% CI, 4.8 to 7.6 v 4.7 months; 95% CI, 3.6 to 5.4; P = .0149; hazard ratio, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.537 to 0.937; P = .0156).

"Caplacizumab Treatment for Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. In acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), an immune-mediated deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 allows unrestrained adhesion of von Willebrand factor multimers to platelets and microthrombosis, which result in thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and tissue ischemia. Caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor humanized, bivalent variable-domain-only immunoglobulin fragment, inhibits interaction between von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets. In this double-blind, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 145 patients with TTP to receive caplacizumab (10-mg intravenous loading bolus, followed by 10 mg daily subcutaneously) or placebo during plasma exchange and for 30 days thereafter. The primary outcome was the time to normalization of the platelet count, with discontinuation of daily plasma exchange within 5 days thereafter. Key secondary outcomes included a composite of TTP-related death, recurrence of TTP, or a thromboembolic event during the trial treatment period; recurrence of TTP at any time during the trial; refractory TTP; and normalization of organ-damage markers. The median time to normalization of the platelet count was shorter with caplacizumab than with placebo (2.69 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.89 to 2.83] vs. 2.88 days [95% CI, 2.68 to 3.56], P=0.01), and patients who received caplacizumab were 1.55 times as likely to have a normalization of the platelet count as those who received placebo. The percentage of patients with a composite outcome event was 74% lower with caplacizumab than with placebo (12% vs. 49%, P<0.001). The percentage of patients who had a recurrence of TTP at any time during the trial was 67% lower with caplacizumab than with placebo (12% vs. 38%, P<0.001). Refractory disease developed in no patients in the caplacizumab group and in three patients in the placebo group. Patients who received caplacizumab needed less plasma exchange and had a shorter hospitalization than those who received placebo. The most common adverse event was mucocutaneous bleeding, which was reported in 65% of the patients in the caplacizumab group and in 48% in the placebo group. During the trial treatment period, three patients in the placebo group died. One patient in the caplacizumab group died from cerebral ischemia after the end of the treatment period. Among patients with TTP, treatment with caplacizumab was associated with faster normalization of the platelet count; a lower incidence of a composite of TTP-related death, recurrence of TTP, or a thromboembolic event during the treatment period; and a lower rate of recurrence of TTP during the trial than placebo.

"Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of HLX02 Compared with Reference Trastuzumab in Patients with Recurrent or Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Equivalence Trial. HLX02 is an approved biosimilar of trastuzumab. This study aimed to evaluated the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of HLX02 compared with reference trastuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. This randomized, double-blind, phase III study was conducted at 89 centers in China, the Philippines, Poland, and Ukraine. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive HLX02 or European Union (EU)-sourced trastuzumab (initial dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 12 months) in combination with docetaxel intravenously. The primary endpoint was overall response rate up to week 24 (ORR<sub>24</sub>). Equivalence was declared if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference was within ± 13.5%. Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated in patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Between 11 November 2016 and 10 July 2019, a total of 649 patients were enrolled. The ORR<sub>24</sub> was 71.3 and 71.4% in the HLX02 (n = 324) and EU-trastuzumab (n = 325) groups, with a difference of - 0.1% (95% CI - 7 to 6.9), which fell entirely in the predefined equivalence margins. No statistically significant differences were observed in all secondary efficacy analyses. Safety profiles and immunogenicity were comparable in HLX02 and EU-trastuzumab groups. In total, 98.8% of patients in each group experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), 23.8 and 24.9% experienced serious TEAEs, and 0.6% in each group had antidrug antibodies.

"Adjuvant zoledronic acid and letrozole plus ovarian function suppression in premenopausal breast cancer: HOBOE phase 3 randomised trial. The aim of the study is to analyse whether letrozole (L) and zoledronic acid plus L (ZL) are more effective than tamoxifen (T) as adjuvant endocrine treatment of premenopausal patients with breast cancer with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumours. In a phase 3 trial, 1065 premenopausal patients with HR + early breast cancer received triptorelin to suppress ovarian function and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to adjuvant T, L or ZL for 5 years. Cancer recurrence, second breast or non-breast cancer and death were considered events for the intention-to-treat disease-free survival (DFS) analysis. With a 64-month median follow-up and 134 reported events, the disease-free rate at 5 years was 85.4%, 93.2% and 93.3% with T, L and ZL, respectively (overall P = 0.008). The hazard ratio for a DFS event was 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.80; P = 0.003) with ZL vs T, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.48 to 1.07; P = 0.06) with L vs T and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.12; P = 0.22) with ZL vs L. With 36 deaths, there was no significant difference in overall survival (P = 0.14).

"Sequential vs concurrent epirubicin and docetaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk, node-negative, early breast cancer: an interim analysis of a randomised phase III study from the Hellenic Oncology Research Group. Sequential anthracyclines and taxanes are standard adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk axillary node-positive breast cancer. We compared a sequential to a concurrent regimen in high-risk node-negative early breast cancer. Patients were eligible if they had tumours >2 cm or T1c with two of the following characteristics: no oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression, histological grade III, Ki67 >40% and vascular, lymphovascular or perineural invasion. They were randomised to receive four cycles of epirubicin 90 mg m<sup>-2</sup> followed by four cycles of docetaxel 75 mg m<sup>-2</sup> (sequential regimen) or six cycles of epirubicin 75 mg m<sup>-2</sup> plus docetaxel 75 mg m<sup>-2</sup> (concurrent regimen). All chemotherapy cycles were administered every 21 days with G-CSF prophylaxis only for the concurrent arm. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Between 2001 and 2013, 658 women received the sequential (n=329) or the concurrent (n=329) regimen. The median age was 53 years, 43.9% of the patients were premenopausal and of the tumours 44.2% were ⩽2 cm, 52.7% histological grade 3 and 35.3% hormone receptor-negative. After a median follow-up of 70.5 months, there were 29 (8.8%) vs 42 (12.8%) disease relapses (P=0.102) and 11 (3.3%) vs 19 (5.8%) deaths (P=0.135), in the sequential and concurrent arm, respectively. The 5-year DFS rates were 92.6% vs 88.2% for sequential and concurrent arm, respectively (hazard ratio (HR): 1.591; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.990-2.556; P=0.055). Toxicity included grade 2-4 neutropenia in 54% vs 41% (P=0.001), febrile neutropenia 2.7% vs 6.1% (P=0.06), nausea/vomiting 18.5% vs 12.4% (P=0.03) of patients in the sequential and concurrent arm. There were no toxic deaths. Sequential compared with the concurrent administration of anthracyclines and taxanes is associated with a non-significant but possibly clinically meaningful improvement in DFS.

"Docetaxel vs. vinorelbine in elderly patients with advanced non--small-cell lung cancer: a hellenic oncology research group randomized phase III study. This study compared front-line treatment with docetaxel or vinorelbine in elderly patients with advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Chemotherapy-naive patients with inoperable stage IIIB and stage IV NSCLC who were > 65 years of age with performance status (PS) of 0-2 were enrolled. Patients were assigned to receive either docetaxel 38 mg/m(2) or vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) by intravenous (I.V.) infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. One hundred thirty elderly patients were enrolled in the study (docetaxel n = 66 and vinorelbine n = 64 patients). The objective response rate was 12.1% and 14.1% in patients treated with docetaxel and vinorelbine, respectively (2P = .799). The median time to tumor progression (TTP) was 2.33 and 1.9 months (2P = .298) and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.07 and 3.87 months (2P = .090) in the docetaxel and vinorelbine arms, respectively. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 4.5% and 29.7% of patients in the docetaxel arm and vinorelbine arm, respectively (2P < .001).

"Cediranib plus FOLFOX/CAPOX versus placebo plus FOLFOX/CAPOX in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized, double-blind, phase III study (HORIZON II). Cediranib is a highly potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling with activity against all three VEGF receptors. HORIZON II [Cediranib (AZD2171, RECENTIN) in Addition to Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Patients With Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer] assessed infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin/capecitabine and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX/CAPOX) with or without cediranib in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Eligible patients were initially randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive cediranib (20 or 30 mg per day) or placebo plus FOLFOX/CAPOX. In an early analysis of this and two other cediranib studies (HORIZON I [Cediranib Plus FOLFOX6 Versus Bevacizumab Plus FOLFOX6 in Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer] and HORIZON III [Cediranib Plus FOLFOX6 Versus Bevacizumab Plus FOLFOX6 in Patients With Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer]), the 20-mg dose met the predefined criteria for continuation. Subsequent patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to the cediranib 20 mg or placebo arms. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were coprimary end points. In all, 860 patients received cediranib 20 mg (n = 502) or placebo (n = 358). The addition of cediranib to FOLFOX/CAPOX resulted in PFS prolongation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98; P = .0121; median PFS, 8.6 months for cediranib v 8.3 months for placebo) but had no impact on OS (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.12; P = .5707; median OS, 19.7 months for cediranib v 18.9 months for placebo). There were no significant differences in the secondary end points of objective response rate, duration of response, or liver resection rate. Median chemotherapy dose-intensity was decreased by approximately 10% in patients treated with cediranib. Adverse events (AEs) associated with cediranib were manageable. CONCLUSION Addition of cediranib 20 mg to FOLFOX/CAPOX resulted in a modest PFS prolongation, but no significant difference in OS. The cediranib AE profile was consistent with those from previous studies. Because of the lack of improvement in OS, cediranib plus an oxaliplatin-based regimen cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with mCRC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22965965/,22965965,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib compared to FOLFOX4 when used to treat Colorectal cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib versus FOLFOX4 in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib and FOLFOX4 for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib versus FOLFOX4 in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib when compared with FOLFOX4 for Colorectal cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib in comparison to FOLFOX4 for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib compared to FOLFOX4 for addressing Colorectal cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib and FOLFOX4 in the treatment of Colorectal cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib against FOLFOX4 for managing Colorectal cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib compared to FOLFOX4 in treating Colorectal cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib contrasted with FOLFOX4 in relation to Colorectal cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib versus FOLFOX4 for treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib and FOLFOX4 in treating Colorectal cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib as opposed to FOLFOX4 in managing Colorectal cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib compared to FOLFOX4 in the context of Colorectal cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib compares to FOLFOX4 in terms of effectiveness for Colorectal cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib in relation to FOLFOX4 for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib versus FOLFOX4 for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib's efficacy in comparison with FOLFOX4 in treating Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of CapeOx and Cediranib|FOLFOX4 and Cediranib|mFOLFOX6 and Cediranib against FOLFOX4 regarding Colorectal cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00399035,"{""22965965"": ""Paulo M Hoff|Andreas Hochhaus|Bernhard C Pestalozzi|Niall C Tebbutt|Jin Li|Tae Won Kim|Krassimir D Koynov|Galina Kurteva|Tamás Pintér|Ying Cheng|Brigitte van Eyll|Laura Pike|Anitra Fielding|Jane D Robertson|Mark P Saunders""}",2006-11,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"Rituximab improves the treatment results of DHAP-VIM-DHAP and ASCT in relapsed/progressive aggressive CD20+ NHL: a prospective randomized HOVON trial. We evaluated the role of rituximab during remission induction chemotherapy in relapsed aggressive CD20+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Of 239 patients, 225 were evaluable for analysis. Randomized to DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone)-VIM (etoposide-ifosfamide-methotrexate)-DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone) chemotherapy with rituximab (R; R-DHAP arm) were 119 patients (113 evaluable) and to chemotherapy without rituximab (DHAP arm) 120 patients (112 evaluable). Patients in complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) after 2 chemotherapy courses were eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation.

"Busulfan and melphalan versus carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan as high-dose chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL1/SIOPEN): an international, randomised, multi-arm, open-label, phase 3 trial. High-dose chemotherapy with haemopoietic stem-cell rescue improves event-free survival in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma; however, which regimen has the greatest patient benefit has not been established. We aimed to assess event-free survival after high-dose chemotherapy with busulfan and melphalan compared with carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan. We did an international, randomised, multi-arm, open-label, phase 3 cooperative group clinical trial of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma at 128 institutions in 18 countries that included an open-label randomised arm in which high-dose chemotherapy regimens were compared. Patients (age 1-20 years) with neuroblastoma were eligible to be randomly assigned if they had completed a multidrug induction regimen (cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and etoposide with or without topotecan, vincristine, and doxorubicin) and achieved an adequate disease response. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to busulfan and melphalan or to carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan by minimisation, balancing age at diagnosis, stage, MYCN amplification, and national cooperative clinical group between groups. The busulfan and melphalan regimen comprised oral busulfan (150 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given on 4 days consecutively in four equal doses); after Nov 8, 2007, intravenous busulfan was given (0·8-1·2 mg/kg per dose for 16 doses according to patient weight). After 24 h, an intravenous melphalan dose (140 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was given. Doses of busulfan and melphalan were modified according to bodyweight. The carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan regimen consisted of carboplatin continuous infusion of area under the plasma concentration-time curve 4·1 mg/mL per min per day for 4 days, etoposide continuous infusion of 338 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day for 4 days, and melphalan 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day for 3 days, with doses for all three drugs modified according to bodyweight and glomerular filtration rate. Stem-cell rescue was given after the last dose of high-dose chemotherapy, at least 24 h after melphalan in patients who received busulfan and melphalan and at least 72 h after carboplatin etoposide, and melphalan. All patients received subsequent local radiotherapy to the primary tumour site followed by maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704716, and EudraCT, number 2006-001489-17. Between June 24, 2002, and Oct 8, 2010, 1347 patients were enrolled and 676 were eligible for random allocation, 598 (88%) of whom were randomly assigned: 296 to busulfan and melphalan and 302 to carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan. Median follow-up was 7·2 years (IQR 5·3-9·2). At 3 years, 146 of 296 patients in the busulfan and melphalan group and 188 of 302 in the carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan group had an event; 3-year event-free survival was 50% (95% CI 45-56) versus 38% (32-43; p=0·0005). Nine patients in the busulfan and melphalan group and 11 in the carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan group had died without relapse by 5 years. Severe life-threatening toxicities occurred in 13 (4%) patients who received busulfan and melphalan and 29 (10%) who received carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events were general condition (74 [26%] of 281 in the busulfan and melphalan group vs 103 [38%] of 270 in the carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan group), infection (55 [19%] of 283 vs 74 [27%] of 271), and stomatitis (138 [49%] of 284 vs 162 [59%] of 273); 60 (22%) of 267 patients in the busulfan and melphalan group had Bearman grades 1-3 veno-occlusive disease versus 21 (9%) of 239 in the carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan group.

"Improved outcome in pediatric relapsed acute myeloid leukemia: results of a randomized trial on liposomal daunorubicin by the International BFM Study Group. In pediatric relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), optimal reinduction therapy is unknown. Studies suggest that liposomal daunorubicin (DNX; DaunoXome; Galen, Craigavon, United Kingdom) is effective and less cardiotoxic, which is important in this setting. These considerations led to a randomized phase III study by the International Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster Study Group. Patients with relapsed or primary refractory non-French-American-British type M3 AML who were younger than 21 years of age were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) or to FLAG plus DNX in the first reinduction course. The primary end point was status of the bone marrow (BM) sampled shortly before the second course of chemotherapy (the day 28 BM). Data are presented according to intention-to-treat for all 394 randomly assigned patients (median follow-up, 4.0 years). The complete remission (CR) rate was 64%, and the 4-year probability of survival (pOS) was 38% (SE, 3%). The day 28 BM status (available in 359 patients) was good (≤ 20% leukemic blasts) in 80% of patients randomly assigned to FLAG/DNX and 70% for patients randomly assigned to FLAG (P = .04). Concerning secondary end points, the CR rate was 69% with FLAG/DNX and 59% with FLAG (P = .07), but overall survival was similar. However, core-binding factor (CBF) AML treated with FLAG/DNX resulted in pOS of 82% versus 58% with FLAG (P = .04). Grade 3 to 4 toxicity was essentially similar in both groups. DNX added to FLAG improves early treatment response in pediatric relapsed AML. Overall long-term survival was similar, but CBF-AML showed an improved survival with FLAG/DNX.

"Adaptive Randomization of Neratinib in Early Breast Cancer. The heterogeneity of breast cancer makes identifying effective therapies challenging. The I-SPY 2 trial, a multicenter, adaptive phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant therapy for high-risk clinical stage II or III breast cancer, evaluated multiple new agents added to standard chemotherapy to assess the effects on rates of pathological complete response (i.e., absence of residual cancer in the breast or lymph nodes at the time of surgery). We used adaptive randomization to compare standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib with control. Eligible women were categorized according to eight biomarker subtypes on the basis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, hormone-receptor status, and risk according to a 70-gene profile. Neratinib was evaluated against control with regard to 10 biomarker signatures (prospectively defined combinations of subtypes). The primary end point was pathological complete response. Volume changes on serial magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess the likelihood of such a response in each patient. Adaptive assignment to experimental groups within each disease subtype was based on Bayesian probabilities of the superiority of the treatment over control. Enrollment in the experimental group was stopped when the 85% Bayesian predictive probability of success in a confirmatory phase 3 trial of neoadjuvant therapy reached a prespecified threshold for any biomarker signature (""graduation""). Enrollment was stopped for futility if the probability fell to below 10% for every biomarker signature. Neratinib reached the prespecified efficacy threshold with regard to the HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative signature. Among patients with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative cancer, the mean estimated rate of pathological complete response was 56% (95% Bayesian probability interval [PI], 37 to 73%) among 115 patients in the neratinib group, as compared with 33% among 78 controls (95% PI, 11 to 54%). The final predictive probability of success in phase 3 testing was 79%. Neratinib added to standard therapy was highly likely to result in higher rates of pathological complete response than standard chemotherapy with trastuzumab among patients with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer.

"High-dose melphalan versus melphalan plus dexamethasone for AL amyloidosis. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been reported to provide higher response rates and better overall survival than standard chemotherapy in immunoglobulin-light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, but these two strategies have not been compared in a randomized study. We conducted a randomized trial comparing high-dose intravenous melphalan followed by autologous hematopoietic stem-cell rescue with standard-dose melphalan plus high-dose dexamethasone in patients with AL amyloidosis. Patients (age range, 18 to 70 years) with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis were randomly assigned to receive intravenous high-dose melphalan plus autologous stem cells or oral melphalan plus oral high-dose dexamethasone. Fifty patients were enrolled in each group. The results were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, with overall survival as the primary end point. After a median follow-up of 3 years, the estimated median overall survival was 22.2 months in the group assigned to receive high-dose melphalan and 56.9 months in the group assigned to receive melphalan plus high-dose dexamethasone (P=0.04). Among patients with high-risk disease, overall survival was similar in the two groups. Among patients with low-risk disease, there was a nonsignificant difference between the two groups in overall survival at 3 years (58% in the group assigned to receive high-dose melphalan vs. 80% in the group assigned to receive melphalan plus high-dose dexamethasone; P=0.13). The outcome of treatment of AL amyloidosis with high-dose melphalan plus autologous stem-cell rescue was not superior to the outcome with standard-dose melphalan plus dexamethasone.

"Carboplatin and weekly paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy compared with monotherapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: IFCT-0501 randomised, phase 3 trial. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is recommended to treat advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in fit, non-elderly adults, but monotherapy is recommended for patients older than 70 years. We compared a carboplatin and paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy regimen with monotherapy in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. In this multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised trial we recruited patients aged 70-89 years with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and WHO performance status scores of 0-2. Patients received either four cycles (3 weeks on treatment, 1 week off treatment) of carboplatin (on day 1) plus paclitaxel (on days 1, 8, and 15) or five cycles (2 weeks on treatment, 1 week off treatment) of vinorelbine or gemcitabine monotherapy. Randomisation was done centrally with the minimisation method. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and analysis was done by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number NCT00298415. 451 patients were enrolled. 226 were randomly assigned monotherapy and 225 doublet chemotherapy. Median age was 77 years and median follow-up was 30.3 months (range 8.6-45.2). Median overall survival was 10.3 months for doublet chemotherapy and 6.2 months for monotherapy (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.78; p<0.0001); 1-year survival was 44.5% (95% CI 37.9-50.9) and 25.4% (19.9-31.3), respectively. Toxic effects were more frequent in the doublet chemotherapy group than in the monotherapy group (most frequent, decreased neutrophil count (108 [48.4%] vs 28 [12.4%]; asthenia 23 [10.3%] vs 13 [5.8%]).

"Randomized, phase III study of gemcitabine or erlotinib maintenance therapy versus observation, with predefined second-line treatment, after cisplatin-gemcitabine induction chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. This phase III study investigated whether continuation maintenance with gemcitabine or switch maintenance with erlotinib improves clinical outcome compared with observation in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease was controlled after cisplatin-gemcitabine induction chemotherapy. Four hundred sixty-four patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC without tumor progression after four cycles of cisplatin-gemcitabine were randomly assigned to observation or to gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle) or daily erlotinib (150 mg/day) study arms. On disease progression, patients in all three arms received pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2) once every 21 days) as predefined second-line therapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was significantly prolonged by gemcitabine (median, 3.8 v 1.9 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.72; log-rank P < .001) and erlotinib (median, 2.9 v 1.9 months; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88; log-rank P = .003) versus observation; this benefit was consistent across all clinical subgroups. Both maintenance strategies resulted in a nonsignificant improvement in overall survival (OS); patients who received second-line pemetrexed or with a performance status of 0 appeared to derive greater benefit. Exploratory analysis showed that magnitude of response to induction chemotherapy may affect the OS benefit as a result of gemcitabine maintenance. Maintenance gemcitabine and erlotinib were well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events. Gemcitabine continuation maintenance or erlotinib switch maintenance significantly reduces disease progression in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with cisplatin-gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy.

"Efficacy of melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide in patients older than 75 years with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: IFM 01/01 trial. Until recently, melphalan and prednisone were the standards of care in elderly patients with multiple myeloma. The addition of thalidomide to this combination demonstrated a survival benefit for patients age 65 to 75 years. This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial investigated the efficacy of melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide in patients older than 75 years with newly diagnosed myeloma. Between April 2002 and December 2006, 232 previously untreated patients with myeloma, age 75 years or older, were enrolled and 229 were randomly assigned to treatment. All patients received melphalan (0.2 mg/kg/d) plus prednisone (2 mg/kg/d) for 12 courses (day 1 to 4) every 6 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg/d of oral thalidomide (n = 113) or placebo (n = 116), continuously for 72 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. After a median follow-up of 47.5 months, overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide compared with those who received melphalan and prednisone plus placebo (median, 44.0 v 29.1 months; P = .028). Progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide group (median, 24.1 v 18.5 months; P = .001). Two adverse events were significantly increased in the melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide group: grade 2 to 4 peripheral neuropathy (20% v 5% in the melphalan and prednisone plus placebo group; P < .001) and grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (23% v 9%; P = .003). This trial confirms the superiority of the combination melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide over melphalan and prednisone alone for prolonging survival in very elderly patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.

"Lenalidomide maintenance after stem-cell transplantation for multiple myeloma. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation is a standard treatment for young patients with multiple myeloma. Residual disease is almost always present after transplantation and is responsible for relapse. This phase 3, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy of lenalidomide maintenance therapy after transplantation. We randomly assigned 614 patients younger than 65 years of age who had nonprogressive disease after first-line transplantation to maintenance treatment with either lenalidomide (10 mg per day for the first 3 months, increased to 15 mg if tolerated) or placebo until relapse. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Lenalidomide maintenance therapy improved median progression-free survival (41 months, vs. 23 months with placebo; hazard ratio, 0.50; P<0.001). This benefit was observed across all patient subgroups, including those based on the β(2)-microglobulin level, cytogenetic profile, and response after transplantation. With a median follow-up period of 45 months, more than 70% of patients in both groups were alive at 4 years. The rates of grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy were similar in the two groups. The incidence of second primary cancers was 3.1 per 100 patient-years in the lenalidomide group versus 1.2 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group (P=0.002). Median event-free survival (with events that included second primary cancers) was significantly improved with lenalidomide (40 months, vs. 23 months with placebo; P<0.001). Lenalidomide maintenance after transplantation significantly prolonged progression-free and event-free survival among patients with multiple myeloma. Four years after randomization, overall survival was similar in the two study groups.

"Bortezomib plus dexamethasone versus reduced-dose bortezomib, thalidomide plus dexamethasone as induction treatment before autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome conducted a randomized trial to compare bortezomib-dexamethasone (VD) as induction before high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) to a combination consisting of reduced doses of bortezomib and thalidomide plus dexamethasone (vtD) in patients with multiple myeloma. Overall, a total of 199 patients were centrally randomly assigned to receive VD or vtD. After 4 cycles, the complete response (CR) rate was the same in both groups (13% in the vtD arm, 12% in the VD arm, P = .74).

"Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone with Transplantation for Myeloma. High-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation has been the standard treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in adults up to 65 years of age. However, promising data on the use of combination therapy with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) in this population have raised questions about the role and timing of transplantation. We randomly assigned 700 patients with multiple myeloma to receive induction therapy with three cycles of RVD and then consolidation therapy with either five additional cycles of RVD (350 patients) or high-dose melphalan plus stem-cell transplantation followed by two additional cycles of RVD (350 patients). Patients in both groups received maintenance therapy with lenalidomide for 1 year. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group that underwent transplantation than in the group that received RVD alone (50 months vs. 36 months; adjusted hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.65; P<0.001). This benefit was observed across all patient subgroups, including those stratified according to International Staging System stage and cytogenetic risk. The percentage of patients with a complete response was higher in the transplantation group than in the RVD-alone group (59% vs. 48%, P=0.03), as was the percentage of patients in whom minimal residual disease was not detected (79% vs. 65%, P<0.001). Overall survival at 4 years did not differ significantly between the transplantation group and the RVD-alone group (81% and 82%, respectively). The rate of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the transplantation group than in the RVD-alone group (92% vs. 47%), as were the rates of grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal disorders (28% vs. 7%) and infections (20% vs. 9%). No significant between-group differences were observed in the rates of treatment-related deaths, second primary cancers, thromboembolic events, and peripheral neuropathy. Among adults with multiple myeloma, RVD therapy plus transplantation was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than RVD therapy alone, but overall survival did not differ significantly between the two approaches.

"VTD is superior to VCD prior to intensive therapy in multiple myeloma: results of the prospective IFM2013-04 trial. The Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome conducted a randomized trial to compare bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) with bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone (VCD) as induction before high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Overall, a total of 340 patients were centrally randomly assigned to receive VTD or VCD. After 4 cycles, on an intent-to-treat basis, 66.3% of the patients in the VTD arm achieved at least a very good partial response (primary end point) vs 56.2% in the VCD arm (P = .05). In addition, the overall response rate was significantly higher in the VTD arm (92.3% vs 83.4% in the VCD arm; P = .01). Hematologic toxicity was higher in the VCD arm, with significantly increased rates of grade 3 and 4 anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. On the other hand, the rate of peripheral neuropathy (PN) was significantly higher in the VTD arm.

"Melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide versus melphalan and prednisone alone or reduced-intensity autologous stem cell transplantation in elderly patients with multiple myeloma (IFM 99-06): a randomised trial. In multiple myeloma, combination chemotherapy with melphalan plus prednisone is still regarded as the standard of care in elderly patients. We assessed whether the addition of thalidomide to this combination, or reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation, would improve survival. Between May 22, 2000, and Aug 8, 2005, 447 previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma, who were aged between 65 and 75 years, were randomly assigned to receive either melphalan and prednisone (MP; n=196), melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide (MPT; n=125), or reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation using melphalan 100 mg/m2 (MEL100; n=126). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00367185. After a median follow-up of 51.5 months (IQR 34.4-63.2), median overall survival times were 33.2 months (13.8-54.8) for MP, 51.6 months (26.6-not reached) for MPT, and 38.3 months (13.0-61.6) for MEL100. The MPT regimen was associated with a significantly better overall survival than was the MP regimen (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.81, p=0.0006) or MEL100 regimen (0.69, 0.49-0.96, p=0.027). No difference was seen for MEL100 versus MP (0.86, 0.65-1.15, p=0.32). The results of our trial provide strong evidence to indicate that the use of thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone should, at present, be the reference treatment for previously untreated elderly patients with multiple myeloma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17920916/,17920916,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) compared to MPT when used to treat Multiple myeloma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) versus MPT in treating Multiple myeloma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) and MPT for managing Multiple myeloma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) versus MPT in treating Multiple myeloma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) when compared with MPT for Multiple myeloma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) in comparison to MPT for the treatment of Multiple myeloma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) compared to MPT for addressing Multiple myeloma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) and MPT in the treatment of Multiple myeloma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) against MPT for managing Multiple myeloma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) compared to MPT in treating Multiple myeloma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) contrasted with MPT in relation to Multiple myeloma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) versus MPT for treating Multiple myeloma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) and MPT in treating Multiple myeloma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) as opposed to MPT in managing Multiple myeloma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) compared to MPT in the context of Multiple myeloma.,What option most accurately summarizes how Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) compares to MPT in terms of effectiveness for Multiple myeloma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) in relation to MPT for the treatment of Multiple myeloma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) versus MPT for managing Multiple myeloma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP)'s efficacy in comparison with MPT in treating Multiple myeloma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP) against MPT regarding Multiple myeloma.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00367185,"{""17920916"": ""Thierry Facon|Jean Yves Mary|Cyrille Hulin|Lotfi Benboubker|Michel Attal|Brigitte Pegourie|Marc Renaud|Jean Luc Harousseau|Gaëlle Guillerm|Carine Chaleteix|Mamoun Dib|Laurent Voillat|Hervé Maisonneuve|Jacques Troncy|Véronique Dorvaux|Mathieu Monconduit|Claude Martin|Philippe Casassus|Jérôme Jaubert|Henry Jardel|Chantal Doyen|Brigitte Kolb|Bruno Anglaret|Bernard Grosbois|Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha|Claire Mathiot|Hervé Avet-Loiseau|Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome""}",2000-05,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Immunomodulatory Drugs
"Adoptive immunotherapy to lower postsurgical recurrence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomised trial. Postsurgical recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequent and fatal. Adoptive immunotherapy is active against HCC. We assessed whether postoperative immunotherapy could lower the frequency of recurrence. Between 1992 and 1995, we did a randomised trial in which 150 patients who had undergone curative resection for HCC were assigned adoptive immunotherapy (n=76) or no adjuvant treatment (n=74). Autologous lymphocytes activated vitro with recombinant interleukin-2 and antibody to CD3 were infused five times during the first 6 months. Primary endpoints were time to first recurrence and recurrence-free survival and analyses were by intention to treat. 76 patients received 370 (97%) of 380 scheduled lymphocyte infusions (mean cell number per patient 7.1x10(10) [SD 2.1]; CD3 and HLA-DR cells 78% [16]), and none had grade 3 or 4 adverse events. After a median follow-up of 4.4 years (range 0.2-6.7), adoptive immunotherapy decreased the frequency of recurrence by 18% compared with controls (45 [59%] vs 57 [77%]) [corrected] patients. Time to first recurrence in the immunotherapy group was significantly longer than that in the control group (48% [37-59] vs 33% [22-43] at 3 years, 38% [22-54] vs 22% [11-34] at 5 years; p=0.008). The immunotherapy group had significantly longer recurrence-free survival (p=0.01) and disease-specific survival (p=0.04) than the control group.

"Maintenance capecitabine and bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone after initial first-line bevacizumab and docetaxel for patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (IMELDA): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Longer duration of first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer is associated with prolonged overall survival and improved progression-free survival. We investigated capecitabine added to maintenance bevacizumab after initial treatment with bevacizumab and docetaxel in this setting. We did this open-label randomised phase 3 trial at 54 hospitals in Brazil, China, Egypt, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Turkey. We enrolled patients with HER2-negative measurable metastatic breast cancer; each received three to six cycles of first-line bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) and docetaxel (75-100 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks. Progression-free patients were randomly assigned with an interactive voice-response system by block (size four) randomisation (1:1) to receive either bevacizumab and capecitabine or bevacizumab only (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1; capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice per day on days 1-14, every 3 weeks) until progression, stratified by oestrogen receptor status (positive vs negative), visceral metastases (present vs absent), response status (stable disease vs response vs non-measurable), and lactate dehydrogenase concentration (≤1·5 vs >1·5 × upper limit of normal). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (from randomisation) in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00929240. Between July 16, 2009, and March 7, 2011 (when enrolment was prematurely terminated), 284 patients received initial bevacizumab and docetaxel; 185 (65%) were randomly assigned (91 to bevacizumab and capecitabine versus 94 to bevacizumab only). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the bevacizumab and capecitabine group than in the bevacizumab only group (median 11·9 months [95% CI 9·8-15·4] vs 4·3 months [3·9-6·8]; stratified hazard ratio 0·38 [95% CI 0·27-0·55]; two-sided log-rank p<0·0001), as was overall survival (median 39·0 months [95% CI 32·3-not reached] vs 23·7 months [18·5-31·7]; stratified HR 0·43 [95% CI 0·26-0·69]; two-sided log-rank p=0·0003). Results for time to progression were consistent with those for progression-free survival. 78 (86%) patients in the bevacizumab and capecitabine group and 72 (77%) in the bevacizumab only group had an objective response. Clinical benefit was recorded in 92 (98%) patients in the bevacizumab alone group and 90 (99%) in the bevacizumab and capecitabine group. Mean change from baseline in global health score did not differ significantly between groups. Grade 3 or worse adverse events during the maintenance phase were more common with bevacizumab and capecitabine than with bevacizumab only (45 [49%] of 91 patients vs 25 [27%] of 92 patients). The most common grade 3 or worse events were hand-foot syndrome (28 [31%] in the bevacizumab and capecitabine group vs none in the bevacizumab alone group), hypertension (eight [9%] vs three [3%]), and proteinuria (three [3%] vs four [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported by ten (11%) patients in the bevacizumab and capecitabine group and seven (8%) patients in the bevacizumab only group. Despite prematurely terminated accrual and the lack of information about post-progression treatment, both progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly improved with bevacizumab and capecitabine compared with bevacizumab alone as maintenance treatment. These results might inform future maintenance trials and current first-line treatment strategies for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

"Atezolizumab Plus Chemotherapy for First-Line Treatment of Nonsquamous NSCLC: Results From the Randomized Phase 3 IMpower132 Trial. We report the final results of the phase 3 IMpower132 study evaluating atezolizumab plus carboplatin or cisplatin plus pemetrexed (APP) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. Chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK genetic alterations were randomized in a one-to-one ratio to receive four or six cycles of carboplatin or cisplatin plus pemetrexed (PP) or APP every 3 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab plus pemetrexed or pemetrexed alone. Co-primary end points were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). The intention-to-treat population included 578 patients (APP, n = 292; PP, n = 286). At the primary PFS analysis (May 22, 2018; median follow-up, 14.8 mo), APP exhibited significant PFS improvement versus PP (median = 7.6 versus 5.2 mo, stratified hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.72, p < 0.0001). OS for the APP group was numerically better but not statistically significant at the interim (May 22, 2018; median = 18.1 versus 13.6 mo, stratified HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64-1.03, p = 0.0797) and final analyses (July 18, 2019; median = 17.5 versus 13.6 mo; stratified HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.71-1.06, p = 0.1546). The OS and PFS results favored APP versus PP across subgroups. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 54.6% (APP) and 40.1% (PP) of patients; grade 5 treatment-related events occurred in 3.8% and 2.9%, respectively.

In a multicenter phase III randomized trial, patients with advanced NSCLC, ECOG PS of 2, any histology at first and later amended to nonsquamous only, no prior chemotherapy, and adequate organ function were randomly assigned to P alone (500 mg/m(2)) or CP (area under the curve of 5 and 500 mg/m(2), respectively) administered every 3 weeks for a total of four cycles. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). A total of 205 eligible patients were enrolled from eight centers in Brazil and one in the United States from April 2008 to July 2011. The response rates were 10.3% for P and 23.8% for CP (P = .032). In the intent-to-treat population, the median PFS was 2.8 months for P and 5.8 months for CP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.63; P < .001), and the median OS was 5.3 months for P and 9.3 months for CP (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.83; P = .001).

"Gefitinib plus best supportive care in previously treated patients with refractory advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: results from a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer). This placebo-controlled phase III study investigated the effect on survival of gefitinib as second-line or third-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. 1692 patients who were refractory to or intolerant of their latest chemotherapy regimen were randomly assigned in a ratio of two to one either gefitinib (250 mg/day) or placebo, plus best supportive care. The primary endpoint was survival in the overall population of patients and those with adenocarcinoma. The primary analysis of the population for survival was by intention to treat. This study has been submitted for registration with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 1839IL/709. 1129 patients were assigned gefitinib and 563 placebo. At median follow-up of 7.2 months, median survival did not differ significantly between the groups in the overall population (5.6 months for gefitinib and 5.1 months for placebo; hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.77-1.02], p=0.087) or among the 812 patients with adenocarcinoma (6.3 months vs 5.4 months; 0.84 [0.68-1.03], p=0.089). Preplanned subgroup analyses showed significantly longer survival in the gefitinib group than the placebo group for never-smokers (n=375; 0.67 [0.49-0.92], p=0.012; median survival 8.9 vs 6.1 months) and patients of Asian origin (n=342; 0.66 [0.48-0.91], p=0.01; median survival 9.5 vs 5.5 months). Gefitinib was well tolerated, as in previous studies. Treatment with gefitinib was not associated with significant improvement in survival in either coprimary population.

"Randomized Phase III trial of gefitinib versus docetaxel in non-small cell lung cancer patients who have previously received platinum-based chemotherapy. The ISTANA (IRESSA as Second-line Therapy in Advanced NSCLC-KoreA) study compared gefitinib with docetaxel in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) pretreated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase III trial of gefitinib (250 mg/d) versus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) day 1 every 3 weeks) in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with one previous platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. A total of 161 patients (male, 62%; never smoker, 41%; adenocarcinoma, 68%) were enrolled. Progression-free survival was longer for gefitinib compared with docetaxel (hazard ratio, 0.729; 90% confidence interval, 0.533-0.998; one-sided P = 0.0441). Gefitinib significantly improved objective response rate (28.1% versus 7.6%; two-sided P = 0.0007). In the final analysis of overall survival, the hazard ratio was 0.870 (95% confidence interval, 0.613-1.236; two-sided P = 0.4370). No significant differences were seen in the quality of life or symptom improvement rates between the two treatment groups. Gefitinib was well tolerated, was consistent with previous data and disease, and had fewer serious adverse events and fewer Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or 4 adverse events than docetaxel. The incidence of interstitial lung disease-type events was 3.7% (n = 3) with gefitinib and 3.9% (n = 3) with docetaxel. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival was longer with gefitinib than docetaxel, and the secondary endpoints showed superior objective response rate, good tolerability, and similar quality of life improvement rates for gefitinib than docetaxel.

"High-dose dexamethasone vs prednisone for treatment of adult immune thrombocytopenia: a prospective multicenter randomized trial. This study compared the efficacy and safety of high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM) and conventional prednisone (PDN) on the largest cohort to date as first-line strategies for newly diagnosed adult primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Patients enrolled were randomized to receive DXM 40 mg/d for 4 days (n = 95, nonresponders received an additional 4-day course of DXM) or prednisone 1.0 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks and then tapered (n = 97). One or 2 courses of HD-DXM resulted in a higher incidence of overall initial response (82.1% vs 67.4%, P = .044) and complete response (50.5% vs 26.8%, P = .001) compared with prednisone. Time to response was shorter in the HD-DXM arm (P < .001), and a baseline bleeding score ≥8 was associated with a decreased likelihood of initial response. Sustained response was achieved by 40.0% of patients in the HD-DXM arm and 41.2% in the PDN arm (P = .884). Initial complete response was a positive indicator of sustained response, whereas presence of antiplatelet autoantibodies was a negative indicator. HD-DXM was generally tolerated better. We concluded that HD-DXM could be a preferred corticosteroid strategy for first-line management of adult primary ITP.

"Rituximab for High-Risk, Mature B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Children. Rituximab added to chemotherapy prolongs survival among adults with B-cell cancer. Data on its efficacy and safety in children with high-grade, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are limited. We conducted an open-label, international, randomized, phase 3 trial involving patients younger than 18 years of age with high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage III with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level or stage IV) or acute leukemia to compare the addition of six doses of rituximab to standard lymphomes malins B (LMB) chemotherapy with standard LMB chemotherapy alone. The primary end point was event-free survival. Overall survival and toxic effects were also assessed. Analyses were based on 328 patients who underwent randomization (164 patients per group); 85.7% of the patients had Burkitt's lymphoma. The median follow-up was 39.9 months. Events were observed in 10 patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and in 28 in the chemotherapy group. Event-free survival at 3 years was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1 to 96.7) in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 82.3% (95% CI, 75.7 to 87.5) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for primary refractory disease or first occurrence of progression, relapse after response, death from any cause, or second cancer, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66; one-sided P = 0.00096, which reached the significance level required for this analysis). Eight patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group died (4 deaths were disease-related, 3 were treatment-related, and 1 was from a second cancer), as did 20 in the chemotherapy group (17 deaths were disease-related, and 3 were treatment-related) (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.82). The incidence of acute adverse events of grade 4 or higher after prephase treatment was 33.3% in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 24.2% in the chemotherapy group (P = 0.07); events were related mainly to febrile neutropenia and infection. Approximately twice as many patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group as in the chemotherapy group had a low IgG level 1 year after trial inclusion. Rituximab added to standard LMB chemotherapy markedly prolonged event-free survival and overall survival among children and adolescents with high-grade, high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and was associated with a higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and, potentially, more episodes of infection.

"VCAP-AMP-VECP compared with biweekly CHOP for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma: Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study JCOG9801. Our previous phase II trial for treating human T-lymphotropic virus type I-associated adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VCAP), doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone (AMP), and vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone (VECP) showed promising results. To test the superiority of VCAP-AMP-VECP over biweekly cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), we conducted a randomized controlled trial exclusively for ATLL. Previously untreated patients with aggressive ATLL were assigned to receive either six courses of VCAP-AMP-VECP every 4 weeks or eight courses of biweekly CHOP. Both treatments were supported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and intrathecal prophylaxis. A total of 118 patients were enrolled. The complete response (CR) rate was higher in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm than in biweekly CHOP arm (40% v 25%, respectively; P = .020). Progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 28% in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm compared with 16% in the CHOP arm (P = .100, two-sided P = .200). Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 24% in the VCAP-AMP-VECP arm and 13% in the CHOP arm (P = .085, two-sided P = .169).

"Randomised phase III trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with oral uracil and tegafur plus leucovorin versus intravenous fluorouracil and levofolinate in patients with stage III colorectal cancer who have undergone Japanese D2/D3 lymph node dissection: final results of JCOG0205. NSABP C-06 demonstrated the non-inferiority of oral adjuvant uracil and tegafur plus leucovorin (UFT/LV) to weekly fluorouracil and folinate (5-FU/LV) with respect to disease-free survival (DFS) for stage II/III colon cancer. This is the first report of JCOG0205, which compared UFT/LV to standard 5-FU/levofolinate (l-LV) for stage III colorectal cancer patients who have undergone Japanese D2/D3 lymph node dissection. Patients were randomised to three courses of 5-FU/l-LV (5-FU 500 mg/m(2), l-LV 250 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 every 8 weeks) or five courses of UFT/LV (UFT 300 mg m(-2)day(-1), LV 75 mg/day on days 1-28 every 5 weeks). The primary end-point was DFS. The sample size was 1100 determined with one-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 0.78 and non-inferiority margin of hazard ratio of 1.27. This trial is registered with UMIN-CTR (C000000193). Between February 2003 and November 2006, 1,101 patients (1092 eligible patients) were randomised to 5-FU/l-LV (n=550) or UFT/LV (n=551). Median age: 61 years, colon/rectum: 67%/33%, number of positive nodes ⩽3/>3: 73%/27%, stage IIIa/IIIb: 75%/25%. The hazard ratio of DFS was 1.02 (91.3% confidence interval, 0.84-1.23), demonstrating the non-inferiority of UFT/LV (P=0.0236). Five-year overall survival (87.5%) was higher than that in NSABP C-06 (69.6%). Grade 3/4 toxicities were 8.4% neutropenia in 5-FU/l-LV and 8.7% alanine aminotransferase elevation in UFT/LV, respectively. The incidences of diarrhoea (9.6% versus 8.5%) and anorexia (4.0% versus 3.7%) were similar between the two arms. No treatment-related deaths were reported.

"Thoracic radiotherapy with or without daily low-dose carboplatin in elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301). It is unknown whether combined chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival in elderly patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to assess whether radiotherapy plus carboplatin results in longer survival than radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with NSCLC. This was a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301). Patients older than 70 years with unresectable stage III NSCLC were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy plus concurrent low-dose carboplatin [30 mg/m(2) per day, 5 days a week for 20 days]) or radiotherapy alone, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), stage (IIIA vs IIIB), and institution. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was analysed for the eligible population and stratified by ECOG performance status, stage, and institution. The trial was stopped early as a result of the second planned interim analysis. This study is registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000060, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00132665. 200 patients were enrolled from Sept 1, 2003 to May 27, 2010: 100 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 100 in the radiotherapy group. The second planned interim analysis was done 10 months after completion of patient accrual. At this time, median follow-up for censored cases was 19·4 months (IQR 10·3-33·5). In accordance with the prespecified stopping rule, the JCOG data and safety monitoring committee recommended early publication of this trial because the difference in overall survival favoured the chemoradiotherapy group. Median overall survival for the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone groups were 22·4 months (95% CI 16·5-33·6) and 16·9 months (13·4-20·3), respectively (hazard ratio 0·68, 95·4% CI 0·47-0·98, stratified log-rank test one-sided p value=0·0179). More patients had grade 3-4 haematological toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy alone group, including leucopenia (61 [63·5%] vs none), neutropenia (55 [57·3%] vs none), and thrombocytopenia (28 [29·2%] vs two [2·0%]). Grade 3 infection was more common with chemoradiotherapy (12 patients [12·5%]) than with radiotherapy (four patients [4·1%]). Incidences of grade 3-4 pneumonitis and late lung toxicity were similar between groups. There were seven treatment-related deaths: three of 100 patients (3·0%) in the chemoradiotherapy group and four of 100 (4·0%) in the radiotherapy group. For a select group of elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC, combination chemoradiotherapy provides a clinically significant benefit over radiotherapy alone, and should be considered for this population.

"Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin Versus Paclitaxel Plus Cisplatin in Metastatic or Recurrent Cervical Cancer: The Open-Label Randomized Phase III Trial JCOG0505. In metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is standard. The JCOG0505 randomized phase III trial evaluated the clinical benefits of carboplatin-based regimen. Eligible patients had metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer and had ≤ one platinum-containing treatment and no prior taxane. Patients were randomly assigned either to conventional paclitaxel plus cisplatin (TP; paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2) over 24 hours on day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) on day 2, repeated every 3 weeks) or paclitaxel plus carboplatin (TC; paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) over 3 hours and carboplatin area under curve 5 mg/mL/min on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks). Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Planned sample size was 250 patients to confirm the noninferiority of TC versus TP with the threshold hazard ratio (HR) of 1.29. Between February 2006 and November 2009, 253 patients were enrolled. The HR of OS was 0.994 (90% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; noninferiority P = .032 by stratified Cox regression). Median OS was 18.3 months with TP versus 17.5 months with TC. Among patients who had not received prior cisplatin, OS was shorter with TC (13.0 v 23.2 months; HR, 1.571; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.32). One treatment-related death occurred with TC. Proportion of nonhospitalization periods was significantly longer with TC (P < .001).

"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of tivantinib in Japanese patients with MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma. A previous randomized phase 2 study of hepatocellular carcinoma revealed that the c-Met inhibitor tivantinib as second-line treatment significantly prolonged progression-free survival in a subpopulation whose tumor samples highly expressed c-Met (MET-high). Accordingly, this phase 3 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tivantinib as a second-line treatment for Japanese patients with MET-high hepatocellular carcinoma. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 60 centers in Japan. Hepatocellular carcinoma patients with one prior sorafenib treatment and those with MET-high tumor samples were eligible for inclusion. Registered patients were randomly assigned to either the tivantinib or placebo group at a 2:1 ratio and were treated with twice-a-day oral tivantinib (120 mg bid) or placebo until the discontinuation criteria were met. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival while the secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety. Between January 2014 and June 2016, 386 patients provided consent, and 195 patients were randomized to the tivantinib (n = 134) or placebo (n = 61) group. Median progression-free survival was 2.8 (95% confidence interval: 2.7-2.9) and 2.3 (1.5-2.8) mo in the tivantinib and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.52-1.04, P = .082). Median overall survival was 10.3 (95% confidence interval: 8.1-11.6) and 8.5 (6.2-11.4) mo in the tivantinib and placebo group, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.82, 95% confidence interval: 0.58-1.15). The most common tivantinib-related grade ≥3 adverse events were neutropenia (31.6%), leukocytopenia (24.8%), and anemia (12.0%).

"Phase III trial of pemetrexed plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care in previously treated patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma. This multicenter, phase III study compared overall survival (OS) of second-line pemetrexed plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Secondary end points included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTF), and toxicity. Patients with relapsed MPM after first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus BSC (P+BSC) every 21 days or BSC alone. The study enrolled 243 patients (123 on P+BSC arm and 120 on BSC arm). Median OS time was not significantly different between the arms (8.4 months for P+BSC and 9.7 months for BSC; P = .74). Cox regression modeling suggested a trending survival benefit for patients who responded to first-line therapy. Time-to-event measures significantly favored P+BSC (median PFS, TTP, and TTF). Partial response was achieved in 18.7% and 1.7% of patients in P+BSC and BSC arms, respectively (P < .0001), and a disease control rate (partial response plus stable disease) was achieved in 59.3% and 19.2% of patients in P+BSC and BSC arms, respectively (P < .0001). Use of postdiscontinuation chemotherapy was significantly greater among BSC patients compared with P+BSC patients (51.7% v 28.5%, respectively; P = .0002), with more BSC patients receiving pemetrexed (18.3% v 3.3%, respectively; P = .0001). Postdiscontinuation therapy was initiated earlier for BSC than P+BSC patients (median time to initiation, 4.3 v 15.7 months, respectively; log-rank P < .0001). Chemotherapy was well tolerated, with expected modest (4% to 7%) grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities.

Chemotherapy-naive patients with ES-SCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of zero to 2 were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed-carboplatin (pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1; carboplatin at area under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC] 5 on day 1) or etoposide-carboplatin (etoposide 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3; carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. The primary objective of the study was noninferiority of pemetrexed-carboplatin overall survival with a 15% margin. Accrual was terminated with 908 of 1,820 patients enrolled after results of a planned interim analysis. In the final analysis, pemetrexed-carboplatin was inferior to etoposide-carboplatin for overall survival (median, 8.1 v 10.6 months; hazard ratio [HR],1.56; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.92; log-rank P < .01) and progression-free survival (median, 3.8 v 5.4 months; HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.17; log-rank P < .01). Objective response rates were also significantly lower for pemetrexed-carboplatin (31% v 52%; P < .001). Pemetrexed-carboplatin had lower grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and leukopenia than etoposide-carboplatin; grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia was comparable between arms and anemia was higher in the pemetrexed-carboplatin arm. Pemetrexed-carboplatin is inferior for the treatment of ES-SCLC. Planned translational research and pharmacogenomic analyses of tumor and blood samples may help explain the study results and provide insight into new treatment strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19720897/,19720897,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) compared to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed when used to treat Small cell lung cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) versus Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) and Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) versus Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) when compared with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for Small cell lung cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) in comparison to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) compared to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for addressing Small cell lung cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) and Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in the treatment of Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) against Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for managing Small cell lung cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) compared to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in treating Small cell lung cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) contrasted with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in relation to Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) versus Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) and Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in treating Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) as opposed to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in managing Small cell lung cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) compared to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in the context of Small cell lung cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) compares to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in terms of effectiveness for Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) in relation to Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) versus Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE)'s efficacy in comparison with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Carboplatin and Etoposide (CE) against Carboplatin and Pemetrexed regarding Small cell lung cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00363415,"{""19720897"": ""Mark A Socinski|Egbert F Smit|Paul Lorigan|Kartik Konduri|Martin Reck|Aleksandra Szczesna|Johnetta Blakely|Piotr Serwatowski|Nina A Karaseva|Tudor Ciuleanu|Jacek Jassem|Mircea Dediu|Shengyan Hong|Carla Visseren-Grul|Axel-Rainer Hanauske|Coleman K Obasaju|Susan C Guba|Nick Thatcher""}",2006-08,Yes,Yes,Intravenous,Antimetabolites|Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"Randomized Phase II Trial of Gefitinib With and Without Pemetrexed as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer With Activating Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations. To determine whether the addition of pemetrexed to gefitinib (P+G) provides clinical benefit, compared with gefitinib monotherapy, in patients with advanced nonsquamous (NS) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Chemotherapy-naïve for advanced NSCLC patients from China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan (35 sites) with advanced, EGFR-mutant, NS NSCLC were randomly assigned (2:1; computer-generated, interactive voice response) to open-label pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of every 21-day cycle) plus gefitinib (250 mg/d [n = 129]) or gefitinib alone (n = 66). The primary end point was progression-free-survival (PFS); secondary end points were time to progressive disease, overall survival, tumor response rates, duration of response, and safety. All end points were assessed in the intent-to-treat and safety population (P+G, n = 126; gefitinib alone, n = 65). PFS was significantly longer with P+G (median, 15.8 months; 95% CI, 12.6 to 18.3 months) than with gefitinib (median, 10.9 months; 95% CI, 9.7 to 13.8 months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.96; one-sided P = .014; two-sided P = .029). Results of EGFR exon 19 deletion and EGFR exon 21 L858R point mutation subgroup analyses were consistent with the intent-to-treat result. P+G, compared with gefitinib alone, resulted in significantly longer time to progressive disease (median, 16.2 v 10.9 months, respectively; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.93) and numerically longer duration of response (median, 15.4 v 11.3 months, respectively; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.08). Tumor response rates did not differ. Overall survival data are immature. Drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more common with P+G, but toxicities were manageable. P+G improved PFS compared with gefitinib alone in East Asian patients with advanced NS NSCLC and activating EGFR mutations.

"Oncological Benefits of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation With Gemcitabine Versus Upfront Surgery in Patients With Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: A Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Multicenter Phase 2/3 Trial. This study was performed to determine whether neoadjuvant treatment increases survival in patients with BRPC. Despite many promising retrospective data on the effect of neoadjuvant treatment for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC), no high-level evidence exists to support the role of such treatment. This phase 2/3 multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed to enroll 110 patients with BRPC who were randomly assigned to gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (54 Gray external beam radiation) followed by surgery or upfront surgery followed by chemoradiation treatment from four large-volume centers in Korea. The primary endpoint was the 2-year survival rate (2-YSR). Interim analysis was planned at the time of 50% case enrollment. After excluding the patients who withdrew consent (n = 8) from the 58 enrolled patients, 27 patients were allocated to neoadjuvant treatment and 23 to upfront surgery groups. The overall 2-YSR was 34.0% with a median survival of 16 months. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 2-YSR and median survival were significantly better in the neoadjuvant chemoradiation than the upfront surgery group [40.7%, 21 months vs 26.1%, 12 months, hazard ratio 1.495 (95% confidence interval 0.66-3.36), P = 0.028]. R0 resection rate was also significantly higher in the neoadjuvant chemoradiation group than upfront surgery (n = 14, 51.8% vs n = 6, 26.1%, P = 0.004). The safety monitoring committee decided on early termination of the study on the basis of the statistical significance of neoadjuvant treatment efficacy.

Gefitinib was compared with pemetrexed as second-line therapy in a clinically selected population previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. A phase 3 trial of gefitinib (250 mg/day) versus pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2) on day 1, every 3 weeks) was conducted in patients who had never smoked and who had advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma treated with 1 previous platinum-based regimen.

"Carboplatin and pemetrexed with or without pembrolizumab for advanced, non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomised, phase 2 cohort of the open-label KEYNOTE-021 study. Limited evidence exists to show that adding a third agent to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in the first-line advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting. The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has shown efficacy as monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and has a non-overlapping toxicity profile with chemotherapy. We assessed whether the addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 cohort of a multicohort study (KEYNOTE-021), patients were enrolled at 26 medical centres in the USA and Taiwan. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four stratified by PD-L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs ≥1%) using an interactive voice-response system to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg plus carboplatin area under curve 5 mg/mL per min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks followed by pembrolizumab for 24 months and indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy or to 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed alone followed by indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response, defined as the percentage of patients with radiologically confirmed complete or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 assessed by masked, independent central review, in the intention-to-treat population, defined as all patients who were allocated to study treatment. Significance threshold was p<0·025 (one sided). Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned study treatment. This trial, which is closed for enrolment but continuing for follow-up, is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02039674. Between Nov 25, 2014, and Jan 25, 2016, 123 patients were enrolled; 60 were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 63 to the chemotherapy alone group. 33 (55%; 95% CI 42-68) of 60 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achieved an objective response compared with 18 (29%; 18-41) of 63 patients in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI 9-42%]; p=0·0016). The incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events was similar between groups (23 [39%] of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 16 [26%] of 62 in the chemotherapy alone group). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were anaemia (seven [12%] of 59) and decreased neutrophil count (three [5%]); an additional six events each occurred in two (3%) for acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, and sepsis, and thrombocytopenia. In the chemotherapy alone group, the most common grade 3 or worse events were anaemia (nine [15%] of 62) and decreased neutrophil count, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia (two [3%] each). One (2%) of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group experienced treatment-related death because of sepsis compared with two (3%) of 62 patients in the chemotherapy group: one because of sepsis and one because of pancytopenia.

"Randomized clinical trial of pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy for previously untreated Chinese patients with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: KEYNOTE-042 China Study. In the global KEYNOTE-042 study (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02220894), pembrolizumab significantly improved overall survival (OS) vs chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive locally advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR/ALK alterations. We present results from patients in KEYNOTE-042 enrolled from China in the global or extension study (NCT03850444; protocol identical to global study). Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by ECOG performance status 0 vs 1, squamous vs nonsquamous histology and PD-L1 tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50% vs 1%-49%) to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or investigator's choice of 4 to 6 cycles of carboplatin plus paclitaxel or pemetrexed Q3W with optional pemetrexed maintenance for nonsquamous tumors.

"Pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel for previously treated advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer (KEYNOTE-063): A randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in Asian patients. KEYNOTE-063 (NCT03019588) investigated pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel as second-line therapy in Asian patients with advanced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive (combined positive score ≥1) gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. This randomized, open-label, phase 3 study was conducted at 36 medical centers in China (mainland), Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to 200 mg of pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for ≤2 years or 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of paclitaxel intravenously every week. Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and safety. Between February 16, 2017, and March 12, 2018, 94 patients were randomly assigned (47 pembrolizumab/47 paclitaxel) after screening; enrollment was stopped on March 12, 2018, based on the results of the global KEYNOTE-061 study, and patients were followed until the last patient's last visit. Median OS was 8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4-10 months) with pembrolizumab versus 8 months (95% CI, 5-11 months) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.63-1.54). Median PFS was 2 months (95% CI, 1-3 months) with pembrolizumab versus 4 months (95% CI, 3-6 months) with paclitaxel (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.04-2.52). ORR was 13% for pembrolizumab versus 19% for paclitaxel. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred in 28 pembrolizumab-treated patients (60%) and 42 paclitaxel-treated patients (96%); grades 3 to 5 events occurred in 5 patients (11%) and 28 patients (64%), respectively. Definitive conclusions about the efficacy of second-line pembrolizumab in Asian patients with advanced PD-L1-positive gastric/GEJ cancer are limited because of insufficient power, but pembrolizumab was well tolerated in this patient population.

"Pembrolizumab alone or combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma (KEYNOTE-361): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are active in metastatic urothelial carcinoma, but positive randomised data supporting their use as a first-line treatment are lacking. In this study we assessed outcomes with first-line pembrolizumab alone or combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy for patients with previously untreated advanced urothelial carcinoma. KEYNOTE-361 is a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial of patients aged at least 18 years, with untreated, locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of up to 2. Eligible patients were enrolled from 201 medical centres in 21 countries and randomly allocated (1:1:1) via an interactive voice-web response system to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for a maximum of 35 cycles plus intravenous chemotherapy (gemcitabine [1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>] on days 1 and 8 and investigator's choice of cisplatin [70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>] or carboplatin [area under the curve 5] on day 1 of every 3-week cycle) for a maximum of six cycles, pembrolizumab alone, or chemotherapy alone, stratified by choice of platinum therapy and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to the treatment assignment or CPS. At protocol-specified final analysis, sequential hypothesis testing began with superiority of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in the total population (all patients randomly allocated to a treatment) for the dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (p value boundary 0·0019), assessed by masked, independent central review, and overall survival (p value boundary 0·0142), followed by non-inferiority and superiority of overall survival for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in the patient population with CPS of at least 10 and in the total population (also a primary endpoint). Safety was assessed in the as-treated population (all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). This study is completed and is no longer enrolling patients, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02853305. Between Oct 19, 2016 and June 29, 2018, 1010 patients were enrolled and allocated to receive pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=351), pembrolizumab monotherapy (n=307), or chemotherapy alone (n=352). Median follow-up was 31·7 months (IQR 27·7-36·0). Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy did not significantly improve progression-free survival, with a median progression-free survival of 8·3 months (95% CI 7·5-8·5) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 7·1 months (6·4-7·9) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·78, 95% CI 0·65-0·93; p=0·0033), or overall survival, with a median overall survival of 17·0 months (14·5-19·5) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 14·3 months (12·3-16·7) in the chemotherapy group (0·86, 0·72-1·02; p=0·0407). No further formal statistical hypothesis testing was done. In analyses of overall survival with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy (now exploratory based on hierarchical statistical testing), overall survival was similar between these treatment groups, both in the total population (15·6 months [95% CI 12·1-17·9] with pembrolizumab vs 14·3 months [12·3-16·7] with chemotherapy; HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·77-1·11) and the population with CPS of at least 10 (16·1 months [13·6-19·9] with pembrolizumab vs 15·2 months [11·6-23·3] with chemotherapy; 1·01, 0·77-1·32). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event attributed to study treatment was anaemia with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (104 [30%] of 349 patients) or chemotherapy alone (112 [33%] of 342 patients), and diarrhoea, fatigue, and hyponatraemia (each affecting four [1%] of 302 patients) with pembrolizumab alone. Six (1%) of 1010 patients died due to an adverse event attributed to study treatment; two patients in each treatment group. One each occurred due to cardiac arrest and device-related sepsis in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, one each due to cardiac failure and malignant neoplasm progression in the pembrolizumab group, and one each due to myocardial infarction and ischaemic colitis in the chemotherapy group. The addition of pembrolizumab to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy did not significantly improve efficacy and should not be widely adopted for treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma.

Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved survival outcomes versus placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 study. We present the results of Chinese patients enrolled in the KEYNOTE-407 global and China extension studies. Patients enrolled from mainland China in the KEYNOTE-407 global (NCT02775435) and China extension studies (NCT03875092) were randomized 1:1 to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo plus four cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. Dual primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by blinded independent central review). A total of 125 patients were randomized (pembrolizumab-chemotherapy, n = 65; placebo-chemotherapy, n = 60). As of September 30, 2020, median (range) study follow-up was 28.1 (25.1‒40.9) months.

"Pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus placebo plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (KEYNOTE-412): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial. Despite multimodal therapy, 5-year overall survival for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is about 50%. We assessed the addition of pembrolizumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced HNSCC. In the randomised, double-blind, phase 3 KEYNOTE-412 trial, participants with newly diagnosed, high-risk, unresected locally advanced HNSCC from 130 medical centres globally were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab (200 mg) plus chemoradiotherapy or placebo plus chemoradiotherapy. Randomisation was done using an interactive response technology system and was stratified by investigator's choice of radiotherapy regimen, tumour site and p16 status, and disease stage, with participants randomly assigned in blocks of four per stratum. Participants, investigators, and sponsor personnel were masked to treatment assignments. Local pharmacists were aware of assignments to support treatment preparation. Pembrolizumab and placebo were administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 17 doses (one before chemoradiotherapy, two during chemoradiotherapy, 14 as maintenance therapy). Chemoradiotherapy included cisplatin (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) administered intravenously once every 3 weeks for two or three doses and accelerated or standard fractionation radiotherapy (70 Gy delivered in 35 fractions). The primary endpoint was event-free survival analysed in all randomly assigned participants. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03040999, and is active but not recruiting. Between April 19, 2017, and May 2, 2019, 804 participants were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab group (n=402) or the placebo group (n=402). 660 (82%) of 804 participants were male, 144 (18%) were female, and 622 (77%) were White. Median study follow-up was 47·7 months (IQR 42·1-52·3). Median event-free survival was not reached (95% CI 44·7 months-not reached) in the pembrolizumab group and 46·6 months (27·5-not reached) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·83 [95% CI 0·68-1·03]; log-rank p=0·043 [significance threshold, p≤0·024]). 367 (92%) of 398 participants treated in the pembrolizumab group and 352 (88%) of 398 participants treated in the placebo group had grade 3 or worse adverse events. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (108 [27%] of 398 participants in the pembrolizumab group vs 100 [25%] of 398 participants in the placebo group), stomatitis (80 [20%] vs 69 [17%]), anaemia (80 [20%] vs 61 [15%]), dysphagia (76 [19%] vs 62 [16%]), and decreased lymphocyte count (76 [19%] vs 81 [20%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 245 (62%) participants in the pembrolizumab group versus 197 (49%) participants in the placebo group, most commonly pneumonia (43 [11%] vs 25 [6%]), acute kidney injury (33 [8%] vs 30 [8%]), and febrile neutropenia (24 [6%] vs seven [2%]). Treatment-related adverse events led to death in four (1%) participants in the pembrolizumab group (one participant each from aspiration pneumonia, end-stage renal disease, pneumonia, and sclerosing cholangitis) and six (2%) participants in the placebo group (three participants from pharyngeal haemorrhage and one participant each from mouth haemorrhage, post-procedural haemorrhage, and sepsis). Pembrolizumab plus chemoradiotherapy did not significantly improve event-free survival compared with chemoradiotherapy alone in a molecularly unselected, locally advanced HNSCC population. No new safety signals were seen. Locally advanced HNSCC remains a challenging disease that requires better treatment approaches.

"Neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal cancer (KEYNOTE-585): an interim analysis of the multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 study. The benefit of combination neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition in patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma is unknown. We assess the antitumor activity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The KEYNOTE-585 study is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study done at 143 medical centres in 24 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with untreated, locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive voice response system and integrated web response system to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously or placebo (saline) plus cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy (main cohort) every 3 weeks for 3 cycles, followed by surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo plus chemotherapy for 3 cycles, then adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles. A small cohort was also randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab or placebo plus fluorouracil, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin (FLOT)-based chemotherapy (FLOT cohort) every 2 weeks for four cycles, followed by surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab, or placebo plus FLOT for four cycles, then adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles. Patients were stratified by geographic region, tumour stage, and chemotherapy backbone. Primary endpoints were pathological complete response (reviewed centrally), event-free survival (reviewed by the investigator), and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population, and safety assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03221426, and is closed to accrual. Between Oct 9, 2017, and Jan 25, 2021, of 1254 patients screened, 804 were randomly assigned to the main cohort, of whom 402 were assigned to the pembrolizumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy group and 402 to the placebo plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy group, and 203 to the FLOT cohort, of whom 100 were assigned to the pembrolizumab plus FLOT group and 103 to placebo plus FLOT group. In the main cohort of 804 participants, 575 (72%) were male and 229 (28%) were female. In the main cohort, after median follow-up of 47·7 months (IQR 38·0-54·8), pembrolizumab was superior to placebo for pathological complete response (52 [12·9%; 95% CI 9·8-16·6] of 402 vs eight [2·0%; 0·9-3·9] of 402; difference 10·9%, 95% CI 7·5 to 14·8; p<0·00001). Median event-free survival was longer with pembrolizumab versus placebo (44·4 months, 95% CI 33·0 to not reached vs 25·3 months, 20·6 to 33·9; hazard ratio [HR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·67 to 0·99; p=0·0198) but did not meet the threshold for statistical significance (p=0·0178). Median overall survival was 60·7 months (95% CI 51·5 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 58·0 months (41·5 to not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·73 to 1·12; p=0·174). Grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause occurred in 312 (78%) of 399 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 297 (74%) of 400 patients in the placebo group; the most common were nausea (240 [60%] vs 247 [62%]), anaemia (168 [42%] vs 158 [40%]), and decreased appetite (163 [41%] vs 172 [43%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 102 (26%) and 97 (24%) patients. Treatment-related adverse events that led to death occurred in four (1%) patients in the pembrolizumab group (interstitial ischaemia, pneumonia, decreased appetite, and acute kidney injury [n=1 each]) and two (<1%) patients in the placebo group (neutropenic sepsis and neutropenic colitis [n=1 each]). Although neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab versus placebo improved the pathological complete response, it did not translate to significant improvement in event-free survival in patients with untreated, locally advanced resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal cancer.

"Perioperative Pembrolizumab for Early-Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Among patients with resectable early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a perioperative approach that includes both neoadjuvant and adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition may provide benefit beyond either approach alone. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Participants with resectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (N2 stage) NSCLC were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks, each of which was given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 4 cycles, followed by surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks for up to 13 cycles. The dual primary end points were event-free survival (the time from randomization to the first occurrence of local progression that precluded the planned surgery, unresectable tumor, progression or recurrence, or death) and overall survival. Secondary end points included major pathological response, pathological complete response, and safety. A total of 397 participants were assigned to the pembrolizumab group, and 400 to the placebo group. At the prespecified first interim analysis, the median follow-up was 25.2 months. Event-free survival at 24 months was 62.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 40.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001). The estimated 24-month overall survival was 80.9% in the pembrolizumab group and 77.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.02, which did not meet the significance criterion). A major pathological response occurred in 30.2% of the participants in the pembrolizumab group and in 11.0% of those in the placebo group (difference, 19.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 13.9 to 24.7; P<0.0001; threshold, P = 0.0001), and a pathological complete response occurred in 18.1% and 4.0%, respectively (difference, 14.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 10.1 to 18.7; P<0.0001; threshold, P = 0.0001). Across all treatment phases, 44.9% of the participants in the pembrolizumab group and 37.3% of those in the placebo group had treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher, including 1.0% and 0.8%, respectively, who had grade 5 events. Among patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab significantly improved event-free survival, major pathological response, and pathological complete response as compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone followed by surgery. Overall survival did not differ significantly between the groups in this analysis.

"Phase III placebo-controlled trial of denileukin diftitox for patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. PURPOSE This phase III, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was designed to investigate efficacy and safety of two doses of denileukin diftitox (DD; DAB(389)-interleukin-2 [IL-2]), a recombinant fusion protein targeting IL-2 receptor-expressing malignant T lymphocytes, in patients with stage IA to III, CD25 assay-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), including the mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome forms of the disease, who had received up to three prior therapies. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients (N = 144) with biopsy-confirmed, CD25 assay-positive CTCL were randomly assigned to DD 9 microg/kg/d (n = 45), DD 18 microg/kg/d (n = 55), or placebo infusions (n = 44), administered for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles. Patients were monitored for drug efficacy, clinical benefit, and safety of DD. RESULTS ORR was 44% for all participants treated with DD (n = 100; 10% complete response [CR] and 34% partial response [PR]) compared with 15.9% for placebo-treated patients (2% CR and 13.6% PR). ORR was higher in the 18 microg/kg/d group versus the 9 microg/kg/d group (49.1% v 37.8%, respectively), and both doses were significantly superior to placebo. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer (median, > 2 years) for both DD doses compared with placebo (median, 124 days; P < .001).

"Improved Survival by Adding Lomustine to Conventional Chemotherapy for Elderly Patients With AML Without Unfavorable Cytogenetics: Results of the LAM-SA 2007 FILO Trial. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in elderly patients has a poor prognosis. In an attempt to improve outcome for these patients, the prospective open-label phase III LAM-SA 2007 (Adding Lomustine to Chemotherapy in Older Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and Allogeneic Transplantation for Patients From 60 to 65 Years Old) trial randomly assigned patients to a standard induction regimen with lomustine added or to a consolidation regimen with cytarabine and idarubicin. Adults age 60 years or older with previously untreated AML who were fit to receive intensive chemotherapy and who were without unfavorable cytogenetics received standard chemotherapy with lomustine (idarubicin, cytarabine, and lomustine [ICL]) or without (idarubicin and cytarabine [IC]). The primary objective of the study was overall survival (OS); secondary objectives were response rate, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), event-free survival (EFS), and safety. From February 2008 to December 2011, 459 patients were enrolled. Comparing patients in the IC and ICL arms, complete response or complete response with incomplete recovery was achieved in 74.9% versus 84.7% (<i>P</i> = .01). The proportional hazards assumption was rejected for OS (<i>P</i> = .02), which led us to consider two separate time intervals: during and after induction. There was no significant difference between the two arms during induction, although induction deaths were 3.7% versus 7.7%, respectively (<i>P</i> = .11). However, significantly better results were observed after induction with an improved 2-year OS of 56% in the ICL arm versus 48% in the IC arm (<i>P</i> = .02). At 2 years, EFS was improved at 41% in the ICL arm versus 26% in the IC arm (<i>P</i> = .01). The CIR at 2 years was 41.2% in the ICL arm versus 60.9% in the IC arm (<i>P</i> = .003). Grade 3 and 4 toxicities, mostly hematologic, were significantly higher in the ICL arm (<i>P</i> = .04), and fewer patients required a second treatment after ICL.

"Lenvatinib Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization as First-Line Treatment for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Phase III, Randomized Clinical Trial (LAUNCH). Lenvatinib (LEN) is a first-line therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it has shown modest survival benefits. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once daily for patients ≥ 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 <i>v</i> 11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; <i>P</i> < .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard ratio, 0.43; <i>P</i> < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% <i>v</i> 25.0%, <i>P</i> < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment allocation were independent risk factors for OS.

"Multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 2 trial of FOLFIRI with regorafenib or placebo as second-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits angiogenesis, growth, and proliferation, prolongs survival as monotherapy in patients with refractory colorectal cancer. This international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial assessed the efficacy of regorafenib with folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progressed on first-line oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine enrolled at 45 sites in the United States and Ireland. Patients, stratified by prior bevacizumab use, were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib or placebo. The treatment consisted of FOLFIRI on days 1 and 2 and days 15 and 16 with 160 mg of regorafenib or placebo on days 4 to 10 and days 18 to 24 of every 28-day cycle. Crossover was not allowed. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Under the assumption of a 75% event rate, 180 patients were required for 135 events to achieve 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65 with a 1-sided α value of .1. One hundred eighty-one patients were randomized (120 to regorafenib-FOLFIRI and 61 to placebo-FOLFIRI) with a median age of 62 years. Among these, 117 (65%) received prior bevacizumab or aflibercept. PFS was longer with regorafenib-FOLFIRI than placebo-FOLFIRI (median, 6.1 vs 5.3 months; HR, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.01; log-rank P = .056). The median overall survival was not longer (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.71-1.44). The response rate was higher with regorafenib-FOLFIRI (34%; 95% CI, 25%-44%) than placebo-FOLFIRI (21%; 95% CI, 11%-33%; P = .07). Grade 3/4 adverse events with a >5% absolute increase from regorafenib included diarrhea, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, and hypertension.

"Adjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization for HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Resection: A Randomized Controlled Study. <b>Purpose:</b> The survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after curative resection is usually poor. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HBV-related HCC patients with an intermediate (a single tumor larger than 5 cm without microvascular invasion) or high risk (a single tumor with microvascular invasion, or two or three tumors) of recurrence.<b>Experimental Design:</b> In this randomized phase 3 trial, 280 eligible patients were assigned to adjuvant TACE (<i>n</i> = 140) or no adjuvant treatment (control; <i>n</i> = 140) groups. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards model was used to determine the independent impact of TACE on patients' outcomes.<b>Results:</b> Patients who received adjuvant TACE had a significantly longer RFS than those in the control group [56.0% vs. 42.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.01; HR, 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49-0.93]. Patients in the adjuvant TACE group had 7.8% higher 3-year OS rate than the control group (85.2% vs. 77.4%; <i>P</i> = 0.04; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.97). The impact of adjuvant TACE on RFS and OS remained significant after controlling for other known prognostic factors (HR, 0.67; <i>P</i> = 0.01 for RFS; and HR, 0.59; <i>P</i> = 0.04 for OS). There was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity after adjuvant TACE.<b>Conclusions:</b> For patients with HBV-related HCC who had an intermediate or high risk of recurrence after curative hepatectomy, our study showed adjuvant TACE significantly reduced tumor recurrence, improved RFS and OS, and the procedure was well tolerated. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(9); 2074-81. ©2018 AACR</i>.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29420221/,29420221,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Observation compared to TACE monotherapy when used to treat Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Observation versus TACE monotherapy in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Observation and TACE monotherapy for managing Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Observation versus TACE monotherapy in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Observation when compared with TACE monotherapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Observation in comparison to TACE monotherapy for the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Observation compared to TACE monotherapy for addressing Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Observation and TACE monotherapy in the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Observation against TACE monotherapy for managing Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Observation compared to TACE monotherapy in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Observation contrasted with TACE monotherapy in relation to Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Observation versus TACE monotherapy for treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Observation and TACE monotherapy in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Observation as opposed to TACE monotherapy in managing Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Observation compared to TACE monotherapy in the context of Hepatocellular carcinoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how Observation compares to TACE monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Observation in relation to TACE monotherapy for the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Observation versus TACE monotherapy for managing Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Observation's efficacy in comparison with TACE monotherapy in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Observation against TACE monotherapy regarding Hepatocellular carcinoma.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01966133,"{""29420221"": ""Zheng Wang|Zhenggang Ren|Yi Chen|Jie Hu|Guohuan Yang|Lei Yu|Xinrong Yang|Ao Huang|Xin Zhang|Shaolai Zhou|Huichuan Sun|Yanhong Wang|Ningling Ge|Xiaoyu Xu|Zhaoyou Tang|Wanyee Lau|Jia Fan|Jiping Wang|Jian Zhou""}",2011-08,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Unknown

Daratumumab plus bortezomib/dexamethasone (D-Vd) significantly improved outcomes versus Vd in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in the phase 3 CASTOR study. We report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of the phase 3 LEPUS study of D-Vd versus Vd in Chinese patients with RRMM.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 211 patients were randomized (D-Vd, 141; Vd, 70). After an 8.2-month median follow-up, D-Vd significantly prolonged PFS versus Vd (median, not reached vs. 6.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.47; P < .00001) and significantly improved the rates of overall response (83% vs. 65%; P = .00527), ≥ very good partial response (65% vs. 33%; P = .00002), ≥ complete response (33% vs. 11%; P = .00079), and minimal residual disease negativity (10<sup>-5</sup> sensitivity; 22% vs. 3%; P = .0002).

"Rituximab and dose-dense chemotherapy for adults with Burkitt's lymphoma: a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial. Short intensive chemotherapy is the standard of care for adult patients with Burkitt's leukaemia or lymphoma. Findings from single-arm studies suggest that addition of rituximab to these regimens could improve patient outcomes. Our objective was to test this possibility in a randomised trial. In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients older than 18 years with untreated HIV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma (including Burkitt's leukaemia) from 45 haematological centres in France. Exclusion criteria were contraindications to any drug included in the chemotherapy regimens, any serious comorbidity, poor renal (creatinine concentration >150 μmol/L) or hepatic (cirrhosis or previous hepatitis B or C) function, pregnancy, and any history of cancer except for non-melanoma skin tumours or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma. Patients were stratified into two groups based on disease extension (absence [group B] or presence [group C] of bone marrow or central nervous system involvement). Patients were further stratified in group C according to age (<40 years, 40-60 years, and >60 years) and central nervous system involvement. Participants were randomly assigned in each group to either intravenous rituximab injections and chemotherapy (lymphome malin B [LMB]) or chemotherapy alone by the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte datacentre. Randomisation was stratified by treatment group and centre using computer-assisted permuted-block randomisation (block size of four; allocation ratio 1:1). We gave rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and day 6 during the first two courses of chemotherapy (total of four infusions). The primary endpoint is 3 year event-free survival (EFS). We analysed all patients who had data available according to their originally assigned group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00180882. Between Oct 14, 2004, and Sept 7, 2010, we randomly allocated 260 patients to rituximab or no rituximab (group B 124 patients [64 no rituximab; 60 rituximab]; group C 136 patients [66 no rituximab; 70 rituximab]). With a median follow-up of 38 months (IQR 24-59), patients in the rituximab group achieved better 3 year EFS (75% [95% CI 66-82]) than did those in the no rituximab group (62% [53-70]; log-rank p stratified by treatment group=0·024). The hazard ratio estimated with a Cox model stratified by treatment group, assuming proportionality, was 0·59 for EFS (95% CI 0·38-0·94; p=0·025). Adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups. The most common adverse events were infectious (grade 3-4 in 137 [17%] treatment cycles in the rituximab group vs 115 [15%] in the no rituximab group) and haematological (mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 3·31 days per cycle [95% CI 3·01-3·61] vs 3·38 days per cycle [3·05-3·70]) events.

"Rituximab versus observation after high-dose consolidative first-line chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with poor-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This study compared the induction regimens doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide (ACE) with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, bleomycin and prednisone (ACVBP) before high-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) for patients with poor-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A second randomisation compared rituximab with observation post-ASCT. Four hundred and seventy-six patients <60 years old with newly diagnosed CD20+ DLBCL were randomised to induction with ACE or ACVBP. Three hundred and thirty responders received HDT followed by ASCT. After ASCT, 269 patients were re-randomised to receive either maintenance rituximab or observation alone. Randomisation was stratified by the quality of response to ASCT. The primary end point of this study was event-free survival (EFS).

"Ipatasertib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line therapy for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (LOTUS): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. The oral AKT inhibitor ipatasertib is being investigated in cancers with a high prevalence of PI3K/AKT pathway activation, including triple-negative breast cancer. The LOTUS trial investigated the addition of ipatasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for triple-negative breast cancer. In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial, women aged 18 years or older with measurable, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer previously untreated with systemic therapy were recruited from 44 hospitals in South Korea, the USA, France, Spain, Taiwan, Singapore, Italy, and Belgium. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (days 1, 8, 15) with either ipatasertib 400 mg or placebo once per day (days 1-21) every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was by stratified permuted blocks (block size of four) using an interactive web-response system with three stratification criteria: previous (neo)adjuvant therapy, chemotherapy-free interval, and tumour PTEN status. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population and progression-free survival in the PTEN-low (by immunohistochemistry) population. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02162719). Between Sept 2, 2014, and Feb 4, 2016, 166 patients were assessed for eligibility and 124 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to paclitaxel plus ipatasertib (n=62) or paclitaxel plus placebo (n=62). Median follow-up was 10·4 months (IQR 6·5-14·1) in the ipatasertib group and 10·2 months (6·0-13·6) in the placebo group. Median progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population was 6·2 months (95% CI 3·8-9·0) with ipatasertib versus 4·9 months (3·6-5·4) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·60, 95% CI 0·37-0·98; p=0·037) and in the 48 patients with PTEN-low tumours, median progression-free survival was 6·2 months (95% CI 3·6-9·1) with ipatasertib versus 3·7 months (1·9-7·3) with placebo (stratified HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·26-1·32, p=0·18). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (14 [23%] of 61 ipatasertib-treated patients vs none of 62 placebo-treated patients), neutrophil count decreased (five [8%] vs four [6%]), and neutropenia (six [10%] vs one [2%]). No colitis, grade 4 diarrhoea, or treatment-related deaths were reported with ipatasertib. One treatment-related death occurred in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 17 (28%) of 61 patients in the ipatasertib group and nine (15%) of 62 patients in the placebo group. Progression-free survival was longer in patients who received ipatasertib than in those who received placebo. To our knowledge, these are the first results supporting AKT-targeted therapy for triple-negative breast cancer. Ipatasertib warrants further investigation for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.

"Nintedanib plus pemetrexed versus placebo plus pemetrexed in patients with relapsed or refractory, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LUME-Lung 2): A randomized, double-blind, phase III trial. LUME-Lung 2 investigated the efficacy/safety of nintedanib plus pemetrexed in patients with pretreated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC who had received one prior chemotherapy regimen were randomized (1:1 stratified by histology [adenocarcinoma/non-adenocarcinoma], prior bevacizumab, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and presence of brain metastases) to receive intravenous pemetrexed 500mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 1 plus nintedanib 200mg orally twice daily or matching placebo on Days 2-21, every 3 weeks until progression/unacceptable toxicity. Progression-free survival (PFS) by independent central review was the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint. Based on the pre-planned futility analysis of investigator-assessed PFS, conducted by an independent data monitoring committee, recruitment was halted on 18 June 2011 after 713 (n=353 nintedanib/pemetrexed; n=360 placebo/pemetrexed)/1300 planned patients had enrolled. There were no safety concerns. Subsequent analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS favoring nintedanib/pemetrexed over placebo/pemetrexed (median 4.4 months vs 3.6 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.99, p=0.0435). There was no significant difference in OS (median 12.0 months vs 12.7 months; HR=1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.21, p=0.8940) after 514 deaths. Nintedanib/pemetrexed resulted in a higher incidence of grade ≥3 elevated alanine aminotransferase (23.3% vs 7.3%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (12.1% vs 1.7%) and diarrhea (3.5% vs 1.1%) compared with placebo/pemetrexed, but no difference in hypertension, bleeding or thrombosis.

"Afatinib versus methotrexate as second-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing on or after platinum-based therapy (LUX-Head & Neck 1): an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial. Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) progressing after first-line platinum regimens have a poor prognosis and few treatment options. Afatinib, an irreversible ERBB family blocker, has shown efficacy in a phase 2 study in this setting. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib compared with methotrexate as second-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC progressing on or after platinum-based therapy. In this open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial conducted in 101 centres in 19 countries, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed HNSCC that was recurrent, metastatic, or both who had progressed on or after first-line platinum-based therapy, were not amenable for salvage surgery or radiotherapy, and who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Previous treatment with more than one systemic regimen in this setting was not allowed; previous treatment with EGFR-targeted antibody therapy (but not EGFR-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors) was allowed. We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) or intravenous methotrexate (40 mg/m(2) per week), stratified by ECOG performance status and previous EGFR-targeted antibody therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice or web-based response system. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent, central imaging review committee. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01345682. Between Jan 10, 2012, and Dec 12, 2013, we enrolled 483 patients and randomly assigned 322 to afatinib and 161 to methotrexate. After a median follow-up of 6·7 months (IQR 3·1-9·0), progression-free survival was longer in the afatinib group than in the methotrexate group (median 2·6 months [95% CI 2·0-2·7] for the afatinib group vs 1·7 months [1·5-2·4] for the methotrexate group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·80 [95% CI 0·65-0·98], p=0·030). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were rash or acne (31 [10%] of 320 patients in the afatinib group vs none of 160 patients in the methotrexate group), diarrhoea (30 [9%] vs three [2%]), stomatitis (20 [6%] vs 13 [8%]), fatigue (18 [6%] vs five [3%]), and neutropenia (1 [<1%] vs 11 [7%]); serious adverse events occurred in 44 (14%) of afatinib-treated patients and 18 (11%) of methotrexate-treated patients. Afatinib was associated with significant improvements in progression-free survival and had a manageable safety profile. These findings provide important new insights into the treatment of this patient population and support further investigations with irreversible ERBB family blockers in HNSCC.

"Afatinib versus methotrexate as second-line treatment in Asian patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing on or after platinum-based therapy (LUX-Head & Neck 3): an open-label, randomised phase III trial. Treatment options are limited for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) following progression after first-line platinum-based therapy, particularly in Asian countries. In this randomised, open-label, phase III trial, we enrolled Asian patients aged ≥18 years, with histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent/metastatic HNSCC following first-line platinum-based therapy who were not amenable for salvage surgery or radiotherapy, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0/1. Patients were randomised (2 : 1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) or intravenous methotrexate (40 mg/m2/week), stratified by ECOG performance status and prior EGFR-targeted antibody therapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent central review committee blinded to treatment allocation. A total of 340 patients were randomised (228 afatinib; 112 methotrexate). After a median follow-up of 6.4 months, afatinib significantly decreased the risk of progression/death by 37% versus methotrexate (hazard ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.82; P = 0.0005; median 2.9 versus 2.6 months; landmark analysis at 12 and 24 weeks, 58% versus 41%, 21% versus 9%). Improved PFS was complemented by quality of life benefits. Objective response rate was 28% with afatinib and 13% with methotrexate. There was no significant difference in overall survival. The most common grade ≥3 drug-related adverse events were rash/acne (4% with afatinib versus 0% with methotrexate), diarrhoea (4% versus 0%), fatigue (1% versus 5%), anaemia (<1% versus 5%) and leukopenia (0% versus 5%). Consistent with the phase III LUX-Head & Neck 1 trial, afatinib significantly improved PFS versus methotrexate, with a manageable safety profile. These results demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of afatinib as a second-line treatment option for certain patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.

The irreversible ErbB family blocker afatinib and the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib are approved for first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of afatinib and gefitinib in this setting. This multicentre, international, open-label, exploratory, randomised controlled phase 2B trial (LUX-Lung 7) was done at 64 centres in 13 countries. Treatment-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a common EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive afatinib (40 mg per day) or gefitinib (250 mg per day) until disease progression, or beyond if deemed beneficial by the investigator. Randomisation, stratified by EGFR mutation type and status of brain metastases, was done centrally using a validated number generating system implemented via an interactive voice or web-based response system with a block size of four. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival by independent central review, time-to-treatment failure, and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01466660. Between Dec 13, 2011, and Aug 8, 2013, 319 patients were randomly assigned (160 to afatinib and 159 to gefitinib). Median follow-up was 27·3 months (IQR 15·3-33·9). Progression-free survival (median 11·0 months [95% CI 10·6-12·9] with afatinib vs 10·9 months [9·1-11·5] with gefitinib; hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·57-0·95], p=0·017) and time-to-treatment failure (median 13·7 months [95% CI 11·9-15·0] with afatinib vs 11·5 months [10·1-13·1] with gefitinib; HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·58-0·92], p=0·0073) were significantly longer with afatinib than with gefitinib. Overall survival data are not mature. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (20 [13%] of 160 patients given afatinib vs two [1%] of 159 given gefitinib) and rash or acne (15 [9%] patients given afatinib vs five [3%] of those given gefitinib) and liver enzyme elevations (no patients given afatinib vs 14 [9%] of those given gefitinib). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (11%) patients in the afatinib group and seven (4%) in the gefitinib group. Ten (6%) patients in each group discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events. 15 (9%) fatal adverse events occurred in the afatinib group and ten (6%) in the gefitinib group. All but one of these deaths were considered unrelated to treatment; one patient in the gefitinib group died from drug-related hepatic and renal failure. Afatinib significantly improved outcomes in treatment-naive patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC compared with gefitinib, with a manageable tolerability profile. These data are potentially important for clinical decision making in this patient population.

"Rituximab plus bendamustine or chlorambucil for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: primary analysis of the randomized, open-label MABLE study. MABLE investigated the efficacy and safety of rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab plus chlorambucil in fludarabine-ineligible patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients received rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab plus chlorambucil every four weeks for six cycles. Rituximab plus chlorambucil-treated patients without a complete response after Cycle 6 received chlorambucil monotherapy for at least six additional cycles or until complete response. The primary endpoint was complete response rate (confirmed by bone marrow biopsy) after Cycle 6 in first-line patients. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease, and safety. Overall, 357 patients were randomized (rituximab plus bendamustine, n=178; rituximab plus chlorambucil, n=179; intent-to-treat population), including 241 first-line patients (n=121 and n=120, respectively); 355 patients received treatment (n=177 and n=178, respectively; safety population). In first-line patients, complete response rate after Cycle 6 (rituximab plus bendamustine, 24%; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 9%; <i>P</i>=0.002) and median progression-free survival (rituximab plus bendamustine, 40 months; rituximab plus chlorambucil, 30 months; <i>P</i>=0.003) were higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil. Overall response rate and overall survival were not different. In first-line patients with a complete response, minimal residual disease-negativity was higher with rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus chlorambucil (66% <i>vs</i> 36%).

This multicentre, randomised, and phase II study evaluated mFOLFOX+cetuximab followed by maintenance mFOLFOX+cetuximab or single-agent cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (NCT01161316). Previously, untreated mCRC patients (wild-type KRAS) were randomised to receive cetuximab+mFOLFOX-6 (8 cycles for 2 weeks) followed by maintenance therapy: single-agent cetuximab (Arm-A) or mFOLFOX-6 + cetuximab (Arm-B) until progression. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 9 months. One hundred ninety-three patients (median [range] age 60 [33-74] years) were randomised (2:1): 129 Arm-A versus 64 Arm-B. PFS at 9 months (95% confidence interval) showed non-inferiority between arms (Arm-A/Arm-B: 60 [52, 69]%/72 [61, 83]%, p [non-inferiority]<0.1). There were no statistically significant differences in the PFS (Arm-A/Arm-B: 9 [95% CI 7, 10] months/10 [7,13] months, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19 [0.80, 1.79]) or overall survival (23 [19, 28] months/27 [18, 36] months, HR = 1.24 [0.85, 1.79]) between arms. The objective response rate was also similar (48 [39, 57]%/39 [27, 52]%). The safety profile was similar between arms, and all patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) (Arm-A/Arm-B grade ≥III AEs: 70%/68%). The most common grade ≥III AEs were as follows: neutropenia (Arm-A/Arm-B: 28%/26%), rash acneiform (15%/24%) and sensory neuropathy (2%/15%) in any group. Arm-A was associated with less grade ≥III rash and sensory neuropathy and a lower rate of serious AEs (20%/27%). This phase II exploratory trial with a non-inferiority design suggests that maintenance therapy with single-agent cetuximab following mFOLFOX+cetuximab induction could be a valuable option compared with mFOLFOX+cetuximab treatment continuation.

"Rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. The clinically appropriate duration of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients with acute medical illnesses is unknown. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban administered for an extended period, as compared with subcutaneous enoxaparin administered for a standard period, followed by placebo. We randomly assigned patients 40 years of age or older who were hospitalized for an acute medical illness to receive subcutaneous enoxaparin, 40 mg once daily, for 10±4 days and oral placebo for 35±4 days or to receive subcutaneous placebo for 10±4 days and oral rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, for 35±4 days. The primary efficacy outcomes were the composite of asymptomatic proximal or symptomatic venous thromboembolism up to day 10 (noninferiority test) and up to day 35 (superiority test). The principal safety outcome was the composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. A total of 8101 patients underwent randomization. A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 78 of 2938 patients (2.7%) receiving rivaroxaban and 82 of 2993 patients (2.7%) receiving enoxaparin at day 10 (relative risk with rivaroxaban, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 1.31; P=0.003 for noninferiority) and in 131 of 2967 patients (4.4%) who received rivaroxaban and 175 of 3057 patients (5.7%) who received enoxaparin followed by placebo at day 35 (relative risk, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.02). A principal safety outcome event occurred in 111 of 3997 patients (2.8%) in the rivaroxaban group and 49 of 4001 patients (1.2%) in the enoxaparin group at day 10 (P<0.001) and in 164 patients (4.1%) and 67 patients (1.7%) in the respective groups at day 35 (P<0.001). In acutely ill medical patients, rivaroxaban was noninferior to enoxaparin for standard-duration thromboprophylaxis. Extended-duration rivaroxaban reduced the risk of venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban was associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

"Perioperative chemotherapy versus surgery alone for resectable gastroesophageal cancer. A regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infused fluorouracil (ECF) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of ECF to surgery improves outcomes among patients with potentially curable gastric cancer. We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients). Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and cisplatin (60 mg per square meter) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day) for 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival. ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer. Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery. The resected tumors were significantly smaller and less advanced in the perioperative-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of four years, 149 patients in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and 170 in the surgery group had died. As compared with the surgery group, the perioperative-chemotherapy group had a higher likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.93; P=0.009; five-year survival rate, 36 percent vs. 23 percent) and of progression-free survival (hazard ratio for progression, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.81; P<0.001). In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival.

Amivantamab plus carboplatin-pemetrexed (chemotherapy) with and without lazertinib demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with refractory epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in phase I studies. These combinations were evaluated in a global phase III trial. A total of 657 patients with EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletions or L858R) locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after disease progression on osimertinib were randomized 2 : 2 : 1 to receive amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy, chemotherapy, or amivantamab-chemotherapy. The dual primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) of amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. During the study, hematologic toxicities observed in the amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy arm necessitated a regimen change to start lazertinib after carboplatin completion. All baseline characteristics were well balanced across the three arms, including by history of brain metastases and prior brain radiation. PFS was significantly longer for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) for disease progression or death 0.48 and 0.44, respectively; P < 0.001 for both; median of 6.3 and 8.3 versus 4.2 months, respectively]. Consistent PFS results were seen by investigator assessment (HR for disease progression or death 0.41 and 0.38 for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy, respectively; P < 0.001 for both; median of 8.2 and 8.3 versus 4.2 months, respectively). Objective response rate was significantly higher for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (64% and 63% versus 36%, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Median intracranial PFS was 12.5 and 12.8 versus 8.3 months for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (HR for intracranial disease progression or death 0.55 and 0.58, respectively). Predominant adverse events (AEs) in the amivantamab-containing regimens were hematologic, EGFR-, and MET-related toxicities. Amivantamab-chemotherapy had lower rates of hematologic AEs than amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy. Amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy improved PFS and intracranial PFS versus chemotherapy in a population with limited options after disease progression on osimertinib.

"Carboplatin and Etoposide With or Without Palifosfamide in Untreated Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Multicenter, Adaptive, Randomized Phase III Study (MATISSE). Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of the addition of palifosfamide to carboplatin and etoposide in extensive stage (ES) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients and Methods MATISSE was a randomized, open-label, adaptive phase III study. Previously untreated patients with ES SCLC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to receive carboplatin at area under the serum concentration-time curve 5 on day 1 plus etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1 to 3 every 21 days (CE) or carboplatin at area under the serum concentration-time curve 4 on day 1 plus etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day plus palifosfamide 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1 to 3 every 21 days (PaCE). The primary end point was overall survival. Results In all, 188 patients were enrolled; 94 patients received CE and 94 patients received PaCE. The median age on both arms was 61 years. Six cycles of chemotherapy were completed on both arms of the study by approximately 50% of the patients. Serious adverse events were documented and did not differ significantly between patients receiving PaCE and those receiving CE. Median overall survival was similar between both arms with 10.03 months on PaCE and 10.37 months on CE ( P = .096).

"Randomized phase 2 study of low-dose decitabine vs low-dose azacitidine in lower-risk MDS and MDS/MPN. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) improve survival in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but are less well-studied in lower-risk disease. We compared the safety and efficacy of low-dose decitabine vs low-dose azacitidine in this group of patients. Adults with low- or intermediate 1-risk MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, were randomly assigned using a Bayesian adaptive design to receive either azacitidine 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously/subcutaneously daily or decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously daily for 3 consecutive days on a 28-day cycle. The primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR). Between November 2012 and February 2016, 113 patients were treated: 40 (35%) with azacitidine and 73 (65%) with decitabine. The median age was 70 years; 81% of patients were intermediate 1-risk patients. The median number of cycles received was 9. The ORRs were 70% and 49% (<i>P</i> = .03) for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively. Thirty-two percent of patients treated with decitabine became transfusion independent compared with 16% of patients treated with azacitidine (<i>P</i> = .2). Cytogenetic response rates were 61% and 25% (<i>P</i> = .02), respectively. With a median follow-up of 20 months, the overall median event-free survival was 18 months: 20 and 13 months for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively (<i>P</i> = .1). Treatment was well tolerated, with a 6-week mortality rate of 0%. The use of low-dose HMAs is safe and effective in patients with lower-risk MDS and MDS/MPN.

"A randomized study of clofarabine versus clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine as front-line therapy for patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. We previously reported the feasibility of clofarabine and cytarabine combinations in AML. Questions remain as to (1) the therapeutic advantage of this combination and (2) the role of lower doses of clofarabine and cytarabine in older patients. We have conducted an adaptively randomized study of lower-dose clofarabine with or without low-dose cytarabine in previously untreated patients with AML aged 60 years and older. Patients received 30 mg/m(2) clofarabine intravenously daily for 5 days with or without 20 mg/m(2) cytarabine subcutaneously daily for 14 days as induction. Consolidation consisted of 3 days of clofarabine with or without 7 days of cytarabine. Seventy patients were enrolled. The median age was 71 years (range, 60-83 years). Sixteen patients received clofarabine and 54 the combination. Overall, 56% achieved complete remission (CR). CR rate was significantly higher with the combination (63% vs 31%; P = .025).

"Prospective phase II study of rituximab with alternating cycles of hyper-CVAD and high-dose methotrexate with cytarabine for young patients with high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We conducted a prospective randomized phase II study to evaluate two chemotherapy regimens: (i) rituximab plus hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (R-HCVAD) alternating with rituximab, high-dose methotrexate, and cytarabine (R-MA) and (ii) rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This study randomized patients aged ≤60 years with DLBCL and an age-adjusted international prognostic index ≥2 to R-HCVAD/R-MA or R-CHOP based on a Bayesian adaptive algorithm. Interim analysis of the first 26 eligible patients showed that the complete response rate (CRR) was higher with R-HCVAD/R-MA than R-CHOP (P = 0·03); thus, R-CHOP arm was closed. In the final analysis, 49 and 10 eligible patients were treated in R-HCVAD/R-MA and R-CHOP arms respectively; CRR were 82% and 60% respectively (P = 0·13); 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 75·7% and 77·8% respectively (P = 0·53).

"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy with or without immunotherapy for early-stage or isolated lung parenchymal recurrent node-negative non-small-cell lung cancer: an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is the standard treatment for medically inoperable early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but regional or distant relapses, or both, are common. Immunotherapy reduces recurrence and improves survival in people with stage III NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy, but its utility in stage I and II cases is unclear. We therefore conducted a randomised phase 2 trial of SABR alone compared with SABR with immunotherapy (I-SABR) for people with early-stage NSCLC. We did an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial comparing SABR to I-SABR, conducted at three different hospitals in TX, USA. People aged 18 years or older with histologically proven treatment-naive stage IA-IB (tumour size ≤4 cm, N0M0), stage IIA (tumour size ≤5 cm, N0M0), or stage IIB (tumour size >5 cm and ≤7 cm, N0M0) as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer version 8 staging system or isolated parenchymal recurrences (tumour size ≤7 cm) NSCLC (T<sub>any</sub>N<sub>any</sub>M0 before definitive surgery or chemoradiotherapy) were included in this trial. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1; using the Pocock & Simon method) to receive SABR with or without four cycles of nivolumab (480 mg, once every 4 weeks, with the first dose on the same day as, or within 36 h after, the first SABR fraction). This trial was unmasked. The primary endpoint was 4-year event-free survival (local, regional, or distant recurrence; second primary lung cancer; or death). Analyses were both intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03110978) and is closed to enrolment. From June 30, 2017, to March 22, 2022, 156 participants were randomly assigned, and 141 participants received assigned therapy. At a median 33 months' follow-up, I-SABR significantly improved 4-year event-free survival from 53% (95% CI 42-67%) with SABR to 77% (66-91%; per-protocol population, hazard ratio [HR] 0·38; 95% CI 0·19-0·75; p=0·0056; ITT population, HR 0·42; 95% CI 0·22-0·80; p=0·0080). There were no grade 3 or higher adverse events associated with SABR. In the I-SABR group, ten participants (15%) had grade 3 immunologial adverse events related to nivolumab; none had grade 3 pneumonitis or grade 4 or higher toxicity. Compared with SABR alone, I-SABR significantly improved event-free survival at 4 years in people with early-stage treatment-naive or lung parenchymal recurrent node-negative NSCLC, with tolerable toxicity. I-SABR could be a treatment option in these participants, but further confirmation from a number of currently accruing phase 3 trials is required.

"Randomized Phase III Study of Lenalidomide Versus Placebo in RBC Transfusion-Dependent Patients With Lower-Risk Non-del(5q) Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Ineligible for or Refractory to Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents. This international phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in RBC transfusion-dependent patients with International Prognostic Scoring System lower-risk non-del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes ineligible for or refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In total, 239 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to treatment with lenalidomide (n = 160) or placebo (n = 79) once per day (on 28-day cycles). The primary end point was the rate of RBC transfusion independence (TI) ≥ 8 weeks. Secondary end points were RBC-TI ≥ 24 weeks, duration of RBC-TI, erythroid response, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and safety. RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks was achieved in 26.9% and 2.5% of patients in the lenalidomide and placebo groups, respectively (P < .001). Ninety percent of patients achieving RBC-TI responded within 16 weeks of treatment. Median duration of RBC-TI with lenalidomide was 30.9 weeks (95% CI, 20.7 to 59.1). Transfusion reduction of ≥ 4 units packed RBCs, on the basis of a 112-day assessment, was 21.8% in the lenalidomide group and 0% in the placebo group. Higher response rates were observed in patients with lower baseline endogenous erythropoietin ≤ 500 mU/mL (34.0% v 15.5% for > 500 mU/mL). At week 12, mean changes in HRQoL scores from baseline did not differ significantly between treatment groups, which suggests that lenalidomide did not adversely affect HRQoL. Achievement of RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks was associated with significant improvements in HRQoL (P < .01). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Lenalidomide yields sustained RBC-TI in 26.9% of RBC transfusion-dependent patients with lower-risk non-del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes ineligible for or refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Response to lenalidomide was associated with improved HRQoL. Treatment-emergent adverse event data were consistent with the known safety profile of lenalidomide.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27354480/,27354480,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy when used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Placebo versus Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Placebo and Lenalidomide monotherapy for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Placebo versus Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Placebo when compared with Lenalidomide monotherapy for Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Placebo in comparison to Lenalidomide monotherapy for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy for addressing Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Placebo and Lenalidomide monotherapy in the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Lenalidomide monotherapy for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Placebo compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Placebo contrasted with Lenalidomide monotherapy in relation to Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Placebo versus Lenalidomide monotherapy for treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Placebo and Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Placebo as opposed to Lenalidomide monotherapy in managing Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy in the context of Myelodysplastic syndrome.,What option most accurately summarizes how Placebo compares to Lenalidomide monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Placebo in relation to Lenalidomide monotherapy for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Placebo versus Lenalidomide monotherapy for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Placebo's efficacy in comparison with Lenalidomide monotherapy in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Lenalidomide monotherapy regarding Myelodysplastic syndrome.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01029262,"{""27354480"": ""Valeria Santini|Antonio Almeida|Aristoteles Giagounidis|Stefanie Gröpper|Anna Jonasova|Norbert Vey|Ghulam J Mufti|Rena Buckstein|Moshe Mittelman|Uwe Platzbecker|Ofer Shpilberg|Ron Ram|Consuelo Del Cañizo|Norbert Gattermann|Keiya Ozawa|Alberto Risueño|Kyle J MacBeth|Jianhua Zhong|Francis Séguy|Albert Hoenekopp|C L Beach|Pierre Fenaux""}",2010-01-26,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Immunomodulatory Drugs
"Carboplatin-based doublet plus bevacizumab beyond progression versus carboplatin-based doublet alone in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer: a randomised, phase 3 trial. Bevacizumab is approved in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, either in first-line therapy or for patients with recurrent disease not previously treated with the same drug. We aimed to test the value of continuing bevacizumab beyond progression after first-line treatment with the same drug. In our open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial done at 82 sites in four countries, we enrolled women (aged ≥18 years) who had previously received first-line platinum-based therapy including bevacizumab, and had recurrent (≥6 months since last platinum dose), International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stage IIIB-IV ovarian cancer with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a carboplatin-based doublet intravenously (carboplatin area under the concentration curve [AUC] 5 on day 1 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, every 21 days; carboplatin AUC 4 on day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8, every 21 days; or carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1 plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, every 28 days), or a carboplatin-based doublet plus bevacizumab (10 mg/kg intravenous every 14 days combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-carboplatin, or 15 mg/kg every 21 days combined with gemcitabine-carboplatin or paclitaxel-carboplatin). Evaluable disease according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines was required before randomisation. Randomisation was done through the trial website with a minimisation procedure, stratified by centre, time of recurrence, performance status, and type of second-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01802749 and EudraCT 2012-004362-17. Between Dec 6, 2013, and Nov 11, 2016, 406 patients were recruited (203 [50%] assigned to the bevacizumab group and 203 [50%] to the standard chemotherapy group). 130 patients (64%) in the bevacizumab group and 131 (65%) in the standard chemotherapy group had progressed after receiving a last dose of platinum more than 12 months before, and 146 patients (72%) in the bevacizumab group and 147 (72%) in the standard chemotherapy group had progressed after completion of first-line bevacizumab maintenance. 161 participants (79%) progressed in the standard chemotherapy group, as did 143 (70%) in the bevacizumab group. Median progression-free survival was 8·8 months (95% CI 8·4-9·3) in the standard chemotherapy group and 11·8 months (10·8-12·9) in the bevacizumab group (hazard ratio 0·51, 95% CI 0·41-0·65; log-rank p<0·0001). Most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (20 [10%] in the standard chemotherapy group vs 58 (29%) in the bevacizumab group), neutrophil count decrease (81 [41%] vs 80 [40%]), and platelet count decrease (43 [22%] vs 61 [30%]). 68 patients (33%) died in the standard chemotherapy group and 79 (39%) died in the bevacizumab group; two deaths (1%) in the standard chemotherapy group and one death (<1%) in the bevacizumab group were deemed to be treatment-related. Continuing bevacizumab beyond progression combined with chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer improves progression-free survival compared with standard chemotherapy alone and might be considered in clinical practice.

To compare capecitabine/cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). In this randomised, open-label, phase III study, patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2) i.v. day 1) plus oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) b.i.d., days 1-14) (XP) or 5-FU (800 mg/m(2)/day by continuous infusion, days 1-5) (FP) every 3 weeks. The primary end point was to confirm noninferiority of XP versus FP for progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 316 patients were randomised to XP (n = 160) or FP (n = 156). In the per-protocol population, median PFS for XP (n = 139) versus FP (n = 137) was 5.6 versus 5.0 months.

"Continuation of bevacizumab after first progression in metastatic colorectal cancer (ML18147): a randomised phase 3 trial. Bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is standard treatment for first-line and bevacizumab-naive second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We assessed continued use of bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer progressing after standard first-line bevacizumab-based treatment. In an open-label, phase 3 study in 220 centres in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, patients (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable, histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer progressing up to 3 months after discontinuing first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to second-line chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab 2·5 mg/kg per week equivalent (either 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7·5 mg/kg every 3 weeks, intravenously). The choice between oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy depended on the first-line regimen (switch of chemotherapy). A combination of a permuted block design and the Pocock and Simon minimisation algorithm was used for the randomisation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700102. Between Feb 1, 2006, and June 9, 2010, 409 (50%) patients were assigned to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 411 (50%) to chemotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 11·1 months (IQR 6·4-15·6) in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and 9·6 months (5·4-13·9) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 11·2 months (95% CI 10·4-12·2) for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 9·8 months (8·9-10·7) for chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·69-0·94; unstratified log-rank test p=0·0062). Grade 3-5 bleeding or haemorrhage (eight [2%] vs one [<1%]), gastrointestinal perforation (seven [2%] vs three [<1%]), and venous thromboembolisms (19 [5%] vs 12 [3%]) were more common in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group. The most frequently reported grade 3-5 adverse events were neutropenia (65 [16%] in the bevacizumab and chemotherapy group vs 52 [13%] in the chemotherapy alone group), diarrhoea (40 [10%] vs 34 [8%], respectively), and asthenia (23 [6%] vs 17 [4%], respectively). Treatment-related deaths were reported for four patients in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and three in the chemotherapy alone group.

"Continuous lenalidomide treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide has tumoricidal and immunomodulatory activity against multiple myeloma. This double-blind, multicenter, randomized study compared melphalan-prednisone-lenalidomide induction followed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR-R) with melphalan-prednisone-lenalidomide (MPR) or melphalan-prednisone (MP) followed by placebo in patients 65 years of age or older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We randomly assigned patients who were ineligible for transplantation to receive MPR-R (nine 4-week cycles of MPR followed by lenalidomide maintenance therapy until a relapse or disease progression occurred [152 patients]) or to receive MPR (153 patients) or MP (154 patients) without maintenance therapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival. The median follow-up period was 30 months. The median progression-free survival was significantly longer with MPR-R (31 months) than with MPR (14 months; hazard ratio, 0.49; P<0.001) or MP (13 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001). Response rates were superior with MPR-R and MPR (77% and 68%, respectively, vs. 50% with MP; P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively, for the comparison with MP). The progression-free survival benefit associated with MPR-R was noted in patients 65 to 75 years of age but not in those older than 75 years of age (P=0.001 for treatment-by-age interaction). After induction therapy, a landmark analysis showed a 66% reduction in the rate of progression with MPR-R (hazard ratio for the comparison with MPR, 0.34; P<0.001) that was age-independent. During induction therapy, the most frequent adverse events were hematologic; grade 4 neutropenia was reported in 35%, 32%, and 8% of the patients in the MPR-R, MPR, and MP groups, respectively. The 3-year rate of second primary tumors was 7% with MPR-R, 7% with MPR, and 3% with MP. MPR-R significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for transplantation, with the greatest benefit observed in patients 65 to 75 years of age.

This prospective multicenter phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of a triple combination (bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone [VTD]) versus a dual combination (thalidomide-dexamethasone [TD]) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) progressing or relapsing after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Overall, 269 patients were randomly assigned to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus) or no bortezomib for 1 year, in combination with thalidomide (200 mg per day orally) and dexamethasone (40 mg orally once a day on 4 days once every 3 weeks). Bortezomib was administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with a 10-day rest period (day 12 to day 21) for eight cycles (6 months), and then on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with a 20-day rest period (day 23 to day 42) for four cycles (6 months).

"Autologous transplantation and maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma. This open-label, randomized, phase 3 study compared melphalan at a dose of 200 mg per square meter of body-surface area plus autologous stem-cell transplantation with melphalan-prednisone-lenalidomide (MPR) and compared lenalidomide maintenance therapy with no maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We randomly assigned 273 patients 65 years of age or younger to high-dose melphalan plus stem-cell transplantation or MPR consolidation therapy after induction, and 251 patients to lenalidomide maintenance therapy or no maintenance therapy.

"Fludarabine and cytosine are less effective than standard ADE chemotherapy in high-risk acute myeloid leukemia, and addition of G-CSF and ATRA are not beneficial: results of the MRC AML-HR randomized trial. The optimum chemotherapy schedule for reinduction of patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (relapsed, resistant/refractory, or adverse genetic disease) is uncertain. The MRC AML (Medical Research Council Acute Myeloid Leukemia) Working Group designed a trial comparing fludarabine and high-dose cytosine (FLA) with standard chemotherapy comprising cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE). Patients were also randomly assigned to receive filgrastim (G-CSF) from day 0 until neutrophil count was greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L (or for a maximum of 28 days) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 90 days. Between 1998 and 2003, 405 patients were entered: 250 were randomly assigned between FLA and ADE; 356 to G-CSF versus no G-CSF; 362 to ATRA versus no ATRA. The complete remission rate was 61% with 4-year disease-free survival of 29%. There were no significant differences in the CR rate, deaths in CR, relapse rate, or DFS between ADE and FLA, although survival at 4 years was worse with FLA (16% versus 27%, P = .05). Neither the addition of ATRA nor G-CSF demonstrated any differences in the CR rate, relapse rate, DFS, or overall survival between the groups. In conclusion these findings indicate that FLA may be inferior to standard chemotherapy in high-risk AML and that the outcome is not improved with the addition of either G-CSF or ATRA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16484584/,16484584,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of FLA compared to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) when used to treat Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of FLA versus ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of FLA and ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for managing Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of FLA versus ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of FLA when compared with ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for Acute myeloid leukemia?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of FLA in comparison to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of FLA compared to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for addressing Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of FLA and ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of FLA against ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for managing Acute myeloid leukemia.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of FLA compared to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of FLA contrasted with ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in relation to Acute myeloid leukemia?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of FLA versus ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of FLA and ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in treating Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of FLA as opposed to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in managing Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of FLA compared to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in the context of Acute myeloid leukemia.,What option most accurately summarizes how FLA compares to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in terms of effectiveness for Acute myeloid leukemia?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of FLA in relation to ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for the treatment of Acute myeloid leukemia.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of FLA versus ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) for managing Acute myeloid leukemia?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of FLA's efficacy in comparison with ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) in treating Acute myeloid leukemia.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of FLA against ADE (standard-dose Ara-C) regarding Acute myeloid leukemia.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00005863,"{""16484584"": ""Donald W Milligan|Keith Wheatley|Timothy Littlewood|Jenny I O Craig|Alan K Burnett|NCRI Haematological Oncology Clinical Studies Group""}",1998-08,No,No,Unknown,Unknown
"Preoperative radiotherapy versus selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer (MRC CR07 and NCIC-CTG C016): a multicentre, randomised trial. Preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence in patients with operable rectal cancer. However, improvements in surgery and histopathological assessment mean that the role of radiotherapy needs to be reassessed. We compared short-course preoperative radiotherapy versus initial surgery with selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy. We undertook a randomised trial in 80 centres in four countries. 1350 patients with operable adenocarcinoma of the rectum were randomly assigned, by a minimisation procedure, to short-course preoperative radiotherapy (25 Gy in five fractions; n=674) or to initial surgery with selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent 5-fluorouracil) restricted to patients with involvement of the circumferential resection margin (n=676). The primary outcome measure was local recurrence. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 28785842. At the time of analysis, which included all participants, 330 patients had died (157 preoperative radiotherapy group vs 173 selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy), and median follow-up of surviving patients was 4 years. 99 patients had developed local recurrence (27 preoperative radiotherapy vs 72 selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy). We noted a reduction of 61% in the relative risk of local recurrence for patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.27-0.58, p<0.0001), and an absolute difference at 3 years of 6.2% (95% CI 5.3-7.1) (4.4% preoperative radiotherapy vs 10.6% selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy). We recorded a relative improvement in disease-free survival of 24% for patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p=0.013), and an absolute difference at 3 years of 6.0% (95% CI 5.3-6.8) (77.5%vs 71.5%). Overall survival did not differ between the groups (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73-1.13, p=0.40).

"Chemotherapy options in elderly and frail patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MRC FOCUS2): an open-label, randomised factorial trial. Elderly and frail patients with cancer, although often treated with chemotherapy, are under-represented in clinical trials. We designed FOCUS2 to investigate reduced-dose chemotherapy options and to seek objective predictors of outcome in frail patients with advanced colorectal cancer. We undertook an open, 2 × 2 factorial trial in 61 UK centres for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer who were considered unfit for full-dose chemotherapy. After comprehensive health assessment (CHA), patients were randomly assigned by minimisation to: 48-h intravenous fluorouracil with levofolinate (group A); oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (group B); capecitabine (group C); or oxaliplatin and capecitabine (group D). Treatment allocation was not masked. Starting doses were 80% of standard doses, with discretionary escalation to full dose after 6 weeks. The two primary outcome measures were: addition of oxaliplatin ([A vs B] + [C vs D]), assessed with progression-free survival (PFS); and substitution of fluorouracil with capecitabine ([A vs C] + [B vs D]), assessed by change from baseline to 12 weeks in global quality of life (QoL). Analysis was by intention to treat. Baseline clinical and CHA data were modelled against outcomes with a novel composite measure, overall treatment utility (OTU). This study is registered, number ISRCTN21221452. 459 patients were randomly assigned (115 to each of groups A-C, 114 to group D). Factorial comparison of addition of oxaliplatin versus no addition suggested some improvement in PFS, but the finding was not significant (median 5·8 months [IQR 3·3-7·5] vs 4·5 months [2·8-6·4]; hazard ratio 0·84, 95% CI 0·69-1·01, p=0·07). Replacement of fluorouracil with capecitabine did not improve global QoL: 69 of 124 (56%) patients receiving fluorouracil reported improvement in global QoL compared with 69 of 123 (56%) receiving capecitabine. The risk of having any grade 3 or worse toxic effect was not significantly increased with oxaliplatin (83/219 [38%] vs 70/221 [32%]; p=0·17), but was higher with capecitabine than with fluorouracil (88/222 [40%] vs 65/218 [30%]; p=0·03). In multivariable analysis, fewer baseline symptoms (odds ratio 1·32, 95% CI 1·14-1·52), less widespread disease (1·51, 1·05-2·19), and use of oxaliplatin (0·57, 0·39-0·82) were predictive of better OTU. FOCUS2 shows that with an appropriate design, including reduced starting doses of chemotherapy, frail and elderly patients can participate in a randomised controlled trial.

"Ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide with midcycle vincristine versus standard chemotherapy in patients with small-cell lung cancer and good performance status: clinical and quality-of-life results of the British Medical Research Council multicenter randomized LU21 trial. Ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine, alone and in combination, are highly active against small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). This trial was designed to investigate whether survival could be improved by a regimen of all four drugs (ICE-V) compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with SCLC and good performance status, and to assess the patients' quality of life (QL). Patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of either ICE-V at 4-week intervals without dose reduction or standard chemotherapy administered according to local practice. The recommended standard control regimens were cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide; and cisplatin and etoposide. A total of 402 patients were randomly assigned, and 350 (87%) patients have died. Overall survival was longer in the ICE-V group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.91; P = .0049), median survival was 15.6 months in the ICE-V group and 11.6 months in the control group, and 2-year survival rates were 20% and 11%, respectively. There was no evidence that the relative survival benefit for ICE-V was less in extensive-stage than in limited-stage patients. An increased rate of septicemia was reported in the ICE-V group (15% v 7% in the control group), but this did not result in an increase in reported treatment-related deaths (four patients [2%] in both groups). The findings on QL were broadly similar in both groups, with some benefit in favor of ICE-V. Compared with standard chemotherapy, the ICE-V regimen improves overall survival without QL penalties, despite an increased but manageable level of toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16293867/,16293867,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of ICE-V compared to CDE when used to treat Small cell lung cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of ICE-V versus CDE in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of ICE-V and CDE for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of ICE-V versus CDE in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of ICE-V when compared with CDE for Small cell lung cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of ICE-V in comparison to CDE for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of ICE-V compared to CDE for addressing Small cell lung cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of ICE-V and CDE in the treatment of Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of ICE-V against CDE for managing Small cell lung cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of ICE-V compared to CDE in treating Small cell lung cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of ICE-V contrasted with CDE in relation to Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of ICE-V versus CDE for treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of ICE-V and CDE in treating Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of ICE-V as opposed to CDE in managing Small cell lung cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of ICE-V compared to CDE in the context of Small cell lung cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how ICE-V compares to CDE in terms of effectiveness for Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of ICE-V in relation to CDE for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of ICE-V versus CDE for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of ICE-V's efficacy in comparison with CDE in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of ICE-V against CDE regarding Small cell lung cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00002822,"{""16293867"": ""Nicholas Thatcher|Wendi Qian|Peter I Clark|Penelope Hopwood|Robert J Sambrook|Robert Owens|Richard J Stephens|David J Girling""}",1996-03,No,No,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy
"High-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem-cell rescue for multiple myeloma. High-dose therapy with supporting autologous stem-cell transplantation remains a controversial treatment for cancer. In multiple myeloma, first-line regimens incorporating high-dose therapy yield higher remission rates than do conventional-dose treatments, but evidence that this translates into improved survival is limited. In this multicenter study, the Medical Research Council Myeloma VII Trial, we randomly assigned 407 patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who were younger than 65 years of age to receive either standard conventional-dose combination chemotherapy or high-dose therapy and an autologous stem-cell transplant. Among the 401 patients who could be evaluated, the rates of complete response were higher in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (44 percent vs. 8 percent, P<0.001). The rates of partial response were similar (42 percent and 40 percent, respectively; P=0.72), and the rates of minimal response were lower in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (3 percent vs. 18 percent, P<0.001). Intention-to-treat analysis showed a higher rate of overall survival (P=0.04 by the log-rank test) and progression-free survival (P<0.001) in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group. As compared with standard therapy, intensive treatment increased median survival by almost 1 year (54.1 months [95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 65.2] vs. 42.3 months [95 percent confidence interval, 33.1 to 51.6]). There was a trend toward a greater survival benefit in the group of patients with a poor prognosis, as defined by a high beta2-microglobulin level (more than 8 mg per liter).

"Active symptom control with or without chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MS01): a multicentre randomised trial. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is almost always fatal, and few treatment options are available. Although active symptom control (ASC) has been recommended for the management of this disease, no consensus exists for the role of chemotherapy. We investigated whether the addition of chemotherapy to ASC improved survival and quality of life. 409 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, from 76 centres in the UK and two in Australia, were randomly assigned to ASC alone (treatment could include steroids, analgesic drugs, bronchodilators, palliative radiotherapy [n=136]); to ASC plus MVP (four cycles of mitomycin 6 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks [n=137]); or to ASC plus vinorelbine (one injection of vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 every week for 12 weeks [n=136]). Randomisation was done by minimisation, with stratification for WHO performance status, histology, and centre. Follow-up was every 3 weeks to 21 weeks after randomisation, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Because of slow accrual, the two chemotherapy groups were combined and compared with ASC alone for the primary outcome of overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN54469112. At the time of analysis, 393 (96%) patients had died (ASC 132 [97%], ASC plus MVP 132 [96%], ASC plus vinorelbine 129 [95%]). Compared with ASC alone, we noted a small, non-significant survival benefit for ASC plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89 [95% CI 0.72-1.10]; p=0.29). Median survival was 7.6 months in the ASC alone group and 8.5 months in the ASC plus chemotherapy group. Exploratory analyses suggested a survival advantage for ASC plus vinorelbine compared with ASC alone (HR 0.80 [0.63-1.02]; p=0.08), with a median survival of 9.5 months. There was no evidence of a survival benefit with ASC plus MVP (HR 0.99 [0.78-1.27]; p=0.95). We observed no between-group differences in four predefined quality-of-life subscales (physical functioning, pain, dyspnoea, and global health status) at any of the assessments in the first 6 months. The addition of chemotherapy to ASC offers no significant benefits in terms of overall survival or quality of life.

"Durvalumab With or Without Tremelimumab vs Standard Chemotherapy in First-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The MYSTIC Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial. Checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death 1 or its ligand (PD-L1) as monotherapies or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 have shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. To compare durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. This open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial (MYSTIC) was conducted at 203 cancer treatment centers in 17 countries. Patients with treatment-naive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had no sensitizing EGFR or ALK genetic alterations were randomized to receive treatment with durvalumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab, or chemotherapy. Data were collected from July 21, 2015, to October 30, 2018. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive treatment with durvalumab (20 mg/kg every 4 weeks), durvalumab (20 mg/kg every 4 weeks) plus tremelimumab (1 mg/kg every 4 weeks, up to 4 doses), or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The primary end points, assessed in patients with ≥25% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, were overall survival (OS) for durvalumab vs chemotherapy, and OS and progression-free survival (PFS) for durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs chemotherapy. Analysis of blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) was exploratory. Between July 21, 2015, and June 8, 2016, 1118 patients were randomized. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Among 488 patients with ≥25% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, median OS was 16.3 months (95% CI, 12.2-20.8) with durvalumab vs 12.9 months (95% CI, 10.5-15.0) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 97.54% CI, 0.56-1.02; P = .04 [nonsignificant]). Median OS was 11.9 months (95% CI, 9.0-17.7) with durvalumab plus tremelimumab (HR vs chemotherapy, 0.85; 98.77% CI, 0.61-1.17; P = .20). Median PFS was 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.0) with durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.6-5.8) with chemotherapy (HR, 1.05; 99.5% CI, 0.72-1.53; P = .71). Among 809 patients with evaluable bTMB, those with a bTMB ≥20 mutations per megabase showed improved OS for durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs chemotherapy (median OS, 21.9 months [95% CI, 11.4-32.8] vs 10.0 months [95% CI, 8.1-11.7]; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.74). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 55 (14.9%) of 369 patients who received treatment with durvalumab, 85 (22.9%) of 371 patients who received treatment with durvalumab plus tremelimumab, and 119 (33.8%) of 352 patients who received treatment with chemotherapy. These adverse events led to death in 2 (0.5%), 6 (1.6%), and 3 (0.9%) patients, respectively. The phase 3 MYSTIC study did not meet its primary end points of improved OS with durvalumab vs chemotherapy or improved OS or PFS with durvalumab plus tremelimumab vs chemotherapy in patients with ≥25% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1.

MabEase (<i>clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: 01649856</i>) examined efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction with subcutaneous rituximab plus chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients were randomized 2:1 to subcutaneous rituximab (intravenous 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cycle 1; subcutaneous 1,400 mg cycles 2-8) or intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cycles 1-8) plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone every 14 or 21 days. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed complete response/unconfirmed complete response. Secondary endpoints included safety, treatment satisfaction (Cancer Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire and Rituximab Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire), time savings, and survival. Of 576 randomized patients, 572 (378 subcutaneous; 194 intravenous) received treatment.

"Effect of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or without cetuximab on survival among patients with resected stage III colon cancer: a randomized trial. Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard adjuvant therapy for resected stage III colon cancer. Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX benefits patients with metastatic wild-type KRAS but not mutated KRAS colon cancer. To assess the potential benefit of cetuximab added to the modified sixth version of the FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) in patients with resected stage III wild-type KRAS colon cancer. A randomized trial of 2686 patients aged 18 years or older at multiple institutions across North America enrolled following resection and informed consent between February 10, 2004, and November 25, 2009. The primary randomized comparison was 12 biweekly cycles of mFOLFOX6 with and without cetuximab. KRAS mutation status was centrally determined. The trial was halted after a planned interim analysis of 48% of predicted events (246/515) occurring in 1863 (of 2070 planned) patients with tumors having wild-type KRAS. A total of 717 patients with mutated KRAS and 106 with indeterminate KRAS were accrued. The 2070 patients with wild-type KRAS provided 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 (2-sided α = .05), with planned interim efficacy analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected relapses. Disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. Median (range) follow-up was 28 (0-68) months. The trial demonstrated no benefit when adding cetuximab. Three-year disease-free survival for mFOLFOX6 alone was 74.6% vs 71.5% with the addition of cetuximab (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = .08) in patients with wild-type KRAS, and 67.1% vs 65.0% (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.46; P = .38) in patients with mutated KRAS, with no significant benefit in any subgroups assessed. Among all patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events (72.5% vs 52.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P < .001) and failure to complete 12 cycles (33% vs 23%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P < .001) were significantly higher with cetuximab. Increased toxicity and greater detrimental differences in all outcomes were observed in patients aged 70 years or older. Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer, the use of cetuximab with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 compared with mFOLFOX6 alone did not result in improved disease-free survival. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079274.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22474202/,22474202,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab compared to mFOLFOX6 when used to treat Colon cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab versus mFOLFOX6 in treating Colon cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 for managing Colon cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab versus mFOLFOX6 in treating Colon cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab when compared with mFOLFOX6 for Colon cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab in comparison to mFOLFOX6 for the treatment of Colon cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab compared to mFOLFOX6 for addressing Colon cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 in the treatment of Colon cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab against mFOLFOX6 for managing Colon cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab compared to mFOLFOX6 in treating Colon cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab contrasted with mFOLFOX6 in relation to Colon cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab versus mFOLFOX6 for treating Colon cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 in treating Colon cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab as opposed to mFOLFOX6 in managing Colon cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab compared to mFOLFOX6 in the context of Colon cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab compares to mFOLFOX6 in terms of effectiveness for Colon cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab in relation to mFOLFOX6 for the treatment of Colon cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab versus mFOLFOX6 for managing Colon cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab's efficacy in comparison with mFOLFOX6 in treating Colon cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab against mFOLFOX6 regarding Colon cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00079274,"{""22474202"": ""Steven R Alberts|Daniel J Sargent|Suresh Nair|Michelle R Mahoney|Margaret Mooney|Stephen N Thibodeau|Thomas C Smyrk|Frank A Sinicrope|Emily Chan|Sharlene Gill|Morton S Kahlenberg|Anthony F Shields|James T Quesenberry|Thomas A Webb|Gist H Farr|Barbara A Pockaj|Axel Grothey|Richard M Goldberg""}",2004-02,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Antimetabolites|Platinum-based Chemotherapy|Chemotherapy
"A randomized phase 2 study of temozolomide and bevacizumab or nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma : a North Central Cancer Treatment Group study, N0775. Increasing evidence shows chemotherapy in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition is a clinically active therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). A phase 2 trial was conducted in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable stage IV MM who were randomized to temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 5) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15) every 28 days (Regimen TB) or nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2) , or 80 mg/m(2) post-addendum 5 secondary to toxicity, on days 1, 8, and 15), bevacizumab (10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15), and carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 6 on day 1, or AUC 5 post-addendum 5) every 28 days (Regimen ABC). Accrual goal was 41 patients per regimen. The primary aim of this study was to estimate progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) in each regimen. A regimen would be considered promising if its PFS6 rate was > 60%. Ninety-three eligible patients (42 TB and 51 ABC) were enrolled. The majority of patients had M1c disease (20 TB and 26 ABC). The median PFS and overall survival times with ABC were 6.7 months and 13.9 months, respectively. Median PFS time and median overall survival with TB were 3.8 months and 12.3 months, respectively. The most common severe toxicities (≥ grade 3) in both regimens were cytopenias, fatigue, and thrombosis. Among the first 41 patients enrolled onto each regimen, PFS6 rate was 32.8% (95% confidence interval: 21.1%-51.2%) for TB and 56.1% (90% confidence interval: 44.7%-70.4%) for ABC.

"Phase III noninferiority trial comparing irinotecan with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma previously treated with fluorouracil: N9841. The primary goal of this multicenter phase III trial was to determine whether overall survival (OS) of fluorouracil (FU) -refractory patients was noninferior when treated with second-line infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4; arm B) versus irinotecan (arm A). Cross-over to the other treatment on disease progression was mandated. Patients who experienced treatment failure with one prior FU-based therapy and had not received prior irinotecan or oxaliplatin, either for metastatic disease or within 6 months of adjuvant FU therapy, were randomly assigned to arm A (irinotecan 350 or 300 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) or arm B (FOLFOX4). A total of 491 patients were randomly assigned (arm A, n = 245; arm B, n = 246); 288 (59%) had experienced treatment failure with FU for metastatic colorectal cancer. Two hundred twenty-seven patients (46%) received protocol-mandated third-line therapy (arm A, 43%; arm B, 57%). Median survival was 13.8 months (95% CI, 12.2 to 15.0 months) for initial treatment with FOLFOX4 and 14.3 months (95% CI, 12.0 to 15.9 months) for irinotecan (P = .38; hazard ratio = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.1). Response rates (RR; 28% v 15.5%; P = .0009) and time to progression (TTP; 6.2 v 4.4 months; P = .0009) were significantly superior with FOLFOX4. In the nonrandom subset of patients who crossed over, RR and TTP improvements with FOLFOX4 continued into third-line treatment. Irinotecan therapy was associated with more grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia; FOLFOX4 was associated with more neutropenia and paresthesias. In patients who experienced treatment failure with front-line FU therapy, OS does not significantly differ whether second-line therapy begins with irinotecan or FOLFOX4. FOLFOX4 produces higher RR and longer TTP.

"Perioperative Nivolumab and Chemotherapy in Stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Approximately 20% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receive a diagnosis of stage III disease. There is no current consensus regarding the most appropriate treatment for these patients. In this open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned patients with resectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC to receive neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (experimental group) or chemotherapy alone (control group), followed by surgery. Patients in the experimental group who had R0 resections received adjuvant treatment with nivolumab for 6 months. The primary end point was a pathological complete response (0% viable tumor in resected lung and lymph nodes). Secondary end points included progression-free survival and overall survival at 24 months and safety. A total of 86 patients underwent randomization; 57 were assigned to the experimental group and 29 were assigned to the control group. A pathological complete response occurred in 37% of the patients in the experimental group and in 7% in the control group (relative risk, 5.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34 to 21.23; P = 0.02). Surgery was performed in 93% of the patients in the experimental group and in 69% in the control group (relative risk, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.74). Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 67.2% in the experimental group and 40.9% in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression, disease recurrence, or death, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.88). Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 24 months were 85.0% in the experimental group and 63.6% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.98). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 11 patients in the experimental group (19%; some patients had events of both grades) and 3 patients in the control group (10%). In patients with resectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, perioperative treatment with nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in a higher percentage of patients with a pathological complete response and longer survival than chemotherapy alone.

"Ribociclib plus Endocrine Therapy in Early Breast Cancer. Ribociclib has been shown to have a significant overall survival benefit in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. Whether this benefit in advanced breast cancer extends to early breast cancer is unclear. In this international, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive ribociclib (at a dose of 400 mg per day for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off, for 3 years) plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI; letrozole at a dose of 2.5 mg per day or anastrozole at a dose of 1 mg per day for ≥5 years) or an NSAI alone. Premenopausal women and men also received goserelin every 28 days. Eligible patients had anatomical stage II or III breast cancer. Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of invasive disease-free survival, the primary end point; other efficacy and safety results are also reported. Invasive disease-free survival was evaluated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The statistical comparison was made with the use of a stratified log-rank test, with a protocol-specified stopping boundary of a one-sided P-value threshold of 0.0128 for superior efficacy. As of the data-cutoff date for this prespecified interim analysis (January 11, 2023), a total of 426 patients had had invasive disease, recurrence, or death. A significant invasive disease-free survival benefit was seen with ribociclib plus an NSAI as compared with an NSAI alone. At 3 years, invasive disease-free survival was 90.4% with ribociclib plus an NSAI and 87.1% with an NSAI alone (hazard ratio for invasive disease, recurrence, or death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.91; P = 0.003). Secondary end points - distant disease-free survival and recurrence-free survival - also favored ribociclib plus an NSAI. The 3-year regimen of ribociclib at a 400-mg starting dose plus an NSAI was not associated with any new safety signals. Ribociclib plus an NSAI significantly improved invasive disease-free survival among patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative stage II or III early breast cancer.

"Gemcitabine plus vinorelbine compared with cisplatin plus vinorelbine or cisplatin plus gemcitabine for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase III trial of the Italian GEMVIN Investigators and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. Platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens are the standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although toxicity is common and may significantly affect the patient's quality of life (QoL). This trial aimed to assess whether a combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine had benefits in terms of QoL, without influencing negatively on survival, compared with cisplatin-containing regimens. Patients with stage IIIB (effusion and supraclavicular nodes) or IV documented NSCLC who were younger than 70 years of age were randomly assigned gemcitabine plus vinorelbine (GemVin) or either gemcitabine plus cisplatin or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (cisplatin-based). European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer scales were used for QoL analysis. Five hundred one patients were randomly assigned to treatment. The median age was 62 years. There were no significant differences in global QoL scores between the two arms after 2 months of treatment. However, worsening scores for appetite, vomiting, and alopecia were significantly more common in the cisplatin-based arm. Median survival was 38 v 32 weeks and median progression-free survival was 23 v 17 weeks in the cisplatin-based versus GemVin arms, respectively. For the GemVin arm the hazard ratio for death was 1.15 (90% confidence interval [CI], 0.96 to 1.37) and the hazard ratio for progression was 1.29 (90% CI, 1.10 to 1.52). Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, vomiting, alopecia, and ototoxicity were significantly more frequent with cisplatin-based treatment.

"Erlotinib in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib prolongs survival in non-small-cell lung cancer after the failure of first-line or second-line chemotherapy. Patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer, with performance status from 0 to 3, were eligible if they had received one or two prior chemotherapy regimens. The patients were stratified according to center, performance status, response to prior chemotherapy, number of prior regimens, and prior platinum-based therapy and were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib, at a dose of 150 mg daily, or placebo. The median age of the 731 patients who underwent randomization was 61.4 years; 49 percent had received two prior chemotherapy regimens, and 93 percent had received platinum-based chemotherapy. The response rate was 8.9 percent in the erlotinib group and less than 1 percent in the placebo group (P<0.001); the median duration of the response was 7.9 months and 3.7 months, respectively. Progression-free survival was 2.2 months and 1.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.61, adjusted for stratification categories; P<0.001).

"Short-Course Radiation plus Temozolomide in Elderly Patients with Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis in the elderly. Survival has been shown to increase among patients 70 years of age or younger when temozolomide chemotherapy is added to standard radiotherapy (60 Gy over a period of 6 weeks). In elderly patients, more convenient shorter courses of radiotherapy are commonly used, but the benefit of adding temozolomide to a shorter course of radiotherapy is unknown. We conducted a trial involving patients 65 years of age or older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either radiotherapy alone (40 Gy in 15 fractions) or radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. A total of 562 patients underwent randomization, 281 to each group. The median age was 73 years (range, 65 to 90). The median overall survival was longer with radiotherapy plus temozolomide than with radiotherapy alone (9.3 months vs. 7.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.80; P<0.001), as was the median progression-free survival (5.3 months vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.60; P<0.001). Among 165 patients with methylated O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, the median overall survival was 13.5 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 7.7 months with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.73; P<0.001). Among 189 patients with unmethylated MGMT status, the median overall survival was 10.0 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 7.9 months with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.01; P=0.055; P=0.08 for interaction). Quality of life was similar in the two trial groups. In elderly patients with glioblastoma, the addition of temozolomide to short-course radiotherapy resulted in longer survival than short-course radiotherapy alone.

"Randomized comparison of gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin versus dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin chemotherapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory aggressive lymphomas: NCIC-CTG LY.12. For patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma, we hypothesized that gemcitabine-based therapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is as effective as and less toxic than standard treatment. We randomly assigned 619 patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma to treatment with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) or to dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP). Patients with B-cell lymphoma also received rituximab. Responding patients proceeded to stem-cell collection and ASCT. Coprimary end points were response rate after two treatment cycles and transplantation rate. The noninferiority margin for the response rate to GDP relative to DHAP was set at 10%. Secondary end points included event-free and overall survival, treatment toxicity, and quality of life. For the intention-to-treat population, the response rate with GDP was 45.2%; with DHAP the response rate was 44.0% (95% CI for difference, -9.0% to 6.7%), meeting protocol-defined criteria for noninferiority of GDP (P = .005). Similar results were obtained in a per-protocol analysis. The transplantation rates were 52.1% with GDP and 49.3% with DHAP (P = .44). At a median follow-up of 53 months, no differences were detected in event-free survival (HR, 0.99; stratified log-rank P = .95) or overall survival (HR, 1.03; P = .78) between GDP and DHAP. Treatment with GDP was associated with less toxicity (P < .001) and need for hospitalization (P < .001), and preserved quality of life (P = .04).

"A randomized placebo-controlled study of tamoxifen after adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women with early breast cancer (National Cancer Institute of Canada--Clinical Trials Group Trial, MA.12). In the early 1990s, the role of adjuvant tamoxifen in premenopausal women with early breast cancer (EBC) was not established. Similarly, optimum timing relative to adjuvant chemotherapy and efficacy of tamoxifen in hormone receptor-negative tumors were unclear. Premenopausal women with EBC, any hormone receptor status, after surgery received standard adjuvant chemotherapy [doxorubicin (adriamycin)/cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil, or cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/5-fluorouracil] followed by randomization to tamoxifen or placebo for 5 years. Outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), toxicity, and compliance with therapy. Median follow-up for 672 women was 9.7 years. Multivariate analysis showed improved DFS [78.2% versus 71.3% at 5 years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.77; P = 0.056] and a trend for improved OS (86.6% versus 82.1% at 5 years; HR 0.78; P = 0.12). There was no evidence of greater benefit for the receptor-positive subgroup. Compliance with treatment was suboptimal in both arms, with 103 (31%) women on tamoxifen and 70 (21%) on placebo-stopping therapy early because of toxicity, refusal, or other choices. Adjuvant tamoxifen, given after chemotherapy to premenopausal women with EBC, improved 5-year DFS.

"Cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and Fluorouracil versus dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by Paclitaxel versus Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by Paclitaxel in node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer. PURPOSE Cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF) and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel (T) are commonly used adjuvant regimens in women with early breast cancer. In a previous trial in women with locally advanced breast cancer, 3 months of high-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) administered every 2 weeks (dose-dense) was equivalent to 6 months of CEF. We hypothesized that 3 months of paclitaxel after dose-dense EC (EC/T) would be superior to CEF or AC/T. METHODS After lumpectomy or mastectomy, women 60 years of age or younger with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive CEF, EC/T, or AC/T for 6 months. This article reports the interim analysis for recurrence-free survival (RFS), which was planned after 227 recurrences. Results A total of 2,104 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up is 30.4 months. Hazard ratios for recurrence are as follows: AC/T versus CEF, 1.49 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.99), P = .005; AC/T versus EC/T, 1.68 (95% CI, 1.25 to 2.27), P = .0006; and EC/T versus CEF, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.64 to 1.22), P = .46. Three-year RFS rates for CEF, EC/T, and AC/T are 90.1%, 89.5%, and 85.0%, respectively. There was more febrile neutropenia with CEF (22.3%) and EC/T (16.4%) compared with AC/T (4.8%), but more neuropathy with the last two regimens. CONCLUSION Three-weekly AC/T is significantly inferior to CEF or EC/T in terms of RFS.

"Lapatinib or Trastuzumab Plus Taxane Therapy for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer: Final Results of NCIC CTG MA.31. The efficacy of lapatinib versus trastuzumab combined with taxanes in the first-line setting of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive metastatic breast cancer (BC) is unknown. The MA.31 trial compared a combination of first-line anti-HER2 therapy (lapatinib or trastuzumab) and taxane therapy for 24 weeks, followed by the same anti-HER2 monotherapy until progression. Stratification was by prior (neo)adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy, prior (neo)adjuvant taxane, planned taxane, and liver metastases. The primary end point was intention-to-treat (ITT) progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from random assignment to progression by RECIST (version 1.0) criteria, or death for patients with locally assessed HER2-positive tumors. The primary test statistic was a stratified log-rank test for noninferiority. PFS was also assessed for patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive tumors. From July 17, 2008, to December 1, 2011, 652 patients were accrued from 21 countries, resulting in 537 patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive tumors. Median follow-up was 21.5 months. Median ITT PFS was 9.0 months with lapatinib and 11.3 months with trastuzumab. By ITT analysis, PFS was inferior for lapatinib compared with trastuzumab, with a stratified hazard ratio (HR) of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.65; P = .001). In patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive tumors, median PFS was 9.1 months with lapatinib and 13.6 months with trastuzumab (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.83; P < .001).

"Erlotinib plus gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: a phase III trial of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis and there have been no improvements in survival since the introduction of gemcitabine in 1996. Pancreatic tumors often overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (HER1/EGFR) and this is associated with a worse prognosis. We studied the effects of adding the HER1/EGFR-targeted agent erlotinib to gemcitabine in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive standard gemcitabine plus erlotinib (100 or 150 mg/d orally) or gemcitabine plus placebo in a double-blind, international phase III trial. The primary end point was overall survival. A total of 569 patients were randomly assigned. Overall survival based on an intent-to-treat analysis was significantly prolonged on the erlotinib/gemcitabine arm with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P = .038, adjusted for stratification factors; median 6.24 months v 5.91 months). One-year survival was also greater with erlotinib plus gemcitabine (23% v 17%; P = .023). Progression-free survival was significantly longer with erlotinib plus gemcitabine with an estimated HR of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.92; P = .004). Objective response rates were not significantly different between the arms, although more patients on erlotinib had disease stabilization. There was a higher incidence of some adverse events with erlotinib plus gemcitabine, but most were grade 1 or 2. To our knowledge, this randomized phase III trial is the first to demonstrate statistically significantly improved survival in advanced pancreatic cancer by adding any agent to gemcitabine.

"Combined androgen deprivation therapy and radiation therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: a randomised, phase 3 trial. Whether the addition of radiation therapy (RT) improves overall survival in men with locally advanced prostate cancer managed with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is unclear. Our aim was to compare outcomes in such patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Patients with: locally advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer (n=1057); or organ-confined disease (T2) with either a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration more than 40 ng/mL (n=119) or PSA concentration more than 20 ng/mL and a Gleason score of 8 or higher (n=25), were randomly assigned (done centrally with stratification and dynamic minimisation, not masked) to receive lifelong ADT and RT (65-69 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, 45 Gy to the pelvic nodes). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The results presented here are of an interim analysis planned for when two-thirds of the events for the final analysis were recorded. All efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and were based on data from all patients. This trial is registered at controlledtrials.com as ISRCTN24991896 and Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00002633. Between 1995 and 2005, 1205 patients were randomly assigned (602 in the ADT only group and 603 in the ADT and RT group); median follow-up was 6·0 years (IQR 4·4-8·0). At the time of analysis, a total of 320 patients had died, 175 in the ADT only group and 145 in the ADT and RT group. The addition of RT to ADT improved overall survival at 7 years (74%, 95% CI 70-78 vs 66%, 60-70; hazard ratio [HR] 0·77, 95% CI 0·61-0·98, p=0·033). Both toxicity and health-related quality-of-life results showed a small effect of RT on late gastrointestinal toxicity (rectal bleeding grade >3, three patients (0·5%) in the ADT only group, two (0·3%) in the ADT and RT group; diarrhoea grade >3, four patients (0·7%) vs eight (1·3%); urinary toxicity grade >3, 14 patients (2·3%) in both groups).

"Intermittent androgen suppression for rising PSA level after radiotherapy. Intermittent androgen deprivation for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation after radiotherapy may improve quality of life and delay hormone resistance. We assessed overall survival with intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation in a noninferiority randomized trial. We enrolled patients with a PSA level greater than 3 ng per milliliter more than 1 year after primary or salvage radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Intermittent treatment was provided in 8-month cycles, with nontreatment periods determined according to the PSA level. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included quality of life, time to castration-resistant disease, and duration of nontreatment intervals. Of 1386 enrolled patients, 690 were randomly assigned to intermittent therapy and 696 to continuous therapy. Median follow-up was 6.9 years. There were no significant between-group differences in adverse events. In the intermittent-therapy group, full testosterone recovery occurred in 35% of patients, and testosterone recovery to the trial-entry threshold occurred in 79%. Intermittent therapy provided potential benefits with respect to physical function, fatigue, urinary problems, hot flashes, libido, and erectile function. There were 268 deaths in the intermittent-therapy group and 256 in the continuous-therapy group. Median overall survival was 8.8 years in the intermittent-therapy group versus 9.1 years in the continuous-therapy group (hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.21). The estimated 7-year cumulative rates of disease-related death were 18% and 15% in the two groups, respectively (P=0.24). Intermittent androgen deprivation was noninferior to continuous therapy with respect to overall survival. Some quality-of-life factors improved with intermittent therapy.

"Polychemotherapy for early breast cancer: results from the international adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy randomized trial. Survival of patients with early-stage breast cancer is improved following treatment with single-modality tamoxifen, ovarian ablation or suppression, or chemotherapy. The Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials were designed to ascertain any additional benefits of combined treatment. The Adjuvant Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Trial was a randomized phase III trial in which patients with early-stage breast cancer who were receiving prolonged (5 years) tamoxifen treatment, with or without ovarian ablation or suppression, were randomly assigned to standard chemotherapy versus none. Trial endpoints included relapse-free and overall survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) were derived from Cox models, and all statistical tests were two-sided. Between 1992 and 2000, 1991 patients between the ages of 26 and 81 years were randomly assigned (987 to chemotherapy, 1004 to no chemotherapy) from 106 UK and 16 non-UK centers. Nine hundred seven (92%) patients received chemotherapy as allocated (87% received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil; 11% received anthracycline-containing regimens). A total of 244 of the 619 premenopausal patients received elective ovarian ablation or suppression. Chemotherapy improved relapse-free survival (relapse in the chemotherapy group versus no-chemotherapy group, 298 events versus 332 events, HR = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73 to 1.01; P = .06) and overall survival (death from any cause in the chemotherapy group versus no-chemotherapy group, 243 events versus 282 events, HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.99; P = .03) after adjustment for nodal status, estrogen receptor status, and age. Subgroup analyses showed that the benefit of chemotherapy was greatest in younger women (<50 years) and in particular for premenopausal women not receiving ovarian ablation or suppression. Modest yet sustainable benefits for chemoendocrine therapy occur in women with breast cancer.

"Addition of bortezomib to standard dose chop chemotherapy improves response and survival in relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. The proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, potentially increases cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. This study was performed to determine the overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) compared to CHOP + bortezomib chemotherapy in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients at first relapse. Forty-six patients were randomly assigned to standard dose CHOP ± bortezomib 1·6 mg/m(2) given on a 21-d cycle for up to eight cycles of treatment. Median age was 71 years (CHOP arm) and 69 years (CHOP-bortezomib arm). Median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 (CHOP) and 0 (CHOP-bortezomib) with 65% and 52%, respectively, having a disease stage of IV. ORR was 47·8% (CHOP) and 82·6% (CHOP-bortezomib). Complete response rate was 21·7% (CHOP) vs. 34·8% (CHOP-bortezomib); partial response rate was 26·1% (CHOP) vs. 47·8% (CHOP-bortezomib). Median OS was 11·8 months (CHOP) and 35·6 months (CHOP-bortezomib) (P = 0·01, Hazard ratio [HR] 0·37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·16-0·83)] and there was a non-significant improvement in PFS: 8·1 months (CHOP) and 16·5 months (CHOP-bortezomib) [P = 0·12, HR 0·60 (95% CI 0·31-1·15)]. Severe (≥grade 3) sensory neuropathy was similar in both arms (4·3% CHOP vs. 6·5% CHOP-bortezomib).

"NEPTUNE: Phase 3 Study of First-Line Durvalumab Plus Tremelimumab in Patients With Metastatic NSCLC. NEPTUNE, a phase 3, open-label study, evaluated first-line durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC). Eligible patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type mNSCLC were randomized (1:1) to first-line durvalumab (20 mg/kg every 4 weeks until progression) plus tremelimumab (1 mg/kg every 4 weeks for up to four doses) or standard chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by tumor programmed death-ligand 1 expression (≥25% versus <25%), tumor histologic type, and smoking history. The amended primary end point was overall survival (OS) in patients with blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) greater than or equal to 20 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with bTMB greater than or equal to 20 mut/Mb and safety and tolerability in all treated patients. As of June 24, 2019, 823 patients were randomized (intention-to-treat [ITT]); 512 (62%) were bTMB-evaluable, with 129 of 512 (25%) having bTMB greater than or equal to 20 mut/Mb (durvalumab plus tremelimumab [n = 69]; chemotherapy [n = 60]). Baseline characteristics were balanced in the intention-to-treat. Among patients with bTMB greater than or equal to 20 mut/Mb, OS improvement with durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy did not reach statistical significance (hazard ratio 0.71 [95% confidence interval: 0.49-1.05; p = 0.081]; median OS, 11.7 versus 9.1 months); the hazard ratio for PFS was 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.15; median PFS, 4.2 versus 5.1 months).

"Anthracycline dose optimisation in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial. Anthracycline dose optimisation in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has rarely been tested. We aimed to find out whether R-CEOP70 was non-inferior to R-CHOP50 with less cardiotoxicity, and whether R-CEOP90 had a superior efficacy to R-CHOP50 or R-CEOP70 with acceptable toxic effects. In this multicentre, phase 3, randomised, controlled study (NHL-001), patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma grade 3B were enrolled from 20 centres of the Multicenter Hematology-Oncology Programs Evaluation System in China. Young patients (16-60 years) were randomly assigned 1:1:1 (block size of six) to six courses of R-CHOP50, R-CEOP70, or R-CEOP90, and older patients (61-80 years) were assigned 1:1 (block size of four) to R-CHOP50 or R-CEOP70. Patients were randomly assigned using computer-assisted permuted-block randomisation. Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment assignment. In the R-CHOP50 group, patients were given rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 0, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, doxorubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and vincristine 1·4 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum dose 2 mg) intravenously on day 1, and prednisone 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum dose 100 mg) orally from day 1-5; in the R-CEOP70 group, epirubicin 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> replaced doxorubicin; and in the R-CEOP90 group, high dose epirubicin 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> replaced doxorubicin. All patients received two additional courses of rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every 21 days. Consolidation radiotherapy was given to patients with bulky disease at diagnosis or residual disease at the end of treatment. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival. The non-inferiority margin for R-CEOP70 versus R-CHOP50 was defined by hazard ratio [HR] as the upper limit of its 95% CI being no greater than 1·50. Analysis of efficacy and safety were of the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01852435. From May 15, 2013, to March 16, 2016, a total of 648 patients were enrolled, including 404 (62%) young patients (R-CHOP50 [n=135], R-CEOP70 [n=134], or R-CEOP90 [n=135]), and 244 (38%) older patients (R-CHOP50 [n=122] or R-CEOP70 [n=122]). Four patients were excluded from the study for consent withdrawal and one patient for misdiagnosis before treatment. The 2-year progression-free survival in the R-CHOP50 group was 72·5% (95% CI 66·6-77·6) and in the R-CEOP70 group was 72·4% ([66·5-77·5]; HR 1·00 [0·73-1·38]; p=0·99). The non-inferiority was met and adverse events were similar between the two groups. Fewer patients in the R-CEOP70 group (14 [13%] of 110) presented with over 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than those in the R-CHOP50 group (31 [29%] of 108) at 3 years after remission. For young patients, the 2-year progression-free survival in the R-CEOP90 group was 88·8% (82·1-93·1) and was significantly improved compared with the R-CHOP50 group (75·9% [67·7-82·3]; 0·44 [0·25-0·76]; p=0·0047) and the R-CEOP70 group (77·4% [69·4-83·7%]; 0·49 [0·27-0·86]; p=0·017). Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred more frequently in the R-CEOP90 group (97 [72%] of 134) than in the R-CHOP50 group (87 [65%] of 133) and R-CEOP70 group (84 [63%] of 133) in young patients but without further increase of clinically significant infections. Fewer patients in the R-CEOP70 group (7 [11%] of 66) and in the R-CEOP90 group (10 [13%] of 79) presented with more than 10% decrease in LVEF than those in the R-CHOP50 group (17 [26%] of 66) at 3 years after remission. R-CEOP70 could serve as an alternative regimen to R-CHOP50 with mild long-term cardiotoxicity. Young patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma might benefit from high-dose epirubicin. Epirubicin is an alternative drug to doxorubicin in regular R-CHOP with mild long-term cardiotoxicity.

"Horse versus rabbit antithymocyte globulin in acquired aplastic anemia. In severe acquired aplastic anemia, hematopoietic failure is the result of immune-mediated destruction of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells. Immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus cyclosporine is an effective alternative to stem-cell transplantation and improves blood counts and survival. Although horse ATG is the standard therapy, rabbit ATG is more potent in depleting peripheral-blood lymphocytes and is preferred in other clinical circumstances. From December 2005 through July 2010, we performed a randomized trial comparing these two ATG formulations in conventional regimens. Patients were treated at a single facility. The primary outcome was hematologic response at 6 months, as determined by blood counts. The study was designed to enroll 60 patients each for the rabbit-ATG and horse-ATG groups and was powered to detect a difference of 25 percentage points in the response rate. A large, unexpected difference was observed in the rate of hematologic response at 6 months in favor of horse ATG (68%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 56 to 80) as compared with rabbit ATG (37%; 95% CI, 24 to 49; P<0.001). Overall survival at 3 years also differed, with a survival rate of 96% (95% CI, 90 to 100) in the horse-ATG group as compared with 76% (95% CI, 61 to 95) in the rabbit-ATG group (P=0.04) when data were censored at the time of stem-cell transplantation, and 94% (95% CI, 88 to 100) as compared with 70% (95% CI, 56 to 86; P=0.008) in the respective groups when stem-cell-transplantation events were not censored. In a randomized study, rabbit ATG was inferior to horse ATG as a first treatment for severe aplastic anemia, as indicated by hematologic response and survival.

"Benralizumab for <i>PDGFRA</i>-Negative Hypereosinophilic Syndrome. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a group of diseases defined by marked eosinophilia in blood or tissue and eosinophil-related clinical manifestations. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5 receptor α, which is expressed on human eosinophils. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, we administered a series of three monthly subcutaneous injections of either benralizumab (at a dose of 30 mg) or placebo in 20 symptomatic patients who had <i>PDGFRA</i>-negative hypereosinophilic syndrome and an absolute eosinophil count of at least 1000 cells per cubic millimeter; all the patients were receiving stable therapy (drugs or dietary changes) for this disease. This regimen was followed by an open-label phase, during which the patient's background therapy could be tapered as tolerated, and an extension phase. The primary end point of the randomized phase was a reduction of at least 50% in the absolute eosinophil count at week 12. During the randomized phase, the primary end point occurred in more patients in the benralizumab group than in the placebo group (9 of 10 patients [90%] vs. 3 of 10 patients [30%], P = 0.02). During the open-label phase, clinical and hematologic responses were observed in 17 of 19 patients (89%) and were sustained for 48 weeks in 14 of 19 patients (74%); in the latter group, in 9 of 14 patients (64%), background therapies could be tapered. Bone marrow and tissue eosinophilia were also suppressed with benralizumab therapy. The most common drug-related adverse events, headache and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, occurred in 32% of the patients after the first dose of benralizumab and resolved within 48 hours in all patients. Other adverse events occurred with similar frequency in the two groups. Of the many potential predictors of response that were examined, only clinical disease subtype appeared to be associated with the initial response or relapse. In this small phase 2 trial, patients with <i>PDGFRA</i>-negative hypereosinophilic syndrome who received benralizumab for 12 weeks had lower absolute eosinophil counts than those who received placebo. During the open-label phase, clinical and hematologic responses were sustained for 48 weeks in 74% of the patients. Adverse events did not limit treatment.

We report the primary analysis and 4-year follow-up of the NIBIT-M2 study, the first phase III trial comparing these regimens with fotemustine in patients with melanoma with brain metastases. This phase III study recruited patients 18 years of age and older with <i>BRAF</i> wild-type or mutant melanoma, and active, untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases from nine centers, randomized (1:1:1) to fotemustine, ipilimumab plus fotemustine, or ipilimumab plus nivolumab. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). From January, 2013 to September, 2018, 27, 26, and 27 patients received fotemustine, ipilimumab plus fotemustine, and ipilimumab plus nivolumab. Median OS was 8.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8-12.2] in the fotemustine arm, 8.2 months (95% CI, 2.2-14.3) in the ipilimumab plus fotemustine arm (HR vs. fotemustine, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.59-1.99; <i>P</i> = 0.78), and 29.2 months (95% CI, 0-65.1) in the ipilimumab plus nivolumab arm (HR vs. fotemustine, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.87; <i>P</i> = 0.017).

"Liposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and leucovorin versus fluorouracil and leucovorin for metastatic biliary tract cancer after progression on gemcitabine plus cisplatin (NIFTY): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2b study. The prognosis of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer who have progressed on gemcitabine plus cisplatin is dismal. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of second-line liposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with metastatic biliary tract cancer that has progressed on gemcitabine plus cisplatin. This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2b (NIFTY) study was done at five academic institutions in South Korea and included patients aged 19 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic biliary tract cancer that had progressed on first-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. By use of an interactive web-based response system integrated with an electronic data capture system, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted blocks (block size 4) to receive either intravenous liposomal irinotecan (70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 90 min) plus intravenous leucovorin (400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 30 min) and intravenous fluorouracil (2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 46 h) every 2 weeks or leucovorin and fluorouracil only every 2 weeks, and were stratified by primary tumour site, previous surgery with curative intent, and participating centre. Study treatment was continued until the patient had disease progression or unacceptable toxicities, or withdrew consent. The primary endpoint was blinded independent central review (BICR)-assessed progression-free survival. The primary endpoint and safety were assessed in the full analysis set and the safety analysis set, respectively, both of which comprised all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03524508, and enrolment is complete. Between Sept 5, 2018, and Feb 18, 2020, 193 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 174 (88 in the liposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and leucovorin group and 86 in the fluorouracil plus leucovorin group) were enrolled and included in the full analysis and safety analysis sets. At a median follow-up of 11·8 months (IQR 7·7-18·7), the median BICR-assessed progression-free survival was significantly longer in the liposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and leucovorin group (7·1 months, 95% CI 3·6-8·8) than in the fluorouracil and leucovorin group (1·4 months, 1·2-1·5; hazard ratio 0·56, 95% CI 0·39-0·81; p=0·0019). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (21 [24%] of 88 in the liposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and leucovorin group vs one [1%] of 86 in the fluorouracil and leucovorin group) and fatigue or asthenia (11 [13%] vs three [3%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 37 (42%) patients receiving liposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and leucovorin and 21 (24%) patients receiving fluorouracil and leucovorin. There were no treatment-related deaths. Adding liposomal irinotecan to fluorouracil and leucovorin significantly improved BICR-assessed progression-free survival in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. Liposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and leucovorin could be considered a standard-of-care second-line therapy for advanced biliary tract cancer. Servier and HK inno.

"Induction therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous stem cell transplantation versus autologous stem cell transplantation alone in the treatment of renal AL amyloidosis: a randomized controlled trial. Although the use of bortezomib alone and in combination with steroids has shown efficacy in AL amyloidosis, its role in combination with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT) is unknown. In this study, we evaluated bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone (BD) for induction chemotherapy prior to HDM/SCT. This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing induction therapy consisting of two BD cycles followed by HDM/SCT (BD + HDM/SCT) with HDM/SCT alone in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis. The hematological and organ responses of the patients were assessed every three months post HDM/SCT. Fifty-six patients newly diagnosed with renal (100%), cardiac (57.1%), liver (7.1%), or nervous system (8.9%) AL amyloidosis were enrolled in this study; 28 patients were assigned to each arm. Two patients died within 100 days of HDM/SCT (3.6% treatment-related mortality). The overall hematologic response rates in the BD + HDM/SCT arm and HDM/SCT arm at three, six and twelve months were 78.5% versus 50%, 82.1% versus 53.5% and 85.7% versus 53.5%, respectively. In the BD + HDM/SCT arm, 15 (53.5%) patients achieved a hematologic response after BD and before HDM/SCT. An intention-to-treat analysis revealed a higher rate of complete remission in the BD + HDM/SCT arm at both 12 and 24 months (67.9% and 70%, respectively) than with the HDM/SCT-only therapy (35.7% and 35%, respectively, P = 0.03). After a median follow-up of 28 months, the survival rates at 24 months post-treatment start were 95.0% in the BD + HDM/SCT group and 69.4% in the HDM/SCT alone group (P = 0.03). Our preliminary data suggest that the outcome of treating AL amyloidosis with BD induction and HDM/SCT was superior to the outcome of the HDM/SCT treatment alone.

"High-dose tamoxifen in the treatment of inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicenter randomized controlled trial. In the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere, almost 85% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are inoperable at diagnosis and have a dismal prognosis. Tamoxifen (TMX) is believed to inhibit HCC positive for estrogen receptor (ER), but most HCCs are ER negative. Results of previous phase 3 trials in inoperable HCC have been conflicting and inconclusive. At higher doses, however, TMX inhibits HCC through ER-independent mechanisms. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed to assess the role of high-dose TMX versus placebo (P) in the treatment of patients with inoperable HCC with respect to survival and quality of life (QoL). A total of 329 patients from 10 centers in 9 countries in the Asia-Pacific region enrolled in a double-blind randomized controlled trial of TMX 120 mg/d (TMX120) against P as a control arm with an intermediate dosage of TMX 60 mg/d (TMX60) to assess possible dose response. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed all aspects of the trial. QoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Three-month survival rates for the P, TMX60, and TMX120 groups were 44%, 41%, and 35%, respectively, with a statistically significant trend difference in survival across the 3 treatment regimens (P =.011). There was a significantly higher risk of death in the TMX120 group compared with the P group (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.81). Adverse drug reactions were reported in 3% (9 patients), and 8 patients were lost to follow-up. In conclusion, TMX does not prolong survival in patients with inoperable HCC and has an increasingly negative impact with increasing dose. No appreciable advantage to QoL with TMX was observed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12395333/,12395333,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy compared to Placebo when used to treat Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy and Placebo for managing Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy when compared with Placebo for Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy in comparison to Placebo for the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy compared to Placebo for addressing Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy and Placebo in the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy against Placebo for managing Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy compared to Placebo in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy contrasted with Placebo in relation to Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy versus Placebo for treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy and Placebo in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy as opposed to Placebo in managing Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy compared to Placebo in the context of Hepatocellular carcinoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how Tamoxifen monotherapy compares to Placebo in terms of effectiveness for Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy in relation to Placebo for the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Tamoxifen monotherapy versus Placebo for managing Hepatocellular carcinoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Tamoxifen monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Placebo in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Tamoxifen monotherapy against Placebo regarding Hepatocellular carcinoma.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00003424,"{""12395333"": ""Pierce K h Chow|Bee-Choo Tai|Chee-Kiat Tan|David Machin|Khin Maung Win|Phillip J Johnson|Khee-Chee Soo|Asian-Pacific Hepatocellular Carcinoma Trials Group""}",1997-04,No,No,Unknown,Unknown
"Bortezomib consolidation after autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma: a Nordic Myeloma Study Group randomized phase 3 trial. The Nordic Myeloma Study Group conducted an open randomized trial to compare bortezomib as consolidation therapy given after high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with no consolidation in bortezomib-naive patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Overall, 370 patients were centrally randomly assigned 3 months after ASCT to receive 20 doses of bortezomib given during 21 weeks or no consolidation. The hypothesis was that consolidation therapy would prolong progression-free survival (PFS). The PFS after randomization was 27 months for the bortezomib group compared with 20 months for the control group (P = .05). Fifty-one of 90 patients in the treatment group compared with 32 of 90 controls improved their response after randomization (P = .007). No difference in overall survival was seen. Fatigue was reported more commonly by the bortezomib-treated patients in self-reported quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires, whereas no other major differences in QOL were recorded between the groups. Consolidation therapy seemed to be beneficial for patients not achieving at least a very good partial response (VGPR) but not for patients in the ≥ VGPR category at randomization. Consolidation with bortezomib after ASCT in bortezomib-naive patients improves PFS without interfering with QOL.

"Temozolomide chemotherapy alone versus radiotherapy alone for malignant astrocytoma in the elderly: the NOA-08 randomised, phase 3 trial. Radiotherapy is the standard care in elderly patients with malignant astrocytoma and the role of primary chemotherapy is poorly defined. We did a randomised trial to compare the efficacy and safety of dose-dense temozolomide alone versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. Between May 15, 2005, and Nov 2, 2009, we enrolled patients with confirmed anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma, age older than 65 years, and a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or higher. Patients were randomly assigned 100 mg/m(2) temozolomide, given on days 1-7 of 1 week on, 1 week off cycles, or radiotherapy of 60·0 Gy, administered over 6-7 weeks in 30 fractions of 1·8-2·0 Gy. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We assessed non-inferiority with a 25% margin, analysed for all patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01502241. Of 584 patients screened, we enrolled 412. 373 patients (195 randomly allocated to the temozolomide group and 178 to the radiotherapy group) received at least one dose of treatment and were included in efficacy analyses. Median overall survival was 8·6 months (95% CI 7·3-10·2) in the temozolomide group versus 9·6 months (8·2-10·8) in the radiotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·09, 95% CI 0·84-1·42, p(non-inferiority)=0·033). Median event-free survival (EFS) did not differ significantly between the temozolomide and radiotherapy groups (3·3 months [95% CI 3·2-4·1] vs 4·7 [4·2-5·2]; HR 1·15, 95% CI 0·92-1·43, p(non-inferiority)=0·043). Tumour MGMT promoter methylation was seen in 73 (35%) of 209 patients tested. MGMT promoter methylation was associated with longer overall survival than was unmethylated status (11·9 months [95% CI 9·0 to not reached] vs 8·2 months [7·0-10·0]; HR 0·62, 95% CI 0·42-0·91, p=0·014). EFS was longer in patients with MGMT promoter methylation who received temozolomide than in those who underwent radiotherapy (8·4 months [95e% CI 5·5-11·7] vs 4·6 [4·2-5·0]), whereas the opposite was true for patients with no methylation of the MGMT promoter (3·3 months [3·0-3·5] vs 4·6 months [3·7-6·3]). The most frequent grade 3-4 intervention-related adverse events were neutropenia (16 patients in the temozolomide group vs two in the radiotherapy group), lymphocytopenia (46 vs one), thrombocytopenia (14 vs four), raised liver-enzyme concentrations (30 vs 16), infections (35 vs 23), and thromboembolic events (24 vs eight). Temozolomide alone is non-inferior to radiotherapy alone in the treatment of elderly patients with malignant astrocytoma. MGMT promoter methylation seems to be a useful biomarker for outcomes by treatment and could aid decision-making.

"Niraparib maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer using an individualized starting dose (NORA): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial<sup>☆</sup>. This study evaluated maintenance treatment with niraparib, a potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2, in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. In this phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 30 centers in China, adults with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who had responded to their most recent platinum-containing chemotherapy were randomized 2 : 1 to receive oral niraparib (300 mg/day) or matched placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (NCT03705156). Following a protocol amendment, patients with a bodyweight <77 kg or a platelet count <150 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μl received 200 mg/day, and all other patients 300 mg/day, as an individualized starting dose (ISD). Randomization was carried out by an interactive web response system and stratified by BRCA mutation, time to recurrence following penultimate chemotherapy, and response to most recent chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Between 26 September 2017 and 2 February 2019, 265 patients were randomized to receive niraparib (n = 177) or placebo (n = 88); 249 patients received an ISD (300 mg, n = 14; 200 mg, n = 235) as per protocol. In the intention-to-treat population, median PFS was significantly longer for patients receiving niraparib versus placebo: 18.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 10.9-not evaluable] versus 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7-5.7) months [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23-0.45; P < 0.0001], and a similar PFS benefit was observed in patients receiving an ISD, regardless of BRCA mutation status.

"Longer therapy, iatrogenic amenorrhea, and survival in early breast cancer. Chemotherapy regimens that combine anthracyclines and taxanes result in improved disease-free and overall survival among women with operable lymph-node-positive breast cancer. The effectiveness of concurrent versus sequential regimens is not known. We randomly assigned 5351 patients with operable, node-positive, early-stage breast cancer to receive four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (sequential ACT); four cycles of doxorubicin and docetaxel (doxorubicin-docetaxel); or four cycles of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel (concurrent ACT). The primary aims were to examine whether concurrent ACT was more effective than sequential ACT and whether the doxorubicin-docetaxel regimen would be as effective as the concurrent-ACT regimen. The secondary aims were to assess toxic effects and to correlate amenorrhea with outcomes in premenopausal women. At a median follow-up of 73 months, overall survival was improved in the sequential-ACT group (8-year overall survival, 83%) as compared with the doxorubicin-docetaxel group (overall survival, 79%; hazard ratio for death, 0.83; P=0.03) and the concurrent-ACT group (overall survival, 79%; hazard ratio, 0.86; P=0.09). Disease-free survival was improved in the sequential-ACT group (8-year disease-free survival, 74%) as compared with the doxorubicin-docetaxel group (disease-free survival, 69%; hazard ratio for recurrence, a second malignant condition, or death, 0.80; P=0.001) and the concurrent-ACT group (disease-free survival, 69%; hazard ratio, 0.83; P=0.01). The doxorubicin-docetaxel regimen showed noninferiority to the concurrent-ACT regimen for overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.14). Overall survival was improved in patients with amenorrhea for 6 months or more across all treatment groups, independently of estrogen-receptor status. Sequential ACT improved disease-free survival as compared with doxorubicin-docetaxel or concurrent ACT, and it improved overall survival as compared with doxorubicin-docetaxel. Amenorrhea was associated with improved survival regardless of the treatment and estrogen-receptor status.

"Benefit from exemestane as extended adjuvant therapy after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen: intention-to-treat analysis of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast And Bowel Project B-33 trial. Patients with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer have considerable residual risk for recurrence after completing 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. In May 2001, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) initiated accrual to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane as extended adjuvant therapy in this setting. Postmenopausal patients with clinical T(1-3)N(1)M(0) breast cancer who were disease free after 5 years of tamoxifen were randomly assigned to 5 years of exemestane (25 mg/d orally) or 5 years of placebo. Our primary aim was to test whether exemestane prolongs disease-free survival (DFS). In October 2003, results of National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) MA.17 showing benefit from adjuvant letrozole in this setting necessitated termination of accrual to B-33, unblinding, and offering of exemestane to patients in the placebo group. At the time of unblinding, 1,598 patients had been randomly assigned; 72% in the exemestane group continued on exemestane and 44% in the placebo group elected to receive exemestane. With 30 months of median follow-up, original exemestane assignment resulted in a borderline statistically significant improvement in 4-year DFS (91% v 89%; relative risk [RR] = 0.68; P = .07) and in a statistically significant improvement in 4-year relapse-free survival (RFS; 96% v 94%; RR = 0.44; P = .004). Toxicity, assessed up to time of unblinding, was acceptable for the adjuvant setting. Despite premature closure and crossover to exemestane by a substantial proportion of patients, original exemestane assignment resulted in non-statistically significant improvement in DFS and in statistically significant improvement in RFS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18332472/,18332472,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy compared to Placebo when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy and Placebo for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy when compared with Placebo for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy in comparison to Placebo for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy compared to Placebo for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy and Placebo in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy against Placebo for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy compared to Placebo in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy contrasted with Placebo in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy versus Placebo for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy and Placebo in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy as opposed to Placebo in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy compared to Placebo in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Exemestane monotherapy compares to Placebo in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy in relation to Placebo for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Exemestane monotherapy versus Placebo for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Exemestane monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Placebo in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Exemestane monotherapy against Placebo regarding Breast cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00016432,"{""18332472"": ""Eleftherios P Mamounas|Jong-Hyeon Jeong|D Lawrence Wickerham|Roy E Smith|Patricia A Ganz|Stephanie R Land|Andrea Eisen|Louis Fehrenbacher|William B Farrar|James N Atkins|Eduardo R Pajon|Victor G Vogel|Joan F Kroener|Laura F Hutchins|André Robidoux|James L Hoehn|James N Ingle|Charles E Geyer|Joseph P Costantino|Norman Wolmark""}",2001-05,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Unknown
"Lapatinib as a component of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive operable breast cancer (NSABP protocol B-41): an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial. We studied the effect on tumour response to neoadjuvant therapy of the substitution of lapatinib for trastuzumab in combination with weekly paclitaxel after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide treatment, and of the addition of lapatinib and trastuzumab combined after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide treatment in patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer to determine whether there would be a benefit of dual HER2 blockade in these patients. For this open-label, randomised phase 3 trial we recruited women aged 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 with operable HER2-positive breast cancer. Each received four cycles of standard doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks followed by four cycles of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks. Concurrently with weekly paclitaxel, patients received either trastuzumab (4 mg/kg load, then 2 mg/kg intravenously) weekly until surgery, lapatinib (1250 mg orally) daily until surgery, or weekly trastuzumab plus lapatinib (750 mg orally) daily until surgery. After surgery, all patients received trastuzumab to complete 52 weeks of HER2-targeted therapy. Randomisation (ratio 1:1:1) was done centrally with stratification by clinical tumour size, clinical nodal status, hormone-receptor status, and age. The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response in the breast, and analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat population. Patient accrual started on July 16, 2007, and was completed on June 30, 2011; 529 women were enrolled in the trial. 519 patients had their pathological response determined. Breast pathological complete response was noted in 93 (52·5%, 95% CI 44·9-59·5) of 177 patients in the trastuzumab group, 91 (53·2%, 45·4-60·3) of 171 patients in the lapatinib group (p=0·9852); and 106 (62·0%, 54·3-68·8) of 171 patients in the combination group (p=0·095). The most common grade 3 and 4 toxic effects were neutropenia (29 [16%] patients in the trastuzumab group [grade 4 in five patients (3%), 28 [16%] in the lapatinib group [grade 4 in eight patients (5%)], and 29 [17%] in the combination group [grade 4 in nine patients (5%)]) and grade 3 diarrhoea (four [2%] patients in the trastuzumab group, 35 [20%] in the lapatinib group, and 46 [27%] in the combination group; p<0·0001). Symptomatic congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association Class III or IV events occurred in seven (4%) patients in the trastuzumab group, seven (4%) in the lapatinib group, and one (<1%) in the combination group; p=0·185). Substitution of lapatinib for trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy resulted in similar high percentages of pathological complete response. Combined HER2-targeted therapy produced a numerically but insignificantly higher pathological complete response percentage than single-agent HER2-directed therapy; these findings are consistent with results from other studies.

"Use of letrozole after aromatase inhibitor-based therapy in postmenopausal breast cancer (NRG Oncology/NSABP B-42): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. The optimal duration of extended therapy with aromatase inhibitors in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer is unknown. In the NSABP B-42 study, we aimed to determine whether extended letrozole treatment improves disease-free survival after 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy in women with postmenopausal breast cancer. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done in 158 centres in the USA, Canada, and Ireland. Postmenopausal women with stage I-IIIA hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who were disease-free after about 5 years of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 5 years of letrozole (2·5 mg orally per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by pathological node status, previous tamoxifen use, and lowest bone mineral density T score in the lumbosacral spine, total hip, or femoral neck. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, defined as time from randomisation to breast cancer recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death, and was analysed by intention to treat. To adjust for previous interim analyses, the two-sided statistical significance level for disease-free survival was set at 0·0418. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00382070, is active, and is no longer enrolling patients. Between Sept 28, 2006, and Jan 6, 2010, 3966 patients were randomly assigned to receive letrozole (n=1983) or placebo (n=1983). Follow-up information was available for 3903 patients for the analyses of disease-free survival. Median follow-up was 6·9 years (IQR 6·1-7·5). Letrozole treatment did not significantly improve disease-free survival (339 disease-free survival events were reported in the placebo group and 292 disease-free survival events were reported in the letrozole group; hazard ratio 0·85, 95% CI 0·73-0·999; p=0·048). 7-year disease-free survival estimate was 81·3% (95% CI 79·3-83·1) in the placebo group and 84·7% (82·9-86·4) in the letrozole group. The most common grade 3 adverse events were arthralgia (47 [2%] of 1933 patients in the placebo group vs 50 [3%] of 1941 patients in the letrozole group) and back pain (44 [2%] vs 38 [2%]). The most common grade 4 adverse event in the placebo group was thromboembolic event (eight [<1%]) and the most common grade 4 adverse events in the letrozole group were urinary tract infection, hypokalaemia, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (four [<1%] each). After 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy, 5 years of letrozole therapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival compared with placebo.

"Final results of randomized trials by the National Surgical Adjuvant Study of Colorectal Cancer (NSAS-CC). In the latter 1990s, adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected Stage III colorectal cancer remained controversial in Japan. We conducted two independent randomized controlled trials in patients with Stage III colon and rectal cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive surgery alone or surgery followed by treatment with UFT (400 mg/m²/day), given for five consecutive days per week for 1 year. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS), and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A total of 334 patients with colon cancer and 276 with rectal cancer were enrolled. The patients' characteristics were similar between the UFT group and the Surgery-alone group. There was no significant difference in RFS or OS in colon cancer. In rectal cancer, however, RFS and OS were significantly better in the UFT group than in the Surgery-alone group. The only grade 4 toxicity in the UFT group was diarrhea, occurring in one patient with colon cancer and one patient with rectal cancer.

This prospective randomized study compared the survival of patients with tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage T2 N1-2 gastric cancer treated by gastrectomy alone or gastrectomy followed by uracil-tegafur. Patients were randomly assigned to surgery alone or to surgery and postoperative uracil-tegafur 360 mg per m(2) per day orally for 16 months. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Relapse-free survival and site of recurrence were secondary endpoints. Of 190 registered patients, 95 were randomized to each group; two patients with early cancer were subsequently excluded from the chemotherapy group. The trial was terminated before the target number of patients was reached because accrual was slower than expected. Drug-related adverse effects were mild, with no treatment-related deaths.

"Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Versus Observation in Radically Treated Stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized Phase III NVALT-11/DLCRG-02 Study. Purpose The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) reduces the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with curative intention. Patients and Methods Patients with stage III NSCLC-staged with a contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging-were randomly assigned to either observation or PCI after concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery. The primary end point-development of symptomatic brain metastases at 24 months-was defined as one or a combination of key symptoms that suggest brain metastases-signs of increased intracranial pressure, headache, nausea and vomiting, cognitive or affective disturbances, seizures, and focal neurologic symptoms-and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography demonstrating the existence of brain metastasis. Adverse effects, survival, quality of life, quality-adjusted survival, and health care costs were secondary end points. Results Between 2009 and 2015, 175 patients were randomly assigned: 87 received PCI and 88 underwent observation only. Median follow-up was 48.5 months (95% CI, 39 to 54 months). Six (7.0%) of 86 patients in the PCI group and 24 (27.2%) of 88 patients in the control group had symptomatic brain metastases ( P = .001). PCI significantly increased the time to develop symptomatic brain metastases (hazard ratio, 0.23; [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.56]; P = .0012). Median time to develop brain metastases was not reached in either arm. Overall survival was not significantly different between both arms. Grade 1 and 2 memory impairment (26 of 86 v seven of 88 patients) and cognitive disturbance (16 of 86 v three of 88 patients) were significantly increased in the PCI arm. Quality of life was only decreased 3 months post-PCI and was similar to the observation arm thereafter. Conclusion PCI significantly decreased the proportion of patients who developed symptomatic brain metastases with an increase of low-grade toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29787357/,29787357,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Observation compared to Prophylactic cranial irradiation when used to treat Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Observation versus Prophylactic cranial irradiation in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Observation and Prophylactic cranial irradiation for managing Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Observation versus Prophylactic cranial irradiation in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Observation when compared with Prophylactic cranial irradiation for Non-small cell lung cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Observation in comparison to Prophylactic cranial irradiation for the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Observation compared to Prophylactic cranial irradiation for addressing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Observation and Prophylactic cranial irradiation in the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Observation against Prophylactic cranial irradiation for managing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Observation compared to Prophylactic cranial irradiation in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Observation contrasted with Prophylactic cranial irradiation in relation to Non-small cell lung cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Observation versus Prophylactic cranial irradiation for treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Observation and Prophylactic cranial irradiation in treating Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Observation as opposed to Prophylactic cranial irradiation in managing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Observation compared to Prophylactic cranial irradiation in the context of Non-small cell lung cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Observation compares to Prophylactic cranial irradiation in terms of effectiveness for Non-small cell lung cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Observation in relation to Prophylactic cranial irradiation for the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Observation versus Prophylactic cranial irradiation for managing Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Observation's efficacy in comparison with Prophylactic cranial irradiation in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Observation against Prophylactic cranial irradiation regarding Non-small cell lung cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01282437,"{""29787357"": ""Dirk De Ruysscher|Anne-Marie C Dingemans|John Praag|Jose Belderbos|Caroline Tissing-Tan|Judith Herder|Tjeerd Haitjema|Fred Ubbels|Frank Lagerwaard|Sherif Y El Sharouni|Jos A Stigt|Egbert Smit|Harm van Tinteren|Vincent van der Noort|Harry J M Groen""}",2009-01,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Unknown
"Randomized phase III study of docetaxel versus docetaxel plus intercalated erlotinib in patients with relapsed non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma. Earlier preclinical and phase II research showed enhanced effect of docetaxel plus intercalated erlotinib. The NVALT-18 phase III study was designed to compare docetaxel with docetaxel plus intercalated erlotinib in relapsed metastasized non-squamous (NSQ) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with relapsed Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) wild type (WT) NSQ-NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1 every 21 days (control), or docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1 plus erlotinib 150 mg/day orally on day 2-16 every 21 days (experimental arm). Progression free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint, secondary objectives were duration of response, overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Between October 2016 and April 2018 a total of 45 patients were randomized and received treatment in the control (N = 23) or experimental arm (N = 22), the study was stopped due to slow accrual. Median PFS was 4.0 months (95% CI: 1.5-7.1) versus 1.9 months (95% CI 1.4-3.5), p = 0.01 respectively; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.51 (95% CI: 1.16-5.43). Corresponding median OS was 10.6 months (95% CI: 7.0-8.6) versus 4.7 months (95% CI: 3.2-8.6), p = 0.004, with an adjusted HR of 3.67 (95% CI: 1.46-9.27). Toxicity was higher with combination therapy, with toxicity ≥ CTCAE grade 3 in N = 6 (26%) in the control arm and N = 17 (77%) in the experimental arm (p < 0.001), mainly consisting of gastrointestinal symptoms and leukopenia.

"Randomized phase III trial of a neoadjuvant regimen of four cycles of adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (AC4-D4) versus a shorter treatment of three cycles of FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel (FEC3-D3) in node-positive breast cancer (Neo-shorter; NCT02001506). To determine whether six cycles of FEC3-D3 has a comparable efficacy to eight of AC4-D4. The enrolled patients (pts) were clinically diagnosed with stage II or III breast cancer. The primary endpoint was a pathologic complete response (pCR), and the secondary endpoints were 3 year disease-free survival (3Y DFS), toxicities, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We calculated that 252 pts were needed in each treatment group to enable the detection of non-inferiority (non-inferiority margin of 10%). In terms of ITT analysis, 248 pts were finally enrolled. The 218 pts who completed the surgery were included in the current analysis. The baseline characteristics of these subjects were well balanced between the two arms. By ITT analysis, pCR was achieved in 15/121 (12.4%) pts in the FEC3-D3 arm and 18/126 (14.3%) in the AC4-D4 arm. With a median follow up of 64.1 months, the 3Y DFS was comparable between the two arms (75.8% in FEC3-D3 vs. 75.6% in AC4-D4). The most common adverse event (AE) was Grade 3/4 neutropenia, which arose in 27/126 (21.4%) AC4-D4 arm pts vs 23/121 (19.0%) FEC3-D3 arm cases. The primary HRQoL domains were similar between the two groups (FACT-B scores at baseline, P = 0.35; at the midpoint of NACT, P = 0.20; at the completion of NACT, P = 0.44).

"Effects of the addition of gemcitabine, and paclitaxel-first sequencing, in neoadjuvant sequential epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel for women with high-risk early breast cancer (Neo-tAnGo): an open-label, 2×2 factorial randomised phase 3 trial. Anthracyclines and taxanes have been the standard neoadjuvant chemotherapies for breast cancer in the past decade. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of the addition of gemcitabine to accelerated paclitaxel with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, and also the effect of sequencing the blocks of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel (with or without gemcitabine). In our randomised, open-label, 2×2 factorial phase 3 trial (Neo-tAnGo), we enrolled women (aged >18 years) with newly diagnosed breast cancer (tumour size >20 mm) at 57 centres in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned via a central randomisation procedure to epirubicin and cyclophosphamide then paclitaxel (with or without gemcitabine) or paclitaxel (with or without gemcitabine) then epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Four cycles of each component were given. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR), defined as absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axillary lymph nodes. This study is registered with EudraCT (2004-002356-34), ISRCTN (78234870), and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00070278). Between Jan 18, 2005, and Sept 28, 2007, we randomly allocated 831 participants; 207 received epirubicin and cyclophosphamide then paclitaxel; 208 were given paclitaxel then epirubicin and cyclophosphamide; 208 had epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel and gemcitabine; and 208 received paclitaxel and gemcitabine then epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. 828 patients were eligible for analysis. Median follow-up was 47 months (IQR 37-51). 207 (25%) patients had inflammatory or locally advanced disease, 169 (20%) patients had tumours larger than 50 mm, 413 (50%) patients had clinical involvement of axillary nodes, 276 (33%) patients had oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease, and 191 (27%) patients had HER2-positive disease. Addition of gemcitabine did not increase pCR: 70 (17%, 95% CI 14-21) of 404 patients in the epirubicin and cyclophosphamide then paclitaxel group achieved pCR compared with 71 (17%, 14-21) of 408 patients who received additional gemcitabine (p=0·98). Receipt of a taxane before anthracycline was associated with improved pCR: 82 (20%, 95% CI 16-24) of 406 patients who received paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide achieved pCR compared with 59 (15%, 11-18) of 406 patients who received epirubicin and cyclophosphamide first (p=0·03). Grade 3 toxicities were reported at expected levels: 173 (21%) of 812 patients who received treatment and had full treatment details had grade 3 neutropenia, 66 (8%) had infection, 41 (5%) had fatigue, 41 (5%) had muscle and joint pains, 37 (5%) had nausea, 36 (4%) had vomiting, 34 (4%) had neuropathy, 23 (3%) had transaminitis, 16 (2%) had acute hypersensitivity, and 20 (2%) had a rash. 86 (11%) patients had grade 4 neutropenia and 3 (<1%) had grade 4 infection. Although addition of gemcitabine to paclitaxel and epirubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy does not improve pCR, sequencing chemotherapy so that taxanes are received before anthracyclines could improve pCR in standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

"Phase III study to evaluate temsirolimus compared with investigator's choice therapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Temsirolimus, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase, has shown clinical activity in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We evaluated two dose regimens of temsirolimus in comparison with investigator's choice single-agent therapy in relapsed or refractory disease. In this multicenter, open-label, phase III study, 162 patients with relapsed or refractory MCL were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive one of two temsirolimus regimens: 175 mg weekly for 3 weeks followed by either 75 mg (175/75-mg) or 25 mg (175/25-mg) weekly, or investigator's choice therapy from prospectively approved options. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent assessment. Median PFS was 4.8, 3.4, and 1.9 months for the temsirolimus 175/75-mg, 175/25-mg, and investigator's choice groups, respectively. Patients treated with temsirolimus 175/75-mg had significantly longer PFS than those treated with investigator's choice therapy (P = .0009; hazard ratio = 0.44); those treated with temsirolimus 175/25-mg showed a trend toward longer PFS (P = .0618; hazard ratio = 0.65). Objective response rate was significantly higher in the 175/75-mg group (22%) compared with the investigator's choice group (2%; P = .0019). Median overall survival for the temsirolimus 175/75-mg group and the investigator's choice group was 12.8 months and 9.7 months, respectively (P = .3519). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the temsirolimus groups were thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and asthenia.

"Sintilimab versus docetaxel as second-line treatment in advanced or metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer: an open-label, randomized controlled phase 3 trial (ORIENT-3). Treatment options for Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) after failure of first-line chemotherapy are limited. This study (ORIENT-3) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab versus docetaxel as second-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC. ORIENT-3 was an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled phase 3 trial that recruited patients with stage IIIB/IIIC/IV sqNSCLC after failure with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 200 mg of sintilimab or 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of docetaxel intravenously every 3 weeks, stratified by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in the full analysis set (FAS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR) and safety. Between August 25, 2017, and November 7, 2018, 290 patients were randomized. For FAS, 10 patients from the docetaxel arm were excluded. The median OS was 11.79 (n = 145; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.28-15.57) months with sintilimab versus 8.25 (n = 135; 95% CI, 6.47-9.82) months with docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96; P = 0.025). Sintilimab treatment significantly prolonged PFS (median 4.30 vs. 2.79 months; HR: 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39-0.68; P < 0.001) and showed higher ORR (25.50% vs. 2.20%, P < 0.001) and DCR (65.50% vs. 37.80%, P < 0.001) than the docetaxel arm. The median DoR was 12.45 (95% CI, 4.86-25.33) months in the sintilimab arm and 4.14 (95% CI, 1.41-7.23) months in the docetaxel arm (P = 0.045). Treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥ 3 were reported in 26 (18.1%) patients in the sintilimab arm and 47 (36.2%) patients in the docetaxel arm. Exploratory biomarker analysis showed potential predictive values of expression levels of two transcription factors, including OVOL2 (HR: 0.35; P < 0.001) and CTCF (HR: 3.50; P < 0.001)，for sintilimab treatment.

"Maintenance olaparib rechallenge in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer previously treated with a PARP inhibitor (OReO/ENGOT-ov38): a phase IIIb trial. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor maintenance therapy is the standard of care for some patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of PARP inhibitor rechallenge. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (NCT03106987) enrolled patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer who had received one prior PARP inhibitor therapy for ≥18 and ≥12 months in the BRCA-mutated and non-BRCA-mutated cohorts, respectively, following first-line chemotherapy or for ≥12 and ≥6 months, respectively, following a second or subsequent line of chemotherapy. Patients were in response following their last platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and were randomized 2 : 1 to maintenance olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily or placebo. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Seventy four patients in the BRCA-mutated cohort were randomized to olaparib and 38 to placebo, and 72 patients in the non-BRCA-mutated cohort were randomized to olaparib and 36 to placebo; >85% of patients in both cohorts had received ≥3 prior lines of chemotherapy. In the BRCA-mutated cohort, the median PFS was 4.3 months with olaparib versus 2.8 months with placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.87; P = 0.022]; 1-year PFS rates were 19% versus 0% (Kaplan-Meier estimates).

No new safety signals were identified with olaparib rechallenge. In ovarian cancer patients previously treated with one prior PARP inhibitor and at least two lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, maintenance olaparib rechallenge provided a statistically significant, albeit modest, PFS improvement over placebo in both the BRCA-mutated and non-BRCA-mutated cohorts, with a proportion of patients in the maintenance olaparib rechallenge arm of both cohorts remaining progression free at 1 year.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37797734/,37797734,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Olaparib monotherapy when used to treat Ovarian cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Placebo versus Olaparib monotherapy in treating Ovarian cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Placebo and Olaparib monotherapy for managing Ovarian cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Placebo versus Olaparib monotherapy in treating Ovarian cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Placebo when compared with Olaparib monotherapy for Ovarian cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Placebo in comparison to Olaparib monotherapy for the treatment of Ovarian cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Olaparib monotherapy for addressing Ovarian cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Placebo and Olaparib monotherapy in the treatment of Ovarian cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Olaparib monotherapy for managing Ovarian cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Placebo compared to Olaparib monotherapy in treating Ovarian cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Placebo contrasted with Olaparib monotherapy in relation to Ovarian cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Placebo versus Olaparib monotherapy for treating Ovarian cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Placebo and Olaparib monotherapy in treating Ovarian cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Placebo as opposed to Olaparib monotherapy in managing Ovarian cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Olaparib monotherapy in the context of Ovarian cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Placebo compares to Olaparib monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Ovarian cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Placebo in relation to Olaparib monotherapy for the treatment of Ovarian cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Placebo versus Olaparib monotherapy for managing Ovarian cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Placebo's efficacy in comparison with Olaparib monotherapy in treating Ovarian cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Olaparib monotherapy regarding Ovarian cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT03106987,"{""37797734"": ""E Pujade-Lauraine|F Selle|G Scambia|B Asselain|F Marmé|K Lindemann|N Colombo|R Mądry|R Glasspool|I Vergote|J Korach|S Lheureux|C Dubot|A Oaknin|C Zamagni|F Heitz|L Gladieff|M J Rubio-Pérez|P Scollo|C Blakeley|B Shaw|I Ray-Coquard|A Redondo|OReO/ENGOT-ov38 investigators""}",2017-06-08,Yes,Yes,Oral,Parp Inhibitors
"Chemotherapy vs tamoxifen in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer: a phase III, randomised, multicentre trial (Ovaresist). Chemotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) aims for palliation and prolonging of progression-free survival (PFS). This study compares Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and efficacy between single-agent chemotherapy and tamoxifen in PROC. Patients with PROC were randomised (2 : 1) to chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel 80 mg m<sup>-2</sup> or four weekly pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg m<sup>-2</sup>) or tamoxifen 40 mg daily. The primary end point was HRQoL. Secondary end points were PFS by RECIST and overall survival (OS). Between March 2002 and December 2007, 156 and 82 patients were randomised to chemotherapy and tamoxifen, respectively. In the chemotherapy arm, a significantly larger proportion of patients experienced a worsening in their social functioning. There was no difference in the proportion of patients experiencing improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms. Median PFS on tamoxifen was 8.3 weeks (95% CI, 8.0-10.4) compared with 12.7 weeks (95% CI, 9.0-16.3) on chemotherapy (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.05; log-rank P=0.003). There was no difference in OS between the treatment arms. Patients on chemotherapy had longer PFS but experienced more toxicity and poorer HRQoL compared with tamoxifen. Control over gastrointestinal symptoms was not better on chemotherapy.

"A randomized phase IIIB trial of chemotherapy, bevacizumab, and panitumumab compared with chemotherapy and bevacizumab alone for metastatic colorectal cancer. Panitumumab, a fully human antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor, is active in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This trial evaluated panitumumab added to bevacizumab and chemotherapy (oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based) as first-line treatment for mCRC. Patients were randomly assigned within each chemotherapy cohort to bevacizumab and chemotherapy with or without panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) within the oxaliplatin cohort. Tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks and reviewed centrally. A total of 823 and 230 patients were randomly assigned to the oxaliplatin and irinotecan cohorts, respectively. Panitumumab was discontinued after a planned interim analysis of 812 oxaliplatin patients showed worse efficacy in the panitumumab arm. In the final analysis, median PFS was 10.0 and 11.4 months for the panitumumab and control arms, respectively (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.52); median survival was 19.4 months and 24.5 months for the panitumumab and control arms, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events in the oxaliplatin cohort (panitumumab v control) included skin toxicity (36% v 1%), diarrhea (24% v 13%), infections (19% v 10%), and pulmonary embolism (6% v 4%). Increased toxicity without evidence of improved efficacy was observed in the panitumumab arm of the irinotecan cohort. KRAS analyses showed adverse outcomes for the panitumumab arm in both wild-type and mutant groups. The addition of panitumumab to bevacizumab and oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy results in increased toxicity and decreased PFS.

"Switch to fulvestrant and palbociclib versus no switch in advanced breast cancer with rising ESR1 mutation during aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib therapy (PADA-1): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial. In advanced oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors frequently stems from ESR1-mutated subclones, which might be sensitive to fulvestrant. The PADA-1 trial aimed to show the efficacy of an early change in therapy on the basis of a rising ESR1 mutation in blood (bESR1<sup>mut</sup>), while assessing the global safety of combination fulvestrant and palbociclib. We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in 83 hospitals in France. Women aged at least 18 years with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were recruited and monitored for rising bESR1<sup>mut</sup> during first-line aromatase inhibitor (2·5 mg letrozole, 1 mg anastrozole, or 25 mg exemestane, orally once per day, taken continuously) and palbociclib (125 mg orally once per day on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) therapy. Patients with newly present or increased bESR1<sup>mut</sup> in circulating tumour DNA and no synchronous disease progression were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue with the same therapy or to switch to fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on day 1 of each 28-day cycle and on day 15 of cycle 1) and palbociclib (dosing unchanged). The randomisation sequence was generated within an interactive web response system using a minimisation method (with an 80% random factor); patients were stratified according to visceral involvement (present or absent) and the time from inclusion to bESR1<sup>mut</sup> detection (<12 months or ≥12 months). The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival from random assignment, analysed in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all randomly assigned patients), and grade 3 or worse haematological adverse events in all patients. The trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03079011), and is now complete. From March 22, 2017, to Jan 31, 2019, 1017 patients were included, of whom 279 (27%) developed a rising bESR1<sup>mut</sup> and 172 (17%) were randomly assigned to treatment: 88 to switching to fulvestrant and palbociclib and 84 patients to continuing aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib. At database lock on July 31, 2021, randomly assigned patients had a median follow-up of 35·3 months (IQR 29·2-41·4) from inclusion and 26·0 months (13·8-34·3) from random assignment. Median progression-free survival from random assignment was 11·9 months (95% CI 9·1-13·6) in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group versus 5·7 months (3·9-7·5) in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group (stratified HR 0·61, 0·43-0·86; p=0·0040). The most frequent grade 3 or worse haematological adverse events were neutropenia (715 [70·3%] of 1017 patients), lymphopenia (66 [6·5%]), and thrombocytopenia (20 [2·0%]). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in step 2 were neutropenia (35 [41·7%] of 84 patients in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group vs 39 [44·3%] of 88 patients in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group) and lymphopenia (three [3·6%] vs four [4·5%]). 31 (3·1%) patients had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events related to treatment in the overall population. Three (1·7%) of 172 patients randomly assigned had one serious adverse event in step 2: one (1·2%) grade 4 neutropenia and one (1·2%) grade 3 fatigue among 84 patients in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group, and one (1·1%) grade 4 neutropenia among 88 patients in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group. One death by pulmonary embolism in step 1 was declared as being treatment related. PADA-1 is the first prospective randomised trial showing that the early therapeutic targeting of bESR1<sup>mut</sup> results in significant clinical benefit. Additionally, the original design explored in PADA-1 might help with tackling acquired resistance with new drugs in future trials.

"Rituximab, cladribine, and cyclophosphamide (RCC) induction with rituximab maintenance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: PALG - CLL4 (ML21283) trial. PALG CLL4 is the first, randomized, phase IIIb study with rituximab, cladribine, and cyclophosphamide (RCC) induction and subsequent maintenance with rituximab in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The induction treatment consisted of 6 RCC cycles regimen. Patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after an induction phase were randomized into a maintenance arm with rituximab or an observational arm. In the intention-to-treat population, 97 patients completed the induction phase with an overall response rate (ORR) of 73.2% (CR 22.7%, PR 50.5%). Subsequently, 66 patients were randomized into the rituximab maintenance arm (n = 33) or the observational arm (n = 33).

"The cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone as first-line treatment of oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer (PALOMA-1/TRIO-18): a randomised phase 2 study. Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 with preclinical evidence of growth-inhibitory activity in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells and synergy with anti-oestrogens. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first-line treatment of patients with advanced, oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. In this open-label, randomised phase 2 study, postmenopausal women with advanced oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer who had not received any systemic treatment for their advanced disease were eligible to participate. Patients were enrolled in two separate cohorts that accrued sequentially: in cohort 1, patients were enrolled on the basis of their oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative biomarker status alone, whereas in cohort 2 they were also required to have cancers with amplification of cyclin D1 (CCND1), loss of p16 (INK4A or CDKN2A), or both. In both cohorts, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 via an interactive web-based randomisation system, stratified by disease site and disease-free interval, to receive continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily or continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral palbociclib 125 mg, given once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off over 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Accrual to cohort 2 was stopped after an unplanned interim analysis of cohort 1 and the statistical analysis plan for the primary endpoint was amended to a combined analysis of cohorts 1 and 2 (instead of cohort 2 alone). The study is ongoing but closed to accrual; these are the results of the final analysis of progression-free survival. The study is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00721409. Between Dec 22, 2009, and May 12, 2012, we randomly assigned 165 patients, 84 to palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 to letrozole alone. At the time of the final analysis for progression-free survival (median follow-up 29.6 months [95% CI 27.9-36.0] for the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 27.9 months [25.5-31.1] for the letrozole group), 41 progression-free survival events had occurred in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 59 in the letrozole group. Median progression-free survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 5.7-12.6) for the letrozole group and 20.2 months (13.8-27.5) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.488, 95% CI 0.319-0.748; one-sided p=0.0004). In cohort 1 (n=66), median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (2.6-10.5) for the letrozole group and 26.1 months (11.2-not estimable) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.299, 0.156-0.572; one-sided p<0.0001); in cohort 2 (n=99), median progression-free survival was 11.1 months (7.1-16.4) for the letrozole group and 18.1 months (13.1-27.5) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.508, 0.303-0.853; one-sided p=0.0046). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in 45 (54%) of 83 patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group versus one (1%) of 77 patients in the letrozole group, leucopenia in 16 (19%) versus none, and fatigue in four (4%) versus one (1%). Serious adverse events that occurred in more than one patient in the palbociclib plus letrozole group were pulmonary embolism (three [4%] patients), back pain (two [2%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%]). No cases of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia-related infections were reported during the study. 11 (13%) patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and two (2%) in the letrozole group discontinued the study because of adverse events. The addition of palbociclib to letrozole in this phase 2 study significantly improved progression-free survival in women with advanced oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.

"Amivantamab plus Chemotherapy in NSCLC with <i>EGFR</i> Exon 20 Insertions. Amivantamab has been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>) exon 20 insertions who have had disease progression during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Phase 1 data showed the safety and antitumor activity of amivantamab plus carboplatin-pemetrexed (chemotherapy). Additional data on this combination therapy are needed. In this phase 3, international, randomized trial, we assigned in a 1:1 ratio patients with advanced NSCLC with <i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertions who had not received previous systemic therapy to receive intravenous amivantamab plus chemotherapy (amivantamab-chemotherapy) or chemotherapy alone. The primary outcome was progression-free survival according to blinded independent central review. Patients in the chemotherapy group who had disease progression were allowed to cross over to receive amivantamab monotherapy. A total of 308 patients underwent randomization (153 to receive amivantamab-chemotherapy and 155 to receive chemotherapy alone). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the amivantamab-chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy group (median, 11.4 months and 6.7 months, respectively; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.53; P<0.001). At 18 months, progression-free survival was reported in 31% of the patients in the amivantamab-chemotherapy group and in 3% in the chemotherapy group; a complete or partial response at data cutoff was reported in 73% and 47%, respectively (rate ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.68; P<0.001). In the interim overall survival analysis (33% maturity), the hazard ratio for death for amivantamab-chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.09; P = 0.11). The predominant adverse events associated with amivantamab-chemotherapy were reversible hematologic and EGFR-related toxic effects; 7% of patients discontinued amivantamab owing to adverse reactions. The use of amivantamab-chemotherapy resulted in superior efficacy as compared with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with <i>EGFR</i> exon 20 insertions.

"Effect of Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Carboplatin on Survival in Women With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial. The value of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains controversial, as does whether BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) germline variants are associated with platinum treatment sensitivity. To compare 6 cycles of paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PCb) with a standard-dose regimen of 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel (CEF-T). This phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted at 9 cancer centers and hospitals in China. Between July 1, 2011, and April 30, 2016, women aged 18 to 70 years with operable TNBC after definitive surgery (having pathologically confirmed regional node-positive disease or node-negative disease with tumor diameter >10 mm) were screened and enrolled. Exclusion criteria included having metastatic or locally advanced disease, having non-TNBC, or receiving preoperative anticancer therapy. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, from the intent-to-treat population as prespecified in the protocol. Participants were randomized to receive PCb (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and carboplatin [area under the curve = 2] on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for 6 cycles) or CEF-T (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 100 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles followed by docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, distant DFS, relapse-free survival, DFS in patients with germline variants in BRCA1/2 or homologous recombination repair (HRR)-related genes, and toxicity. A total of 647 patients (mean [SD] age, 51 [44-57] years) with operable TNBC were randomized to receive CEF-T (n = 322) or PCb (n = 325). At a median follow-up of 62 months, DFS time was longer in those assigned to PCb compared with CEF-T (5-year DFS, 86.5% vs 80.3%, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96; P = .03). Similar outcomes were observed for distant DFS and relapse-free survival. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the groups (HR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42-1.22, P = .22). In the exploratory and hypothesis-generating subgroup analyses of PCb vs CEF-T, the HR for DFS was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.15-1.31; P = .14) in patients with the BRCA1/2 variant and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15-0.99; P = .04) in those with the HRR variant. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profiles of relevant drugs. These findings suggest that a paclitaxel-plus-carboplatin regimen is an effective alternative adjuvant chemotherapy choice for patients with operable TNBC. In the era of molecular classification, subsets of TNBC sensitive to PCb should be further investigated.

"Androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: A randomised phase III trial. The role of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with radiotherapy (RT) in intermediate-risk prostate cancer (IRPC) remains controversial, particularly in patients receiving dose-escalated RT (DERT). We compared outcomes between patients with IRPC treated with ADT and two different doses of RT vs. RT alone. From December 2000 to September 2010, 600 patients with IRPC were randomised to a three-arm trial consisting of 6 months of ADT plus RT 70 Gy (ADT + RT70) vs. ADT plus a DERT of 76 Gy (ADT + DERT76) vs. DERT of 76 Gy alone (DERT76). Primary end-point was biochemical failure (BF), and secondary end-points were overall survival (OS) and toxicity. RT toxicity was assessed by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. With a median follow-up of 11.3 years (interquartile range: 10.9-11.7), patients receiving DERT76 alone, compared with patients receiving ADT + RT70 and ADT + DERT76, had higher rates of BF (32%, 18% and 14%, respectively, p < 0.001), higher rates of prostate cancer progression (12%, 4.5% and 3.3%, respectively, p = 0.001) and more deaths due to prostate cancer (6.5%, 3.0% and 1.5%, respectively, p = 0.03) with no significant difference seen between ADT + RT70 and ADT + DERT76. There was no significant difference in OS between the 3 arms. A higher dose of RT (76 Gy) increased late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity grade ≥ II compared with lower dose (70 Gy) (16% vs 5.3%, p < 0.001) with no statistical difference for late genitourinary toxicity. In IRPC, the addition of 6 months of ADT to RT70 or DERT76 significantly improves BF and appears to decrease the risk of death from prostate cancer compared with DERT76 alone with no difference in OS. In the setting of IRPC, ADT plus RT 70 Gy yields effective disease control with a better GI toxicity profile.

"6 versus 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive early breast cancer (PERSEPHONE): 4-year disease-free survival results of a randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial. Adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improves outcomes for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The standard treatment duration is 12 months but shorter treatment could provide similar efficacy while reducing toxicities and cost. We aimed to investigate whether 6-month adjuvant trastuzumab treatment is non-inferior to the standard 12-month treatment regarding disease-free survival. This study is an open-label, randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial. Patients were recruited from 152 centres in the UK. We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, aged 18 years or older, and with a clear indication for chemotherapy, by a computerised minimisation process (1:1), to receive either 6-month or 12-month trastuzumab delivered every 3 weeks intravenously (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (600 mg), given in combination with chemotherapy (concurrently or sequentially). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat, with a non-inferiority margin of 3% for 4-year disease-free survival. Safety was analysed in all patients who received trastuzumab. This trial is registered with EudraCT (number 2006-007018-39), ISRCTN (number 52968807), and ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00712140). Between Oct 4, 2007, and July 31, 2015, 2045 patients were assigned to 12-month trastuzumab treatment and 2044 to 6-month treatment (one patient was excluded because they were double randomised). Median follow-up was 5·4 years (IQR 3·6-6·7) for both treatment groups, during which a disease-free survival event occurred in 265 (13%) of 2043 patients in the 6-month group and 247 (12%) of 2045 patients in the 12-month group. 4-year disease-free survival was 89·4% (95% CI 87·9-90·7) in the 6-month group and 89·8% (88·3-91·1) in the 12-month group (hazard ratio 1·07 [90% CI 0·93-1·24], non-inferiority p=0·011), showing non-inferiority of the 6-month treatment. 6-month trastuzumab treatment resulted in fewer patients reporting severe adverse events (373 [19%] of 1939 patients vs 459 [24%] of 1894 patients, p=0·0002) or stopping early because of cardiotoxicity (61 [3%] of 1939 patients vs 146 [8%] of 1894 patients, p<0·0001). We have shown that 6-month trastuzumab treatment is non-inferior to 12-month treatment in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, with less cardiotoxicity and fewer severe adverse events. These results support consideration of reduced duration trastuzumab for women at similar risk of recurrence as to those included in the trial.

"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma. Daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, has been approved for use with standard myeloma regimens. An evaluation of subcutaneous daratumumab combined with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) for the treatment of transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma is needed. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 709 transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to receive either subcutaneous daratumumab combined with VRd induction and consolidation therapy and with lenalidomide maintenance therapy (D-VRd group) or VRd induction and consolidation therapy and lenalidomide maintenance therapy alone (VRd group). The primary end point was progression-free survival. Key secondary end points were a complete response or better and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status. At a median follow-up of 47.5 months, the risk of disease progression or death in the D-VRd group was lower than the risk in the VRd group. The estimated percentage of patients with progression-free survival at 48 months was 84.3% in the D-VRd group and 67.7% in the VRd group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.59; P<0.001); the P value crossed the prespecified stopping boundary (P = 0.0126). The percentage of patients with a complete response or better was higher in the D-VRd group than in the VRd group (87.9% vs. 70.1%, P<0.001), as was the percentage of patients with MRD-negative status (75.2% vs. 47.5%, P<0.001). Death occurred in 34 patients in the D-VRd group and 44 patients in the VRd group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in most patients in both groups; the most common were neutropenia (62.1% with D-VRd and 51.0% with VRd) and thrombocytopenia (29.1% and 17.3%, respectively). Serious adverse events occurred in 57.0% of the patients in the D-VRd group and 49.3% of those in the VRd group. The addition of subcutaneous daratumumab to VRd induction and consolidation therapy and to lenalidomide maintenance therapy conferred a significant benefit with respect to progression-free survival among transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

"Pacritinib vs Best Available Therapy, Including Ruxolitinib, in Patients With Myelofibrosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Myelofibrosis is a hematologic malignancy characterized by splenomegaly and debilitating symptoms. Thrombocytopenia is a poor prognostic feature and limits use of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor ruxolitinib. To compare the efficacy and safety of JAK2 inhibitor pacritinib with that of best available therapy (BAT), including ruxolitinib, in patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia. For this phase 3 randomized international multicenter study-the PERSIST-2 study-of pacritinib vs BAT, 311 patients with myelofibrosis and platelet count 100 × 109/L or less were recruited for analysis. Crossover from BAT was allowed after week 24 or for progression of splenomegaly. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to pacritinib 400 mg once daily, pacritinib 200 mg twice daily, or BAT. Coprimary end points were rates of patients achieving 35% or more spleen volume reduction (SVR) and 50% or more reduction in total symptom score (TSS) at week 24. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat efficacy population, comprising all patients with a randomization date allowing for week 24 data. Overall, 311 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.70 [9.08] years; 171 men [55%] and 140 women [45%]) were included in the study; 149 patients (48%) had prior ruxolitinib. The most common BAT was ruxolitinib (44 patients [45%]); 19 patients (19%) received watchful-waiting only. The intention-to-treat efficacy population included 75 patients randomized to pacritinib once daily; 74, pacritinib twice daily, and 72, BAT. Pacritinib (arms combined) was more effective than BAT for 35% or more SVR (27 patients [18%] vs 2 patients [3%]; P = .001) and had a nonsignificantly greater rate of 50% or more reduction in TSS (37 patients [25%] vs 10 patients [14%]; P = .08). Pacritinib twice daily led to significant improvements in both end points over BAT (≥35% SVR: 16 patients [22%] vs 2 patients [3%]; P = .001; ≥50% reduction in TSS: 24 patients [32%] vs 10 patients [14%]; P = .01). Clinical improvement in hemoglobin and reduction in transfusion burden were greatest with pacritinib twice daily. For pacritinib once daily, pacritinib twice daily, and BAT, the most common (>10%) grade 3 or 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (32 patients [31%], 34 patients [32%], 18 patients [18%]), and anemia (28 patients [27%], 23 patients [22%], 14 patients [14%]). In the pacritinib once daily, twice daily, and BAT arms, discontinuation owing to adverse events occurred in 15 patients (14%), 10 patients (9%), and 4 patients (4%). In patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia, including those with prior anti-JAK therapy, pacritinib twice daily was more effective than BAT, including ruxolitinib, for reducing splenomegaly and symptoms. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02055781.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29522138/,29522138,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy compared to Best available therapy when used to treat Myelofibrosis.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy versus Best available therapy in treating Myelofibrosis.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy and Best available therapy for managing Myelofibrosis?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy versus Best available therapy in treating Myelofibrosis.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy when compared with Best available therapy for Myelofibrosis?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy in comparison to Best available therapy for the treatment of Myelofibrosis.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy compared to Best available therapy for addressing Myelofibrosis.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy and Best available therapy in the treatment of Myelofibrosis?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy against Best available therapy for managing Myelofibrosis.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy compared to Best available therapy in treating Myelofibrosis.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy contrasted with Best available therapy in relation to Myelofibrosis?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy versus Best available therapy for treating Myelofibrosis.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy and Best available therapy in treating Myelofibrosis?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy as opposed to Best available therapy in managing Myelofibrosis.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy compared to Best available therapy in the context of Myelofibrosis.,What option most accurately summarizes how Pacritinib monotherapy compares to Best available therapy in terms of effectiveness for Myelofibrosis?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy in relation to Best available therapy for the treatment of Myelofibrosis.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Pacritinib monotherapy versus Best available therapy for managing Myelofibrosis?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Pacritinib monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Best available therapy in treating Myelofibrosis.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy against Best available therapy regarding Myelofibrosis.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT02055781,"{""29522138"": ""John Mascarenhas|Ronald Hoffman|Moshe Talpaz|Aaron T Gerds|Brady Stein|Vikas Gupta|Anita Szoke|Mark Drummond|Alexander Pristupa|Tanya Granston|Robert Daly|Suliman Al-Fayoumi|Jennifer A Callahan|Jack W Singer|Jason Gotlib|Catriona Jamieson|Claire Harrison|Ruben Mesa|Srdan Verstovsek""}",2014-02,Yes,No,Unknown,Kinase Inhibitor
"Eltrombopag for children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (PETIT2): a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial. The thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag has been shown to be safe, tolerable, and effective for adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag for children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. PETIT2 was a two part, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled study done at 38 centres in 12 countries (Argentina, Czech Republic, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA). Paediatric patients aged 1-17 years who had chronic immune thrombocytopenia and platelet counts less than 30 × 10(9) per L were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive eltrombopag or placebo. We stratified patients by age into three cohorts (patients aged 12-17 years, 6-11 years, and 1-5 years) before randomly entering them into a 13 week, double-blind period. Randomisation was done by the GlaxoSmithKline Registration and Medication Ordering System and both patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignments. Patients who were allocated eltrombopag received tablets (except for those aged 1-5 years who received an oral suspension formulation) once per day for 13 weeks. Starting doses for patients aged 6-17 were based on bodyweight, and ethnic origin and ranged between 50 mg/day and 25 mg/day (starting dose for patients aged 1-5 years was 1·2 mg/kg/day or 0·8 mg/kg/day for east Asian patients). Patients who completed the double-blind period entered a 24 week open-label treatment period in which all patients received eltrombopag at either the starting dose (if they were formerly on placebo) or their established dose. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving platelet counts of at least 50 × 10(9) per L in the absence of rescue therapy for 6 or more weeks from weeks 5 to 12 of the double-blind period. The intention-to-treat population included in the efficacy assessment consisted of all patients who were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and the safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01520909. Beginning in March 15, 2012, 92 patients were enrolled, and the trial was completed on Jan 2, 2014. 63 patients were assigned to receive eltrombopag and 29 were assigned to receive placebo. In the double-blind period, three patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events: two patients in the eltrombopag group withdrew because of increased liver aminotransferases and one in the placebo group withdrew because of abdominal haemorrhage. 25 (40%) patients who received eltrombopag compared with one (3%) patient who received placebo achieved the primary outcome of platelet counts of at least 50 × 10(9) per L for 6 of the last 8 weeks of the double-blind period (odds ratio 18·0, 95% CI, 2·3-140·9; p=0·0004). Responses were similar in all cohorts (eltrombopag vs placebo: 39% vs 10% for patients aged 12-17 years, 42% vs 0% for patients aged 6-11 years, and 36% vs 0% for patients aged 1-5 years). Proportionately fewer patients who received eltrombopag (23 [37%] of 63 patients) had WHO grades 1-4 bleeding at the end of the double-blind period than did those who received placebo (16 [55%] of 29 patients); grades 2-4 bleeding were similar (three [5%] patients who received eltrombopag vs two [7%] patients who received placebo). During the 24-week open-label treatment period, 70 [80%] of 87 patients achieved platelet counts of 50 × 10(9) per L or more at least once. Adverse events that occurred more frequently with eltrombopag than with placebo included nasopharyngitis (11 [17%] patients), rhinitis (10 [16%] patients), upper respiratory tract infection (7 [11%] patients), and cough (7 [11%] patients). Serious adverse events occurred in five (8%) patients who received eltrombopag and four (14%) who received placebo. Safety was consistent between the open-label and double-blind periods. No deaths, malignancies, or thromboses occurred during the trial. Eltrombopag, which produced a sustained platelet response in 40% of patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia, is a suitable therapeutic option for children with chronic symptomatic immune thrombocytopenia. We identified no new safety concerns and few patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events.

"Neoadjuvant pyrotinib, trastuzumab, and docetaxel for HER2-positive breast cancer (PHEDRA): a double-blind, randomized phase 3 trial. Pyrotinib (an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor) plus capecitabine has survival benefits and acceptable tolerability in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. We further assessed addition of pyrotinib to trastuzumab and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting. In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 study (PHEDRA), treatment-naive women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of oral pyrotinib or placebo (400 mg) once daily, plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg) and docetaxel (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR; ypT0/is and ypN0) rate per independent central review. Between Jul 23, 2018, and Jan 8, 2021, 355 patients were randomly assigned, 178 to the pyrotinib group and 177 to the placebo group. The majority of patients completed four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment as planned (92.7% and 97.7% in the pyrotinib and placebo groups, respectively). The tpCR rate was 41.0% (95% CI 34.0 to 48.4) in the pyrotinib group compared with 22.0% (95% CI 16.6 to 28.7) in the placebo group (difference, 19.0% [95% CI 9.5 to 28.4]; one-sided P < 0.0001). The objective response rate per investigator was 91.6% (95% CI 86.6 to 94.8) in the pyrotinib group and 81.9% (95% CI 75.6 to 86.9) in the placebo group after the neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in an increase of 9.7% (95% CI 2.7 to 16.6). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhea (79 [44.4%] in the pyrotinib group and nine [5.1%] in the placebo group), neutropenia (33 [18.5%] and 36 [20.3%]), and decreased white blood cell count (29 [16.3%] and 24 [13.6%]).

"Adavosertib plus gemcitabine for platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory recurrent ovarian cancer: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. The Wee1 (WEE1hu) inhibitor adavosertib and gemcitabine have shown preclinical synergy and promising activity in early phase clinical trials. We aimed to determine the efficacy of this combination in patients with ovarian cancer. In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, women with measurable recurrent platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory high-grade serous ovarian cancer were recruited from 11 academic centres in the USA and Canada. Women were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, a life expectancy of more than 3 months, and normal organ and marrow function. Women with ovarian cancer of non-high-grade serous histology were eligible for enrolment in a non-randomised exploratory cohort. Eligible participants with high-grade serous ovarian cancer were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation (block size of three and six) and no stratification, to receive intravenous gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15) with either oral adavosertib (175 mg) or identical placebo once daily on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients and the team caring for each patient were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. The safety and efficacy analysis population comprised all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02151292, and is closed to accrual. Between Sept 22, 2014, and May 30, 2018, 124 women were enrolled, of whom 99 had high-grade serous ovarian cancer and were randomly assigned to adavosertib plus gemcitabine (65 [66%]) or placebo plus gemcitabine (34 [34%]). 25 women with non-high-grade serous ovarian cancer were enrolled in the exploratory cohort. After randomisation, five patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer were found to be ineligible (four in the experimental group and one in the control group) and did not receive treatment. Median age for all treated patients (n=119) was 62 years (IQR 54-67). Progression-free survival was longer with adavosertib plus gemcitabine (median 4·6 months [95% CI 3·6-6·4] with adavosertib plus gemcitabine vs 3·0 months [1·8-3·8] with placebo plus gemcitabine; hazard ratio 0·55 [95% CI 0·35-0·90]; log-rank p=0·015). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were haematological (neutropenia in 38 [62%] of 61 participants in the adavosertib plus gemcitabine group vs ten [30%] of 33 in the placebo plus gemcitabine group; thrombocytopenia in 19 [31%] of 61 in the adavosertib plus gemcitabine group vs two [6%] of 33 in the placebo plus gemcitabine group). There were no treatment-related deaths; two patients (one in each group in the high-grade serous ovarian cancer cohort) died while on study medication (from sepsis in the experimental group and from disease progression in the control group). The observed clinical efficacy of a Wee1 inhibitor combined with gemcitabine supports ongoing assessment of DNA damage response drugs in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, a TP53-mutated tumour type with high replication stress. This therapeutic approach might be applicable to other tumour types with high replication stress; larger confirmatory studies are required.

"Randomized multicenter phase 2 study of pomalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in relapsed refractory myeloma. Pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (PomDex) is standard treatment of lenalidomide refractory myeloma patients who have received >2 prior therapies. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of oral weekly cyclophosphamide to standard PomDex. We first performed a dose escalation phase 1 study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of cyclophosphamide in combination with PomDex (arm A). A randomized, multicenter phase 2 study followed, enrolling patients with lenalidomide refractory myeloma. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive pomalidomide 4 mg on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle in combination with weekly dexamethasone (arm B) or pomalidomide, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide (PomCyDex) 400 mg orally on days 1, 8, and 15 (arm C). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Eighty patients were enrolled (10 in phase 1 and 70 randomized in phase 2: 36 to arm B and 34 to arm C). The ORR was 38.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23-54.8%) and 64.7% (95% CI, 48.6-80.8%) for arms B and C, respectively (P = .035). As of June 2015, 62 of the 70 randomized patients had progressed.

"Polatuzumab Vedotin in Previously Untreated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is typically treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). However, only 60% of patients are cured with R-CHOP. Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b, which is ubiquitously expressed on the surface of malignant B cells. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase 3 trial to evaluate a modified regimen of R-CHOP (pola-R-CHP), in which vincristine was replaced with polatuzumab vedotin, as compared with standard R-CHOP, in patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk or high-risk DLBCL. Patients 18 to 80 years of age were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive six cycles of either pola-R-CHP or R-CHOP, plus two cycles of rituximab alone. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety. Overall, 879 patients underwent randomization: 440 were assigned to the pola-R-CHP group and 439 to the R-CHOP group. After a median follow-up of 28.2 months, the percentage of patients surviving without progression was significantly higher in the pola-R-CHP group than in the R-CHOP group (76.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 72.7 to 80.8] vs. 70.2% [95% CI, 65.8 to 74.6] at 2 years; stratified hazard ratio for progression, relapse, or death, 0.73 by Cox regression; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.95; P = 0.02). Overall survival at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups (88.7% [95% CI, 85.7 to 91.6] in the pola-R-CHP group and 88.6% [95% CI, 85.6 to 91.6] in the R-CHOP group; hazard ratio for death, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.37; P = 0.75). The safety profile was similar in the two groups. Among patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk or high-risk DLBCL, the risk of disease progression, relapse, or death was lower among those who received pola-R-CHP than among those who received R-CHOP.

"Continuous enzalutamide after progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel (PRESIDE): an international, randomised, phase 3b study. Although androgen deprivation therapy is typically given long-term for men with metastatic prostate cancer, second-generation hormone therapies are generally discontinued before the subsequent line of treatment. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of continuing enzalutamide after progression in controlling metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with docetaxel and prednisolone. PRESIDE was a two-period, multinational, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b study done at 123 sites in Europe (in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK). Patients were eligible for period 1 (P1) of the study if they had histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma without neuroendocrine differentiation or small-cell features, serum testosterone concentrations of 1·73 nmol/L or less, and had progressed during androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist or after bilateral orchiectomy. In P1, patients received open-label enzalutamide 160 mg per day orally. At week 13, patients were assessed for either radiographic or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (25% or more increase and 2 ng/mL or more above nadir). Patients who showed any decline in PSA at week 13 and subsequently progressed (radiographic progression, PSA progression, or both) were screened and enrolled in period 2 (P2), during which eligible patients were treated with up to ten cycles of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks and oral prednisolone 10 mg/day, and randomly assigned (1:1) to oral enzalutamide 160 mg/day or oral placebo. Patients were stratified by type of disease progression. The block size was four and the overall number of blocks was 400. Patients, investigators, and study organisers were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival analysed in all patients in P2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02288247, and is no longer recruiting. Between Dec 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2016, 816 patients were screened for P1 of the study. 688 patients were enrolled in P1 and 687 received open-label enzalutamide. In P2, 271 patients were randomly assigned at 73 sites to receive enzalutamide (n=136) or placebo (n=135). The data cutoff for analysis was April 30, 2020. Median progression-free survival with enzalutamide was 9·5 months (95% CI 8·3-10·9) versus 8·3 months (6·3-8·7) with placebo (hazard ratio 0·72 [95% CI 0·53-0·96]; p=0·027). The most common grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (17 [13%] of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 12 [9%] of 135 patients in the placebo group) and asthenia (ten [7%] vs six [4%]). The most common grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse event in P2 was neutropenia (23 [17%] of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 28 [21%] of 135 patients in the placebo group). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 67 (49%) of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group and 52 (39%) of 135 patients in the placebo group. Two (15%) of 13 deaths in the enzalutamide group (caused by septic shock and haematuria) and one (14%) of seven deaths in the placebo group (caused by actue kidney injury) were associated with docetaxel. PRESIDE met its primary endpoint and showed that continuing enzalutamide with docetaxel plus androgen deprivation therapy delayed time to progression compared with docetaxel plus androgen deprivation therapy alone, supporting the hypothesis that enzalutamide maintenance could control persistent androgen-dependent clones in men with mCRPC who progress after treatment with enzalutamide alone.

"PRESTO: A Phase III, Open-Label Study of Intensification of Androgen Blockade in Patients With High-Risk Biochemically Relapsed Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (AFT-19). Patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BRPC) after radical prostatectomy and a short PSA doubling time are at risk for distant metastases. Apalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) prolong survival in the metastatic setting. We evaluated whether intensification of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves outcomes in BRPC. PRESTO is a randomized phase III, open-label trial in patients with BRPC and PSA doubling time ≤9 months (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03009981). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive a finite 52-week treatment course with ADT control, ADT + apalutamide, or ADT + apalutamide + AAP. The primary end point was PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), defined as serum PSA >0.2 ng/mL after treatment completion. Five hundred three patients were enrolled. The median PSA was 1.8 ng/mL (IQR, 1.0-3.6). At the first planned interim analysis, both experimental arms significantly prolonged PSA-PFS compared with the control arm (median, 24.9 months for ADT + apalutamide <i>v</i> 20.3 months for ADT; hazard ratio [HR], 0.52 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.77]; <i>P</i> = .00047; median, 26.0 months for ADT + apalutamide + AAP <i>v</i> 20.0 months for ADT; HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.71]; <i>P</i> = .00008). Median time to testosterone recovery did not differ across treatment arms. The most common grade ≥3 adverse event was hypertension (7.5%, 7.4%, and 18% in ADT, ADT + apalutamide, and ADT + apalutamide + AAP arms, respectively). Intensified AR blockade for a finite duration prolongs PSA-PFS with a manageable safety profile, without adversely affecting time to testosterone recovery.

"Aspirin or Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin for Thromboprophylaxis after a Fracture. Clinical guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with fractures, but trials of its effectiveness as compared with aspirin are lacking. In this pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, we enrolled patients 18 years of age or older who had a fracture of an extremity (anywhere from hip to midfoot or shoulder to wrist) that had been treated operatively or who had any pelvic or acetabular fracture. Patients were randomly assigned to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) at a dose of 30 mg twice daily or aspirin at a dose of 81 mg twice daily while they were in the hospital. After hospital discharge, the patients continued to receive thromboprophylaxis according to the clinical protocols of each hospital. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were nonfatal pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, and bleeding complications. A total of 12,211 patients were randomly assigned to receive aspirin (6101 patients) or low-molecular-weight heparin (6110 patients). Patients had a mean (±SD) age of 44.6±17.8 years, 0.7% had a history of venous thromboembolism, and 2.5% had a history of cancer. Patients received a mean of 8.8±10.6 in-hospital thromboprophylaxis doses and were prescribed a median 21-day supply of thromboprophylaxis at discharge. Death occurred in 47 patients (0.78%) in the aspirin group and in 45 patients (0.73%) in the low-molecular-weight-heparin group (difference, 0.05 percentage points; 96.2% confidence interval, -0.27 to 0.38; P<0.001 for a noninferiority margin of 0.75 percentage points). Deep-vein thrombosis occurred in 2.51% of patients in the aspirin group and 1.71% in the low-molecular-weight-heparin group (difference, 0.80 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.31). The incidence of pulmonary embolism (1.49% in each group), bleeding complications, and other serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. In patients with extremity fractures that had been treated operatively or with any pelvic or acetabular fracture, thromboprophylaxis with aspirin was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing death and was associated with low incidences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and low 90-day mortality.

"Treatment With Niraparib Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Advanced Ovarian Cancer: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial. The efficacy of niraparib maintenance therapy with an individualized starting dose (ISD) warrants further investigation in a broad population with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer (aOC), including patients without postoperative residual disease. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib with an ISD in a broad population with newly diagnosed aOC (R0 resection permitted). This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was conducted in China and enrolled 384 patients with newly diagnosed aOC who received primary or interval debulking surgery and responded to treatment with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. By data cutoff (September 30, 2021), median follow-up for progression-free survival (PFS) was 27.5 (IQR, 24.7-30.4) months. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo with ISD (200 mg/d for those with a body weight of <77 kg and/or platelet count of <150 ×103/μL [to convert to ×109/μL, multiply by 1] at baseline; 300 mg/d otherwise) stratified by germline BRCA variant status, tumor homologous recombination deficiency status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary end point was blinded, independent central review-assessed PFS in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 384 patients were randomized (255 niraparib [66.4%]; median [range] age, 53 [32-77] years; 129 placebo [33.6%]; median [range] age, 54 [33-77] years), and 375 (247 niraparib [65.9%], 128 placebo [34.1%]) received treatment at a dose of 200 mg per day. Median PFS with niraparib vs placebo was 24.8 vs 8.3 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34-0.60; P < .001) in the intention-to-treat population; not reached vs 10.8 months (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23-0.68) and 19.3 vs 8.3 months (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34-0.67) in patients with and without germline BRCA variants, respectively; not reached vs 11.0 months (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34-0.68) and 16.6 vs 5.5 months (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.75) in homologous recombination deficient and proficient patients, respectively; and 24.8 vs 8.3 months (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.32-0.61) and 16.5 vs 8.3 months (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10-0.72) in those with optimal and suboptimal debulking, respectively. Similar proportions of niraparib-treated and placebo-treated patients (6.7% vs 5.4%) discontinued treatment due to treatment-emergent adverse events. This randomized clinical trial found that niraparib maintenance therapy prolonged PFS in patients with newly diagnosed aOC regardless of postoperative residual disease or biomarker status.

Adjuvant chemotherapy after D2 gastrectomy is standard for resectable locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) in Asia. Based on positive findings for perioperative chemotherapy in European phase III studies, the phase III PRODIGY study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01515748) investigated whether neoadjuvant docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and S-1 (DOS) followed by surgery and adjuvant S-1 could improve outcomes versus standard treatment in Korean patients with resectable LAGC. Patients 20-75 years of age, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and with histologically confirmed primary gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (clinical TNM staging: T2-3N+ or T4Nany) were randomly assigned to D2 surgery followed by adjuvant S-1 (40-60 mg orally twice a day, days 1-28 every 6 weeks for eight cycles; SC group) or neoadjuvant DOS (docetaxel 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, oxaliplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously day 1, S-1 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice a day, days 1-14 every 3 weeks for three cycles) before D2 surgery, followed by adjuvant S-1 (CSC group).

"Results of PROFILE 1029, a Phase III Comparison of First-Line Crizotinib versus Chemotherapy in East Asian Patients with ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. The phase III randomized PROFILE 1014 study demonstrated superiority of crizotinib to first-line chemotherapy in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated patients with ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-positive advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. This result was consistent with that in the smaller subset of East Asian patients in PROFILE 1014. The subsequent study reported here prospectively evaluated crizotinib in a larger East Asian patient population. In this open-label phase III study (PROFILE 1029), patients were randomized 1:1 to receive orally administered crizotinib 250 mg twice daily continuously (3-week cycles) or intravenously administered chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, plus cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, or carboplatin [at a dose to produce area under the concentration-time curve of 5-6 mg·min/mL]) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. PFS confirmed by independent radiology review was the primary end point. Crizotinib significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio, 0.402; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.286-0.565; p < 0.001). The median PFS was 11.1 months with crizotinib and 6.8 months with chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 87.5% (95% CI: 79.6-93.2%) with crizotinib versus 45.6% (95% CI: 35.8-55.7%) with chemotherapy (p < 0.001). The most common adverse events were increased transaminase levels, diarrhea, and vision disorders with crizotinib and leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia with chemotherapy.

"Placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective, randomized study on the effect of octreotide LAR in the control of tumor growth in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine midgut tumors: a report from the PROMID Study Group. Somatostatin analogs are indicated for symptom control in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The ability of somatostatin analogs to control the growth of well-differentiated metastatic NETs is a matter of debate. We performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIIB study in patients with well-differentiated metastatic midgut NETs. The hypothesis was that octreotide LAR prolongs time to tumor progression and survival. Treatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or octreotide LAR 30 mg intramuscularly in monthly intervals until tumor progression or death. The primary efficacy end point was time to tumor progression. Secondary end points were survival time and tumor response. This report is based on 67 tumor progressions and 16 observed deaths in 85 patients at the time of the planned interim analysis. Median time to tumor progression in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups was 14.3 and 6 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.59; P = .000072). After 6 months of treatment, stable disease was observed in 66.7% of patients in the octreotide LAR group and 37.2% of patients in the placebo group. Functionally active and inactive tumors responded similarly. The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor load and resected primary tumor. Seven and nine deaths were observed in the octreotide LAR and placebo groups, respectively. The HR for overall survival was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.30 to 2.18). Octreotide LAR significantly lengthens time to tumor progression compared with placebo in patients with functionally active and inactive metastatic midgut NETs. Because of the low number of observed deaths, survival analysis was not confirmatory.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19704057/,19704057,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy compared to Placebo when used to treat Pancreatic NET.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Pancreatic NET.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy and Placebo for managing Pancreatic NET?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy versus Placebo in treating Pancreatic NET.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy when compared with Placebo for Pancreatic NET?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy in comparison to Placebo for the treatment of Pancreatic NET.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy compared to Placebo for addressing Pancreatic NET.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy and Placebo in the treatment of Pancreatic NET?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy against Placebo for managing Pancreatic NET.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy compared to Placebo in treating Pancreatic NET.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy contrasted with Placebo in relation to Pancreatic NET?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy versus Placebo for treating Pancreatic NET.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy and Placebo in treating Pancreatic NET?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy as opposed to Placebo in managing Pancreatic NET.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy compared to Placebo in the context of Pancreatic NET.,What option most accurately summarizes how Octreotide LAR monotherapy compares to Placebo in terms of effectiveness for Pancreatic NET?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy in relation to Placebo for the treatment of Pancreatic NET.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Octreotide LAR monotherapy versus Placebo for managing Pancreatic NET?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Octreotide LAR monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Placebo in treating Pancreatic NET.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Octreotide LAR monotherapy against Placebo regarding Pancreatic NET.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00171873,"{""19704057"": ""Anja Rinke|Hans-Helge Müller|Carmen Schade-Brittinger|Klaus-Jochen Klose|Peter Barth|Matthias Wied|Christina Mayer|Behnaz Aminossadati|Ulrich-Frank Pape|Michael Bläker|Jan Harder|Christian Arnold|Thomas Gress|Rudolf Arnold|PROMID Study Group""}",2001-09,Yes,Yes,Intramuscular,Unknown
"Pegase 03: a prospective randomized phase III trial of FEC with or without high-dose thiotepa, cyclophosphamide and autologous stem cell transplantation in first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Pegase 03 is a multicenter prospective randomized phase III trial evaluating the impact of first-line high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with stem cell support on overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and response rate in 308 patients with histologically proven metastatic breast cancer responding to induction therapy. Eligible patients received four induction cycles with FEC 100 (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)). Patients with objective response (N=179) were randomized to one cycle of HDC (cyclophosphamide 6000 mg/m(2) and thiotepa 800 mg/m(2) (CHUT)) and stem cell support (N=88), or no further treatment (N=91). All patients were observed until disease progression or death. One toxic death occurred after CHUT. Other toxicities were manageable. The response rate at 3 months was higher in the intensification arm: 82.7% (25.3% complete response (CR)) versus 59.2% (14.1% CR) (P=0.0002). Median follow-up was 48 months. Median DFS was 11 and 6.6 months in the intensification and the observation arms, respectively (P=0.0001).

"Comparison of fluorouracil with additional levamisole, higher-dose folinic acid, or both, as adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer: a randomised trial. QUASAR Collaborative Group. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer consists of fluorouracil with folinic acid or levamisole. The large QUASAR randomised trial aimed to investigate (in a two x two design) whether use of a higher dose of folinic acid or addition of levamisole to fluorouracil and folinic acid improved survival. Patients with colorectal cancer, without evident residual disease, were randomly assigned fluorouracil (370 mg/m2) with high-dose (175 mg) or low-dose (25 mg) L-folinic acid and either active or placebo levamisole. The fluorouracil and folinic acid could be given either as six 5-day courses with 4 weeks between the start of the courses or as 30 once-weekly doses. Levamisole (50 mg) or placebo was given three times daily for 3 days repeated every 2 weeks for 12 courses. The primary endpoint was mortality from any cause. Analyses were by intention to treat. Between 1994 and 1997, 4,927 patients were enrolled. 1,776 had recurrences and 1,576 died. Survival was similar with high-dose and low-dose folinic acid (70.1% vs 71.0% at 3 years; p=0-43), as were 3-year recurrence rates (36.0% vs 35.8%; p=0.94). Survival was worse with levamisole than with placebo (69.4% vs 71.5% at 3 years; p=0.06), and there were more recurrences with the active drug (37.0% vs 34.9% at 3 years; p=0.16). The inclusion of levamisole in chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer does not delay recurrence or improve survival. Higher-dose folinic acid produced no extra benefit in these regimens over that from low-dose folinic acid. Trials of chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy will show whether these four treatments are equally effective or equally ineffective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10821362/,10821362,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of FULV and Levamisole compared to FULV (L-Leucovorin) when used to treat Colorectal cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole versus FULV (L-Leucovorin) in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of FULV and Levamisole and FULV (L-Leucovorin) for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole versus FULV (L-Leucovorin) in treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of FULV and Levamisole when compared with FULV (L-Leucovorin) for Colorectal cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole in comparison to FULV (L-Leucovorin) for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of FULV and Levamisole compared to FULV (L-Leucovorin) for addressing Colorectal cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole and FULV (L-Leucovorin) in the treatment of Colorectal cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of FULV and Levamisole against FULV (L-Leucovorin) for managing Colorectal cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole compared to FULV (L-Leucovorin) in treating Colorectal cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of FULV and Levamisole contrasted with FULV (L-Leucovorin) in relation to Colorectal cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole versus FULV (L-Leucovorin) for treating Colorectal cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of FULV and Levamisole and FULV (L-Leucovorin) in treating Colorectal cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole as opposed to FULV (L-Leucovorin) in managing Colorectal cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of FULV and Levamisole compared to FULV (L-Leucovorin) in the context of Colorectal cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how FULV and Levamisole compares to FULV (L-Leucovorin) in terms of effectiveness for Colorectal cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of FULV and Levamisole in relation to FULV (L-Leucovorin) for the treatment of Colorectal cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of FULV and Levamisole versus FULV (L-Leucovorin) for managing Colorectal cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of FULV and Levamisole's efficacy in comparison with FULV (L-Leucovorin) in treating Colorectal cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of FULV and Levamisole against FULV (L-Leucovorin) regarding Colorectal cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00005586,"{""10821362"": """"}",1997-10,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Antimetabolites
"Oral Azacitidine Maintenance Therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Remission. Although induction chemotherapy results in remission in many older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapse is common and overall survival is poor. We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the oral formulation of azacitidine (CC-486, a hypomethylating agent that is not bioequivalent to injectable azacitidine), as maintenance therapy in patients with AML who were in first remission after intensive chemotherapy. Patients who were 55 years of age or older, were in complete remission with or without complete blood count recovery, and were not candidates for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation were randomly assigned to receive CC-486 (300 mg) or placebo once daily for 14 days per 28-day cycle. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival and health-related quality of life. A total of 472 patients underwent randomization; 238 were assigned to the CC-486 group and 234 were assigned to the placebo group. The median age was 68 years (range, 55 to 86). Median overall survival from the time of randomization was significantly longer with CC-486 than with placebo (24.7 months and 14.8 months, respectively; P<0.001). Median relapse-free survival was also significantly longer with CC-486 than with placebo (10.2 months and 4.8 months, respectively; P<0.001). Benefits of CC-486 with respect to overall and relapse-free survival were shown in most subgroups defined according to baseline characteristics. The most common adverse events in both groups were grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events. Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (in 41% of patients in the CC-486 group and 24% of patients in the placebo group) and thrombocytopenia (in 22% and 21%, respectively). Overall health-related quality of life was preserved during CC-486 treatment. CC-486 maintenance therapy was associated with significantly longer overall and relapse-free survival than placebo among older patients with AML who were in remission after chemotherapy. Side effects were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms and neutropenia. Quality-of-life measures were maintained throughout treatment.

"High-Dose Chemotherapy and Blood Autologous Stem-Cell Rescue Compared With Standard Chemotherapy in Localized High-Risk Ewing Sarcoma: Results of Euro-E.W.I.N.G.99 and Ewing-2008. Purpose For over 30 years, the place of consolidation high-dose chemotherapy in Ewing sarcoma (ES) has been controversial. A randomized study was conducted to determine whether consolidation high-dose chemotherapy improved survival in patients with localized ES at high risk for relapse. Methods Randomization between busulfan and melphalan (BuMel) or standard chemotherapy (vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide [VAI], seven courses) was offered to patients if they were younger than 50 years of age with poor histologic response (≥ 10% viable cells) after receiving vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (six courses); or had a tumor volume at diagnosis ≥ 200 mL if unresected, or initially resected, or resected after radiotherapy. A 15% improvement in 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was sought (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60). Results Between 2000 and 2015, 240 patients classified as high risk (median age, 17.1 years) were randomly assigned to VAI (n = 118) or BuMel (n = 122). Seventy-eight percent entered the trial because of poor histologic response after chemotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 7.8 years. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the risk of event was significantly decreased by BuMel compared with VAI: HR, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.95; P = .026); 3- and 8-year EFS were, respectively, 69.0% (95% CI, 60.2% to 76.6%) versus 56.7% (95% CI, 47.6% to 65.4%) and 60.7% (95% CI, 51.1% to 69.6%) versus 47.1% (95% CI, 37.7% to 56.8%). Overall survival (OS) also favored BuMel: HR, 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.95; P = .028); 3- and 8-year OS were, respectively, 78.0% (95% CI, 69.6% to 84.5%) versus 72.2% (95% CI, 63.3% to 79.6%) and 64.5% (95% CI, 54.4% to 73.5%) versus 55.6% (95% CI, 45.8% to 65.1%). Results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis. Two patients died as a result of BuMel-related toxicity, one after standard chemotherapy. Significantly more BuMel patients experienced severe acute toxicities from this course of chemotherapy compared with multiple VAI courses. Conclusion BuMel improved EFS and OS when given after vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide induction in localized ES with predefined high-risk factors. For this group of patients, BuMel may be an important addition to the standard of care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30188789/,30188789,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan compared to VAI when used to treat Ewing sarcoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan versus VAI in treating Ewing sarcoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan and VAI for managing Ewing sarcoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan versus VAI in treating Ewing sarcoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan when compared with VAI for Ewing sarcoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan in comparison to VAI for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan compared to VAI for addressing Ewing sarcoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan and VAI in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan against VAI for managing Ewing sarcoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan compared to VAI in treating Ewing sarcoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan contrasted with VAI in relation to Ewing sarcoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan versus VAI for treating Ewing sarcoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan and VAI in treating Ewing sarcoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan as opposed to VAI in managing Ewing sarcoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan compared to VAI in the context of Ewing sarcoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how Busulfan and Melphalan compares to VAI in terms of effectiveness for Ewing sarcoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan in relation to VAI for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Busulfan and Melphalan versus VAI for managing Ewing sarcoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Busulfan and Melphalan's efficacy in comparison with VAI in treating Ewing sarcoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Busulfan and Melphalan against VAI regarding Ewing sarcoma.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00020566,"{""30188789"": ""Jeremy Whelan|Marie-Cecile Le Deley|Uta Dirksen|Gwénaël Le Teuff|Bernadette Brennan|Nathalie Gaspar|Douglas S Hawkins|Susanne Amler|Sebastian Bauer|Stefan Bielack|Jean-Yves Blay|Stefan Burdach|Marie-Pierre Castex|Dagmar Dilloo|Angelika Eggert|Hans Gelderblom|Jean-Claude Gentet|Wolfgang Hartmann|Wolf-Achim Hassenpflug|Lars Hjorth|Marta Jimenez|Thomas Klingebiel|Udo Kontny|Jarmila Kruseova|Ruth Ladenstein|Valerie Laurence|Cyril Lervat|Perrine Marec-Berard|Sandrine Marreaud|Jean Michon|Bruce Morland|Michael Paulussen|Andreas Ranft|Peter Reichardt|Hendrik van den Berg|Keith Wheatley|Ian Judson|Ian Lewis|Alan Craft|Heribert Juergens|Odile Oberlin|Euro-E.W.I.N.G.99 and EWING-2008 Investigators""}",2001-02,Yes,Yes,Oral,Chemotherapy
"Efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab as second-line therapy for the treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (RAINBOW-Asia): a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 trial. In the global phase 3 RAINBOW study, ramucirumab plus paclitaxel significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. RAINBOW-Asia, a bridging study with similar design to RAINBOW, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel for advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in Asian, predominantly Chinese, patients. RAINBOW-Asia was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 32 centres in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Adult patients (≥18 years) with metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who previously received fluoropyrimidine-platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned with a centralised interactive web response system in a 2:1 ratio to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Randomisation was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and presence of peritoneal metastases. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02898077, and has been completed. Between March 2, 2017, and June 30, 2020, 440 patients were randomly assigned to receive ramucirumab plus paclitaxel (n=294) or placebo plus paclitaxel (n=146). Median progression-free survival was 4·14 months (95% CI 3·71-4·30) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group compared with 3·15 months (2·83-4·14) in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·765, 95% CI 0·613-0·955, p=0·0184). Median overall survival was 8·71 months (95% CI 7·98-9·49) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group and 7·92 months (6·31-9·10) in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (HR 0·963, 95% CI 0·771-1·203, p=0·7426). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (159 [54%] of 293 patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group vs 56 [39%] of 145 in the placebo plus paclitaxel group), decreased white blood cell count (127 [43%] vs 42 [29%]), anaemia (46 [16%] vs 24 [17%]), hypertension (21 [7%] vs nine [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (18 [6%] vs one [<1%]).

"Midostaurin plus Chemotherapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia with a FLT3 Mutation. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a FLT3 mutation have poor outcomes. We conducted a phase 3 trial to determine whether the addition of midostaurin - an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that is active in patients with a FLT3 mutation - to standard chemotherapy would prolong overall survival in this population. We screened 3277 patients, 18 to 59 years of age, who had newly diagnosed AML for FLT3 mutations. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard chemotherapy (induction therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine and consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine) plus either midostaurin or placebo; those who were in remission after consolidation therapy entered a maintenance phase in which they received either midostaurin or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to subtype of FLT3 mutation: point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) or internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation with either a high ratio (>0.7) or a low ratio (0.05 to 0.7) of mutant to wild-type alleles (ITD [high] and ITD [low], respectively). Allogeneic transplantation was allowed. The primary end point was overall survival. A total of 717 patients underwent randomization; 360 were assigned to the midostaurin group, and 357 to the placebo group. The FLT3 subtype was ITD (high) in 214 patients, ITD (low) in 341 patients, and TKD in 162 patients. The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to age, race, FLT3 subtype, cytogenetic risk, and blood counts but not with respect to sex (51.7% in the midostaurin group vs. 59.4% in the placebo group were women, P=0.04). Overall survival was significantly longer in the midostaurin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.78; one-sided P=0.009), as was event-free survival (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.78; one-sided P=0.002). In both the primary analysis and an analysis in which data for patients who underwent transplantation were censored, the benefit of midostaurin was consistent across all FLT3 subtypes. The rate of severe adverse events was similar in the two groups. The addition of the multitargeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin to standard chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall and event-free survival among patients with AML and a FLT3 mutation.

"Rituximab plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prolongs progression-free survival compared with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 cell surface antigen, has clinical activity in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other B-lymphocyte disorders when administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Promising results have previously been reported in nonrandomized studies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This trial was designed to compare chemoimmunotherapy with chemotherapy alone in patients with previously treated CLL. This international, multicenter, randomized trial compared six cycles of rituximab plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) with six cycles of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone (FC) in patients with previously treated CLL. A total of 552 patients with Binet stage A (1%), B (59%), or C (31%) disease entered the study and were randomly assigned to receive R-FC (n = 276) or FC (n = 276). After a median follow-up time of 25 months, rituximab significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with previously treated CLL (hazard ratio = 0.65; P < .001; median, 30.6 months for R-FC v 20.6 months for FC). Event-free survival, response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, and time to new CLL treatment or death were also significantly improved. Although the rates of adverse events, grade 3 or 4 events, and serious adverse events were slightly higher in the R-FC arm, R-FC was generally well tolerated, with no new safety findings and no detrimental effect on quality of life.

"Rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip arthroplasty. This phase 3 trial compared the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban, an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa, with those of enoxaparin for extended thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. In this randomized, double-blind study, we assigned 4541 patients to receive either 10 mg of oral rivaroxaban once daily, beginning after surgery, or 40 mg of enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily, beginning the evening before surgery, plus a placebo tablet or injection. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of deep-vein thrombosis (either symptomatic or detected by bilateral venography if the patient was asymptomatic), nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause at 36 days (range, 30 to 42). The main secondary efficacy outcome was major venous thromboembolism (proximal deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from venous thromboembolism). The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. A total of 3153 patients were included in the superiority analysis (after 1388 exclusions), and 4433 were included in the safety analysis (after 108 exclusions). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 18 of 1595 patients (1.1%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 58 of 1558 patients (3.7%) in the enoxaparin group (absolute risk reduction, 2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 3.7; P<0.001). Major venous thromboembolism occurred in 4 of 1686 patients (0.2%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 33 of 1678 patients (2.0%) in the enoxaparin group (absolute risk reduction, 1.7%; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.5; P<0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 6 of 2209 patients (0.3%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 2 of 2224 patients (0.1%) in the enoxaparin group (P=0.18). A once-daily, 10-mg oral dose of rivaroxaban was significantly more effective for extended thromboprophylaxis than a once-daily, 40-mg subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin in patients undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty.

The risk of venous thromboembolism is high after total hip arthroplasty and could persist after hospital discharge. Our aim was to compare the use of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis with short-term thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin. 2509 patients scheduled to undergo elective total hip arthroplasty were randomly assigned, stratified according to centre, with a computer-generated randomisation code, to receive oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for 31-39 days (with placebo injection for 10-14 days; n=1252), or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily subcutaneously for 10-14 days (with placebo tablet for 31-39 days; n=1257). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of deep-vein thrombosis (symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by mandatory, bilateral venography), non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and all-cause mortality up to day 30-42.

"Rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after total knee arthroplasty (RECORD4): a randomised trial. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism is recommended for at least 10 days after total knee arthroplasty; oral regimens could enable shorter hospital stays. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty. In a randomised, double-blind, phase III study, 3148 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty received either oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily, beginning 6-8 h after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 h, starting 12-24 h after surgery. Patients had mandatory bilateral venography between days 11 and 15. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any deep-vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause up to day 17 after surgery. Efficacy was assessed as non-inferiority of rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin in the per-protocol population (absolute non-inferiority limit -4%); if non-inferiority was shown, we assessed whether rivaroxaban had superior efficacy in the modified intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00362232.

"Lenvatinib versus sorafenib in first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial. In a phase 2 trial, lenvatinib, an inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1-3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptor α, RET, and KIT, showed activity in hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare overall survival in patients treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. This was an open-label, phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority trial that recruited patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received treatment for advanced disease, at 154 sites in 20 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-web response system-with region; macroscopic portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; and bodyweight as stratification factors-to receive oral lenvatinib (12 mg/day for bodyweight ≥60 kg or 8 mg/day for bodyweight <60 kg) or sorafenib 400 mg twice-daily in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause. The efficacy analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle, and only patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1·08. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01761266. Between March 1, 2013 and July 30, 2015, 1492 patients were recruited. 954 eligible patients were randomly assigned to lenvatinib (n=478) or sorafenib (n=476). Median survival time for lenvatinib of 13·6 months (95% CI 12·1-14·9) was non-inferior to sorafenib (12·3 months, 10·4-13·9; hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·06), meeting criteria for non-inferiority. The most common any-grade adverse events were hypertension (201 [42%]), diarrhoea (184 [39%]), decreased appetite (162 [34%]), and decreased weight (147 [31%]) for lenvatinib, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (249 [52%]), diarrhoea (220 [46%]), hypertension (144 [30%]), and decreased appetite (127 [27%]) for sorafenib. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The safety and tolerability profiles of lenvatinib were consistent with those previously observed.

Biosimilars are highly similar to the licensed biologic (""reference product""), with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, or potency between the two products. This comparative 52-week clinical study evaluated the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of PF-05280586 (Ruxience™ [a rituximab biosimilar]) versus rituximab reference product sourced from the EU (MabThera<sup>®</sup>; rituximab-EU). Subjects with CD20-positive, low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma (LTB-FL) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 were randomized (1:1) to PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously [once weekly for 4 weeks at days 1, 8, 15, and 22]), stratified using the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 classification. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at week 26 (percentage of subjects achieving complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Therapeutic equivalence was concluded if the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in ORR between groups was within the prespecified margin (± 16%). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), CR rate, safety, immunogenicity, PK, and PD. A total of 394 subjects were randomized: PF-05280586 (n = 196) or rituximab-EU (n = 198). ORR at week 26 was 75.5% (PF-05280586) versus 70.7% (rituximab-EU), for a difference of 4.66%; 95% CI (- 4.16 to 13.47), which was entirely within the prespecified equivalence margin. Rates of CR were 29.3% (PF-05280586) versus 31.0% (rituximab-EU). Estimated 1-year PFS rates were 78.2% (95% CI 70.2-84.2) and 83.0% (95% CI 75.0-88.6) for PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU, respectively. Safety, immunogenicity, and mean serum concentrations were similar between groups.

"PF-06439535 (a Bevacizumab Biosimilar) Compared with Reference Bevacizumab (Avastin<sup>®</sup>), Both Plus Paclitaxel and Carboplatin, as First-Line Treatment for Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized, Double-Blind Study. PF-06439535 is a bevacizumab biosimilar. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of PF-06439535 with that of reference bevacizumab (Avastin<sup>®</sup>) sourced from the EU (bevacizumab-EU), each with paclitaxel and carboplatin, in the first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this double-blind, parallel-group study, we recruited patients from 159 centers in 27 countries. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive PF-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4-6 cycles, followed by blinded monotherapy with PF-06439535 or bevacizumab-EU until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study. Randomization was stratified by region, sex, and smoking history. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in accordance with RECIST 1.1, based on responses achieved by week 19 and confirmed by week 25. Between 21 May 2015 and 14 November 2016, 719 patients were randomized to the PF-06439535 group (n = 358) or the bevacizumab-EU group (n = 361). As of data cutoff for analysis of the primary endpoint (8 May 2017), 45.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40.01-50.57) of patients in the PF-06439535 group and 44.6% (95% CI 39.40-49.89) of patients in the bevacizumab-EU group achieved an objective response by week 19 that was confirmed by week 25. The unstratified ORR risk ratio was 1.015 (95% CI 0.863-1.193; 90% CI 0.886-1.163), and the unstratified ORR risk difference was 0.653% (95% CI - 6.608 to 7.908); all three CIs fell within pre-specified equivalence margins. Using final data after study completion (22 December 2017), no notable differences in progression-free survival or overall survival were observed between the groups. The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension, neutropenia, and anemia. There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety, pharmacokinetics, or immunogenicity across treatment groups. Among patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC, PF-06439535 demonstrated similarity to bevacizumab-EU in terms of efficacy. Safety profiles for the two treatments were comparable.

"Lenalidomide Maintenance Compared With Placebo in Responding Elderly Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Treated With First-Line Rituximab Plus Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone. Purpose The standard treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, has shown activity in DLBCL. This randomized phase III trial compared lenalidomide as maintenance therapy with placebo in elderly patients with DLBCL who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to R-CHOP induction. Methods Patients with previously untreated DLBCL or other aggressive B-cell lymphoma were 60 to 80 years old, had CR or PR after six or eight cycles of R-CHOP, and were randomly assigned to lenalidomide maintenance 25 mg/d or placebo for 21 days of every 28-day cycle for 24 months. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results A total of 650 patients were randomly assigned. At the time of the primary analysis (December 2015), with a median follow-up of 39 months from random assignment, median PFS was not reached for lenalidomide maintenance versus 58.9 months for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.708; 95% CI, 0.537 to 0.933; P = .01). The result was consistent among analyzed subgroups (eg, male v female, age-adjusted International Prognostic Index 0 or 1 v 2 or 3, age younger than 70 v ≥ 70 years), response (PR v CR) after R-CHOP, and positron emission tomography status at assignment (negative v positive). With longer median follow-up of 52 months (October 2016), overall survival was similar between arms (hazard ratio, 1.218; 95% CI, 0.861 to 1.721; P = .26).

"Ramucirumab plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel for second-line treatment of stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer after disease progression on platinum-based therapy (REVEL): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial. Ramucirumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of treatment with docetaxel plus ramucirumab or placebo as second-line treatment for patients with stage IV non-small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC) after platinum-based therapy. In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial (REVEL), we enrolled patients with squamous or non-squamous NSCLC who had progressed during or after a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) with a centralised, interactive voice-response system (stratified by sex, region, performance status, and previous maintenance therapy [yes vs no]) to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) and either ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo on day 1 of a 21 day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or death. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all patients allocated to treatment. We assessed adverse events according to treatment received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01168973. Between Dec 3, 2010, and Jan 24, 2013, we screened 1825 patients, of whom 1253 patients were randomly allocated to treatment. Median overall survival was 10·5 months (IQR 5·1-21·2) for 628 patients allocated ramucirumab plus docetaxel and 9·1 months (4·2-18·0) for 625 patients who received placebo plus docetaxel (hazard ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·75-0·98; p=0·023). Median progression-free survival was 4·5 months (IQR 2·3-8·3) for the ramucirumab group compared with 3·0 months (1·4-6·9) for the control group (0·76, 0·68-0·86; p<0·0001). We noted treatment-emergent adverse events in 613 (98%) of 627 patients in the ramucirumab safety population and 594 (95%) of 618 patients in the control safety population. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (306 patients [49%] in the ramucirumab group vs 246 [40%] in the control group), febrile neutropenia (100 [16%] vs 62 [10%]), fatigue (88 [14%] vs 65 [10%]), leucopenia (86 [14%] vs 77 [12%]), and hypertension (35 [6%] vs 13 [2%]). The numbers of deaths from adverse events (31 [5%] vs 35 [6%]) and grade 3 or worse pulmonary haemorrhage (eight [1%] vs eight [1%]) did not differ between groups. Toxicities were manageable with appropriate dose reductions and supportive care. Ramucirumab plus docetaxel improves survival as second-line treatment of patients with stage IV NSCLC.

"RIBBON-1: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (BV) when combined with several standard chemotherapy regimens versus those regimens alone for first-line treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio to chemotherapy plus BV or chemotherapy plus placebo. Before random assignment, investigators chose capecitabine (Cape; 2,000 mg/m(2) for 14 days), taxane (Tax) -based (nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m(2), docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m(2)), or anthracycline (Anthra) -based (doxorubicin or epirubicin combinations [doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, or fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide]) chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks. BV or placebo was administered at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), 1-year survival rate, objective response rate, duration of objective response, and safety. Two independently powered cohorts defined by the choice of chemotherapy (Cape patients or pooled Tax/Anthra patients) were analyzed in parallel. RIBBON-1 (Regimens in Bevacizumab for Breast Oncology) enrolled 1,237 patients (Cape cohort, n = 615; Tax/Anthra cohort, n = 622). Median PFS was longer for each BV combination (Cape cohort: increased from 5.7 months to 8.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84; log-rank P < .001; and Tax/Anthra cohort: increased from 8.0 months to 9.2 months; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.80; log-rank P < .001). No statistically significant differences in OS between the placebo- and BV-containing arms were observed. Safety was consistent with results of prior BV trials.

This phase III study compared the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab combined with standard chemotherapy regimens versus chemotherapy alone as second-line treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to chemotherapy + bevacizumab or to chemotherapy + placebo. Before random assignment, investigators chose capecitabine, a taxane (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or docetaxel), gemcitabine, or vinorelbine. Dosing for bevacizumab or placebo was 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, depending on chemotherapy regimen. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, PFS by chemotherapy cohort, objective response rate (ORR), duration of objective response, 1-year survival rate, and safety. RIBBON-2 enrolled 684 patients (225, chemotherapy + placebo; 459, chemotherapy + bevacizumab). The combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant benefit. Median PFS increased from 5.1 to 7.2 months (stratified hazard ratio for PFS, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.93; P = .0072). The 10% improvement in ORR between the placebo- and bevacizumab-containing arms (39.5% v 29.6%; P = .0193), although not statistically significant, was consistent with previous trials. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) related to bevacizumab treatment were hypertension (9.0%) and proteinuria (3.1%). There was an increased number of AEs leading to study discontinuation in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab arm compared with the chemotherapy + placebo arm (13.3% v 7.2%).

"Dose-Reduced Versus Standard Conditioning Followed by Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation for Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome: A Prospective Randomized Phase III Study of the EBMT (RICMAC Trial). Purpose To compare a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) with a myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) before allogeneic transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) within a randomized trial. Patients and Methods Within the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial that compared a busulfan-based RIC with MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 129 patients were enrolled from 18 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and were stratified according to donor, age, and blast count. Results Engraftment was comparable between both groups. The CI of acute graft-versus-host disease II to IV was 32.3% after RIC and 37.5% after MAC ( P = .35). The CI of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 61.6% after RIC and 64.7% after MAC ( P = .76). The CI of nonrelapse mortality after 1 year was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 25% (95% CI, 15% to 36%) after MAC ( P = .29). The CI of relapse at 2 years was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 15% (95% CI, 6% to 24%) after MAC ( P = .6), which resulted in a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival of 62% (95% CI, 50% to 74%) and 76% (95% CI, 66% to 87%), respectively, after RIC, and 58% (95% CI, 46% to 71%) and 63% (95% CI, 51% to 75%), respectively, after MAC ( P = .58 and P = .08, respectively). Conclusion This prospective, randomized trial of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation provides evidence that RIC resulted in at least a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival similar to MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28463633/,28463633,"Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT compared to Busulfan and Fludarabine when used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT versus Busulfan and Fludarabine in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT and Busulfan and Fludarabine for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome?","Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT versus Busulfan and Fludarabine in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT when compared with Busulfan and Fludarabine for Myelodysplastic syndrome?","Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT in comparison to Busulfan and Fludarabine for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT compared to Busulfan and Fludarabine for addressing Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT and Busulfan and Fludarabine in the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome?","Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT against Busulfan and Fludarabine for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT compared to Busulfan and Fludarabine in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.","What option best characterizes the efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT contrasted with Busulfan and Fludarabine in relation to Myelodysplastic syndrome?","Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT versus Busulfan and Fludarabine for treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT and Busulfan and Fludarabine in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome?","Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT as opposed to Busulfan and Fludarabine in managing Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT compared to Busulfan and Fludarabine in the context of Myelodysplastic syndrome.","What option most accurately summarizes how Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT compares to Busulfan and Fludarabine in terms of effectiveness for Myelodysplastic syndrome?","Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT in relation to Busulfan and Fludarabine for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT versus Busulfan and Fludarabine for managing Myelodysplastic syndrome?","Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT's efficacy in comparison with Busulfan and Fludarabine in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome.","Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, then allo HSCT against Busulfan and Fludarabine regarding Myelodysplastic syndrome.",2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01203228,"{""28463633"": ""Nicolaus Kröger|Simona Iacobelli|Georg-Nikolaus Franke|Uwe Platzbecker|Ruzena Uddin|Kai Hübel|Christof Scheid|Thomas Weber|Marie Robin|Matthias Stelljes|Boris Afanasyev|Dominik Heim|Giorgio Lambertenghi Deliliers|Francesco Onida|Peter Dreger|Massimo Pini|Stefano Guidi|Liisa Volin|Andreas Günther|Wolfgang Bethge|Xavier Poiré|Guido Kobbe|Marleen van Os|Ronald Brand|Theo de Witte""}",2004-05,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Unknown
"Six versus eight cycles of bi-weekly CHOP-14 with or without rituximab in elderly patients with aggressive CD20+ B-cell lymphomas: a randomised controlled trial (RICOVER-60). Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) is used to treat patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Interval decrease from 3 weeks of treatment (CHOP-21) to 2 weeks (CHOP-14), and addition of rituximab to CHOP-21 (R-CHOP-21) has been shown to improve outcome in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This randomised trial assessed whether six or eight cycles of R-CHOP-14 can improve outcome of these patients compared with six or eight cycles of CHOP-14. 1222 elderly patients (aged 61-80 years) were randomly assigned to six or eight cycles of CHOP-14 with or without rituximab. Radiotherapy was planned to sites of initial bulky disease with or without extranodal involvement. The primary endpoint was event-free survival; secondary endpoints were response, progression during treatment, progression-free survival, overall survival, and frequency of toxic effects. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on National Cancer Institute website, number NCT00052936 and as EU-20243. 3-year event-free survival was 47.2% after six cycles of CHOP-14 (95% CI 41.2-53.3), 53.0% (47.0-59.1) after eight cycles of CHOP-14, 66.5% (60.9-72.0) after six cycles of R-CHOP-14, and 63.1% (57.4-68.8) after eight cycles of R-CHOP-14. Compared with six cycles of CHOP-14, the improvement in 3-year event-free survival was 5.8% (-2.8-14.4) for eight cycles of CHOP-14, 19.3% (11.1-27.5) for six cycles of R-CHOP-14, and 15.9% (7.6-24.2) for eight cycles of R-CHOP-14. 3-year overall survival was 67.7% (62.0-73.5) for six cycles of CHOP-14, 66.0% (60.1-71.9) for eight cycles of CHOP-14, 78.1% (73.2-83.0) for six cycles of R-CHOP-14, and 72.5% (67.1-77.9) for eight cycles of R-CHOP-14. Compared with treatment with six cycles of CHOP-14, overall survival improved by -1.7% (-10.0-6.6) after eight cycles of CHOP-14, 10.4% (2.8-18.0) after six cycles of R-CHOP-14, and 4.8% (-3.1-12.7) after eight cycles of R-CHOP-14. In a multivariate analysis that used six cycles of CHOP-14 without rituximab as the reference, and adjusting for known prognostic factors, all three intensified regimens improved 3-year event-free survival (eight cycles of CHOP-14: RR [relative risk] 0.76 [0.60-0.95], p=0.0172; six cycles of R-CHOP-14: RR 0.51 [0.40-0.65], p<0.0001; eight cycles of R-CHOP-14: RR 0.54 [0.43-0.69], p<0.0001). Progression-free survival improved after six cycles of R-CHOP-14 (RR 0.50 [0.38-0.67], p<0.0001), and eight cycles of R-CHOP-14 (RR 0.59 [0.45-0.77], p=0.0001). Overall survival improved only after six cycles of R-CHOP-14 (RR 0.63 [0.46-0.85], p=0.0031). In patients with a partial response after four cycles of chemotherapy, eight cycles were not better than six cycles. Six cycles of R-CHOP-14 significantly improved event-free, progression-free, and overall survival over six cycles of CHOP-14 treatment. Response-adapted addition of chemotherapy beyond six cycles, though widely practiced, is not justified. Of the four regimens assessed in this study, six cycles of R-CHOP-14 is the preferred treatment for elderly patients, with which other approaches should be compared.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18226581/,18226581,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of R-CHOP-14 compared to CHOP-14 when used to treat Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 versus CHOP-14 in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of R-CHOP-14 and CHOP-14 for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 versus CHOP-14 in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of R-CHOP-14 when compared with CHOP-14 for Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 in comparison to CHOP-14 for the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of R-CHOP-14 compared to CHOP-14 for addressing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 and CHOP-14 in the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of R-CHOP-14 against CHOP-14 for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 compared to CHOP-14 in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of R-CHOP-14 contrasted with CHOP-14 in relation to Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 versus CHOP-14 for treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of R-CHOP-14 and CHOP-14 in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 as opposed to CHOP-14 in managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of R-CHOP-14 compared to CHOP-14 in the context of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how R-CHOP-14 compares to CHOP-14 in terms of effectiveness for Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of R-CHOP-14 in relation to CHOP-14 for the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of R-CHOP-14 versus CHOP-14 for managing Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of R-CHOP-14's efficacy in comparison with CHOP-14 in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of R-CHOP-14 against CHOP-14 regarding Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00052936,"{""18226581"": ""Michael Pfreundschuh|Joerg Schubert|Marita Ziepert|Rudolf Schmits|Martin Mohren|Eva Lengfelder|Marcel Reiser|Christina Nickenig|Michael Clemens|Norma Peter|Carsten Bokemeyer|Hartmut Eimermacher|Anthony Ho|Martin Hoffmann|Roland Mertelsmann|Lorenz Trümper|Leopold Balleisen|Ruediger Liersch|Bernd Metzner|Frank Hartmann|Bertram Glass|Viola Poeschel|Norbert Schmitz|Christian Ruebe|Alfred C Feller|Markus Loeffler|German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (DSHNHL)""}",2001-01,Yes,Yes,Rectal,Chemotherapy|Corticosteroids
"Rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine as first-line therapy in advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (RILOMET-1): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the ligand of the MET receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine, and to assess potential biomarkers, in patients with advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done at 152 centres in 27 countries. We recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, MET-positive tumours (≥25% of tumour cells with membrane staining of ≥1+ staining intensity), and evaluable disease, who had not received previous systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised voice response system to receive rilotumumab 15 mg/kg intravenously or placebo in combination with open-label chemotherapy (epirubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously; cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously; capecitabine 625 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily) in 21-day cycles for up to ten cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, patients continued to receive rilotumumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression, intolerability, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Randomisation was stratified by disease extent and ECOG performance status. Both patients and physicians were masked to study treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. We report the final analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01697072. Between Nov 7, 2012, and Nov 21, 2014, 609 patients were randomly assigned to rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (rilotumumab group; n=304) or placebo plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (placebo group; n=305). Study treatment was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee found a higher number of deaths in the rilotumumab group than in the placebo group; all patients in the rilotumumab group subsequently discontinued all study treatment. Median follow-up was 7·7 months (IQR 3·6-12·0) for patients in the rilotumumab group and 9·4 months (5·3-13·1) for patients in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 8·8 months (95% CI 7·7-10·2) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10·7 months (9·6-12·4) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1·34, 95% CI 1·10-1·63; p=0·003). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the rilotumumab and placebo groups were neutropenia (86 [29%] of 298 patients vs 97 [32%] of 299 patients), anaemia (37 [12%] vs 43 [14%]), and fatigue (30 [10%] vs 35 [12%]). The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the rilotumumab and placebo groups (142 [48%] vs 149 [50%]). More deaths due to adverse events occurred in the rilotumumab group than the placebo group (42 [14%] vs 31 [10%]). In the rilotumumab group, 33 (11%) of 298 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and nine (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. In the placebo group, 23 (8%) of 299 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and eight (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. Ligand-blocking inhibition of the MET pathway with rilotumumab is not effective in improving clinical outcomes in patients with MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

"Primary results of ROSE/TRIO-12, a randomized placebo-controlled phase III trial evaluating the addition of ramucirumab to first-line docetaxel chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. Currently, antiangiogenic strategies in metastatic breast cancer have demonstrated modest improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) but not improved quality or duration of survival, warranting evaluation of new agents in a placebo-controlled setting. Ramucirumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and blocks ligand-stimulated activation. The ROSE/TRIO-012 trial evaluated ramucirumab with docetaxel in unresectable, locally recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multinational phase III trial, 1,144 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative breast cancer who had not received cytotoxic chemotherapy in the advanced setting were randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus ramucirumab 10 mg/kg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus placebo once every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria. Patients were stratified by previous taxane therapy, visceral metastasis, hormone receptor status, and geographic region. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw the trial. The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS. Median PFS in patients treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel was 9.5 months, compared with 8.2 months in patients who received placebo plus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; P = .077). Median overall survival was 27.3 months in patients who received ramucirumab plus docetaxel, compared with 27.2 months in patients who received placebo plus docetaxel (HR, 1.01; P = .915). Toxicities seen at significantly higher rates in patients receiving ramucirumab included fatigue, hypertension, febrile neutropenia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and stomatitis. Addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel in HER2-negative advanced breast cancer did not meaningfully improve important clinical outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25185099/,25185099,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy compared to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy versus Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy and Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy versus Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy when compared with Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy in comparison to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy compared to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy and Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy against Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy compared to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy contrasted with Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy versus Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy and Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy as opposed to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy compared to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Docetaxel monotherapy compares to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy in relation to Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Docetaxel monotherapy versus Docetaxel and Ramucirumab for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Docetaxel monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Docetaxel and Ramucirumab in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel monotherapy against Docetaxel and Ramucirumab regarding Breast cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00703326,"{""25185099"": ""John R Mackey|Manuel Ramos-Vazquez|Oleg Lipatov|Nicole McCarthy|Dmitriy Krasnozhon|Vladimir Semiglazov|Alexey Manikhas|Karen A Gelmon|Gottfried E Konecny|Marc Webster|Roberto Hegg|Sunil Verma|Vera Gorbunova|Dany Abi Gerges|Francois Thireau|Helena Fung|Lorinda Simms|Marc Buyse|Ayman Ibrahim|Miguel Martin""}",2008-08-06,Yes,Yes,Intravenous,Taxanes
"Radiotherapy and short-term androgen deprivation for localized prostate cancer. It is not known whether short-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) before and during radiotherapy improves cancer control and overall survival among patients with early, localized prostate adenocarcinoma. From 1994 through 2001, we randomly assigned 1979 eligible patients with stage T1b, T1c, T2a, or T2b prostate adenocarcinoma and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 20 ng per milliliter or less to radiotherapy alone (992 patients) or radiotherapy with 4 months of total androgen suppression starting 2 months before radiotherapy (radiotherapy plus short-term ADT, 987 patients). The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included disease-specific mortality, distant metastases, biochemical failure (an increasing level of PSA), and the rate of positive findings on repeat prostate biopsy at 2 years. The median follow-up period was 9.1 years. The 10-year rate of overall survival was 62% among patients receiving radiotherapy plus short-term ADT (the combined-therapy group), as compared with 57% among patients receiving radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death with radiotherapy alone, 1.17; P=0.03). The addition of short-term ADT was associated with a decrease in the 10-year disease-specific mortality from 8% to 4% (hazard ratio for radiotherapy alone, 1.87; P=0.001). Biochemical failure, distant metastases, and the rate of positive findings on repeat prostate biopsy at 2 years were significantly improved with radiotherapy plus short-term ADT. Acute and late radiation-induced toxic effects were similar in the two groups. The incidence of grade 3 or higher hormone-related toxic effects was less than 5%. Reanalysis according to risk showed reductions in overall and disease-specific mortality primarily among intermediate-risk patients, with no significant reductions among low-risk patients. Among patients with stage T1b, T1c, T2a, or T2b prostate adenocarcinoma and a PSA level of 20 ng per milliliter or less, the use of short-term ADT for 4 months before and during radiotherapy was associated with significantly decreased disease-specific mortality and increased overall survival.

"Sequential vs. concurrent chemoradiation for stage III non-small cell lung cancer: randomized phase III trial RTOG 9410. The combination of chemotherapy with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) compared with TRT alone has been shown to confer a survival advantage for good performance status patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is not known whether sequential or concurrent delivery of these therapies is the optimal combination strategy. A total of 610 patients were randomly assigned to two concurrent regimens and one sequential chemotherapy and TRT regimen in a three-arm phase III trial. The sequential arm included cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29 and vinblastine at 5 mg/m2 per week for 5 weeks with 63 Gy TRT delivered as once-daily fractions beginning on day 50. Arm 2 used the same chemotherapy regimen as arm 1 with 63 Gy TRT delivered as once-daily fractions beginning on day 1 [corrected]. Arm 3 used cisplatin at 50 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 with oral etoposide at 50 mg twice daily for 10 weeks on days 1, 2, 5, and 6 with 69.6 Gy delivered as 1.2 Gy twice-daily fractions beginning on day 1. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included tumor response and time to tumor progression. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess survival, and toxic effects were examined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Median survival times were 14.6, 17.0, and 15.6 months for arms 1-3, respectively. Five-year survival was statistically significantly higher for patients treated with the concurrent regimen with once-daily TRT compared with the sequential treatment (5-year survival: sequential, arm 1, 10% [20 patients], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7% to 15%; concurrent, arm 2, 16% [31 patients], 95% CI = 11% to 22%, P = .046; concurrent, arm 3, 13% [22 patients], 95% CI = 9% to 18%). With a median follow-up time of 11 years, the rates of acute grade 3-5 nonhematologic toxic effects were higher with concurrent than sequential therapy, but late toxic effects were similar.

"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab for high-risk squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG-0234. To report results of a randomized phase II trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG-0234) examining concurrent chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab in the postoperative treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with high-risk pathologic features. Eligibility required pathologic stage III to IV SCCHN with gross total resection showing positive margins and/or extracapsular nodal extension and/or two or more nodal metastases. Patients were randomly assigned to 60 Gy radiation with cetuximab once per week plus either cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) or docetaxel 15 mg/m(2) once per week. Between April 2004 and December 2006, 238 patients were enrolled. With a median follow-up of 4.4 years, 2-year overall survival (OS) was 69% for the cisplatin arm and 79% for the docetaxel arm; 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 57% and 66%, respectively. Patients with p16-positive oropharynx tumors showed markedly improved survival outcome relative to patients with p16-negative oropharynx tumors. Grade 3 to 4 myelosuppression was observed in 28% of patients in the cisplatin arm and 14% in the docetaxel arm; mucositis was observed in 56% and 54%, respectively. DFS in this study was compared with that in the chemoradiotherapy arm of the RTOG-9501 trial (Phase III Intergroup Trial of Surgery Followed by Radiotherapy Versus Radiochemotherapy for Resectable High Risk Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck), which had a hazard ratio of 0.76 for the cisplatin arm versus control (P = .05) and 0.69 for the docetaxel arm versus control (P = .01), reflecting absolute improvement in 2-year DFS of 2.5% and 11.1%, respectively. The delivery of postoperative chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab to patients with SCCHN is feasible and tolerated with predictable toxicity.

"Chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine versus fluorouracil for locally advanced rectal cancer: a randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial. Fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy is regarded as a standard perioperative treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer. We investigated the efficacy and safety of substituting fluorouracil with the oral prodrug capecitabine. This randomised, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial began in March, 2002, as an adjuvant trial comparing capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy with fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy, in patients aged 18 years or older with pathological stage II-III locally advanced rectal cancer from 35 German institutions. Patients in the capecitabine group were scheduled to receive two cycles of capecitabine (2500 mg/m(2) days 1-14, repeated day 22), followed by chemoradiotherapy (50·4 Gy plus capecitabine 1650 mg/m(2) days 1-38), then three cycles of capecitabine. Patients in the fluorouracil group received two cycles of bolus fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2) days 1-5, repeated day 29), followed by chemoradiotherapy (50·4 Gy plus infusional fluorouracil 225 mg/m(2) daily), then two cycles of bolus fluorouracil. The protocol was amended in March, 2005, to allow a neoadjuvant cohort in which patients in the capecitabine group received chemoradiotherapy (50·4 Gy plus capecitabine 1650 mg/m(2) daily) followed by radical surgery and five cycles of capecitabine (2500 mg/m(2) per day for 14 days) and patients in the fluorouracil group received chemoradiotherapy (50·4 Gy plus infusional fluorouracil 1000 mg/m(2) days 1-5 and 29-33) followed by radical surgery and four cycles of bolus fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2) for 5 days). Patients were randomly assigned to treatment group in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks, with stratification by centre and tumour stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival; analyses were done based on all patients with post-randomisation data. Non-inferiority of capecitabine in terms of 5-year overall survival was tested with a 12·5% margin. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01500993. Between March, 2002, and December, 2007, 401 patients were randomly allocated; 392 patients were evaluable (197 in the capecitabine group, 195 in the fluorouracil group), with a median follow-up of 52 months (IQR 41-72). 5-year overall survival in the capecitabine group was non-inferior to that in the fluorouracil group (76% [95% CI 67-82] vs 67% [58-74]; p=0·0004; post-hoc test for superiority p=0·05). 3-year disease-free survival was 75% (95% CI 68-81) in the capecitabine group and 67% (59-73) in the fluorouracil group (p=0·07). Similar numbers of patients had local recurrences in each group (12 [6%] in the capecitabine group vs 14 [7%] in the fluorouracil group, p=0·67), but fewer patients developed distant metastases in the capecitabine group (37 [19%] vs 54 [28%]; p=0·04). Diarrhoea was the most common adverse event in both groups (any grade: 104 [53%] patients in the capecitabine group vs 85 [44%] in the fluorouracil group; grade 3-4: 17 [9%] vs four [2%]). Patients in the capecitabine group had more hand-foot skin reactions (62 [31%] any grade, four [2%] grade 3-4 vs three [2%] any grade, no grade 3-4), fatigue (55 [28%] any grade, no grade 3-4 vs 29 [15%], two [1%] grade 3-4), and proctitis (31 [16%] any grade, one [<1%] grade 3-4 vs ten [5%], one [<1%] grade 3-4) than did those in the fluorouracil group, whereas leucopenia was more frequent with fluorouracil than with capecitabine (68 [35%] any grade, 16 [8%] grade 3-4 vs 50 [25%] any grade, three [2%] grade 3-4). Capecitabine could replace fluorouracil in adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimens for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

"Efficacy and safety of subcutaneous rituximab versus intravenous rituximab for first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma (SABRINA): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Intravenous rituximab is the standard of care in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and is administered over 1·5-6 h. A subcutaneous formulation could reduce patients' treatment burden and improve resource utilisation in health care. We aimed to show the pharmacokinetic non-inferiority of subcutaneous rituximab to intravenous rituximab in follicular lymphoma and to provide efficacy and safety data. SABRINA is a two-stage, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 113 centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed, previously untreated, CD20-positive grade 1, 2, or 3a follicular lymphoma; Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance statuses of 0-2; bidimensionally measurable disease (by CT or MRI); life expectancy of 6 months or more; adequate haematological function for 28 days or more; and one or more symptoms requiring treatment according to the Groupe d'Etudes des Lymphomes Folliculaires criteria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by investigators or members of the research team via a dynamic randomisation algorithm to 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous rituximab or 1400 mg subcutaneous rituximab, plus chemotherapy (six-to-eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP] or eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone [CVP]), every 3 weeks during induction, then rituximab maintenance every 8 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by selected chemotherapy, Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index, and region. The primary endpoint for stage 2 was overall response (ie, confirmed complete response, unconfirmed complete response, and partial response) at the end of induction. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Pooled data from stages 1 and 2 are reported on the basis of the clinical cutoff date of the last patient completing the maintenance phase of the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01200758; new patients are no longer being recruited, but some patients are still being followed up. Between Feb 15, 2011, and May 15, 2013, 410 patients were randomly assigned, 205 to intravenous rituximab and 205 to subcutaneous rituximab. Investigator-assessed overall response at the end of induction was 84·9% (95% CI 79·2-89·5) in the intravenous group and 84·4% (78·7-89·1) in the subcutaneous group. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups (199 [95%] of 210 in the intravenous group vs 189 [96%] of 197 in the subcutaneous group); the frequency of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was also similar (116 [55%] vs 111 [56%]). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event was neutropenia, which occurred in 44 patients (21%) in the intravenous group and 52 (26%) in the subcutaneous group. Serious adverse events occurred in 72 patients (34%) in the intravenous group and 73 (37%) in the subcutaneous group. Administration-related reactions occurred in 73 patients (35%) in the intravenous group and 95 (48%) patients in the subcutaneous group (mainly grade 1 or 2 local injection-site reactions). Intravenous and subcutaneous rituximab had similar efficacy and safety profiles, and no new safety concerns were noted.

"Immunosuppressive therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome: a prospective randomized multicenter phase III trial comparing antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine with best supportive care--SAKK 33/99. Immunosuppressive treatment is reported to improve cytopenia in some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Combined antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA) is most effective in patients with immune-mediated marrow failure. This trial was designed to assess the impact of immunosuppression on hematopoiesis, transfusion requirements, transformation, and survival in patients with MDS randomly assigned to 15 mg/kg of horse ATG for 5 days and oral CSA for 180 days (ATG+CSA) or best supportive care (BSC), stratified by treatment center and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk score. Primary end point was best hematologic response at 6 months. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤ 2 and transfusion dependency of less than 2 years in duration. Between 2000 and 2006, 45 patients received ATG+CSA (median age, 62 years; range, 23 to 75 years; 56% men) and 43 patients received BSC (median age, 65 years; range, 24 to 76 years; 81% men). IPSS score was low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, high, and not evaluable in eight, 24, seven, one, and five patients on ATG+CSA, respectively, and eight, 25, five, zero, and five patients on BSC, respectively. Refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) -I, RAEB-II, and hypoplastic disease were present in 21, six, nine, zero, and nine patients on ATG+CSA, respectively, and 18, eight, 11, two, and four patients on BSC, respectively.

"Short regimen of rituximab plus lenalidomide in follicular lymphoma patients in need of first-line therapy. The SAKK 35/10 phase 2 trial, developed by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research and the Nordic Lymphoma Group, compared the activity of rituximab vs rituximab plus lenalidomide in untreated follicular lymphoma patients in need of systemic therapy. Patients were randomized to rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1 of weeks 1-4 and repeated during weeks 12-15 in responding patients) or rituximab (same schedule) in combination with lenalidomide (15 mg orally daily for 18 weeks). Primary end point was complete response (CR)/unconfirmed CR (CRu) rate at 6 months. In total, 77 patients were allocated to rituximab monotherapy and 77 to the combination (47% poor-risk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score in each arm). A significantly higher CR/CRu rate at 6 months was documented in the combination arm by the investigators (36%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-48% vs 25%; 95% CI, 16%-36%) and confirmed by an independent response review of computed tomography scans only (61%; 95% CI, 49%-72% vs 36%; 95% CI, 26%-48%). After a median follow-up of 4 years, significantly higher 30-month CR/CRu rates and longer progression-free survival (PFS) and time to next treatment (TTNT) were observed for the combination. Overall survival (OS) rates were similar in both arms (≥90%). Toxicity grade ≥3 was more common in the combination arm (56% vs 22% of patients), mainly represented by neutropenia (23% vs 7%). Addition of lenalidomide to rituximab significantly improved CR/CRu rates, PFS, and TTNT, with expected higher, but manageable toxicity. The excellent OS in both arms suggests that chemotherapy-free strategies should be further explored.

"Randomized phase II study of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: results from the SALUTE trial. Because of promising efficacy signals in single-arm studies, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized phase II trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of adding bevacizumab to first-line standard chemotherapy for treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients with SCLC were randomly assigned to receive bevacizumab or placebo, with cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide, for four cycles followed by single-agent bevacizumab or placebo until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to the bevacizumab group and 50 to the placebo group; 69% versus 66%, respectively, completed four cycles of therapy. Median PFS was higher in the bevacizumab group (5.5 months) than in the placebo group (4.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.86). Median overall survival (OS) was similar for both groups (9.4 v 10.9 months for bevacizumab and placebo groups, respectively), with an HR of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.66 to 2.04). Overall response rates were 58% (95% CI, 43% to 71%) for the bevacizumab group and 48% (95% CI, 34% to 62%) for the placebo group. Median duration of response was 4.7 months for the bevacizumab group and 3.2 months for the placebo group. In the bevacizumab and placebo groups, 75% versus 60% of patients, respectively, experienced one or more grade 3 or higher adverse events. No new or unexpected safety signals for bevacizumab were observed. The addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide for treatment of extensive-stage SCLC improved PFS, with an acceptable toxicity profile.

"Phase III randomized study of taselisib or placebo with fulvestrant in estrogen receptor-positive, PIK3CA-mutant, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer: the SANDPIPER trial. The phase III SANDPIPER study assessed taselisib (GDC-0032), a potent, selective PI3K inhibitor, plus fulvestrant in estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, PIK3CA-mutant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Postmenopausal women with disease recurrence/progression during/after an aromatase inhibitor were randomized 2 : 1 to receive taselisib (4 mg; taselisib arm) or placebo (placebo arm) plus fulvestrant (500 mg). Stratification factors were visceral disease, endocrine sensitivity, and geographic region. Patients with PIK3CA-mutant tumors (central cobas® PIK3CA Mutation Test) were randomized separately from those without detectable mutations. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (INV-PFS) in patients with PIK3CA-mutant tumors. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, clinical benefit rate, duration of objective response, PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR-PFS), safety, and time to deterioration in health-related quality of life. The PIK3CA-mutant intention-to-treat population comprised 516 patients (placebo arm: n = 176; taselisib arm: n = 340). INV-PFS was significantly improved in the taselisib {7.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.26-9.07]} versus placebo arm (5.4 months [95% CI, 3.68-7.29]) (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.89; P = 0.0037) and confirmed by BICR-PFS (HR 0.66). Secondary endpoints, including objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, and duration of objective response, showed consistent improvements in the taselisib arm. Safety was assessed in all randomized patients who received at least one dose of taselisib/placebo or fulvestrant regardless of PIK3CA-mutation status (n = 629). Serious adverse events were lower in the placebo versus taselisib arm (8.9% versus 32.0%). There were more discontinuations (placebo arm: 2.3%; taselisib arm: 16.8%) and dose reductions (placebo arm: 2.3%; taselisib arm: 36.5%) in the taselisib arm.

"Surufatinib in advanced extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (SANET-ep): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study. Therapeutic options for advanced neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are limited. We investigated the efficacy and safety of surufatinib (HMPL-012, sulfatinib) in patients with extrapancreatic NETs. SANET-ep was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial undertaken at 24 hospitals across China. Patients (aged 18 years or older) with unresectable or metastatic, well differentiated, extrapancreatic NETs, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and progression on no more than two types of previous systemic regimens were enrolled. Patients were centrally randomly assigned (2:1) using stratified block randomisation (block size 3) via an interactive web response system to receive oral surufatinib at 300 mg per day or matching placebo. Randomisation was stratified by tumour origin, pathological grade, and previous treatment. Patients, investigators, research staff and the sponsor study team were masked to treatment allocation. Crossover to the surufatinib group was allowed for patients in the placebo group at disease progression. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, which was analysed in the intention-to-treat population. A preplanned interim analysis was done at 70% of predicted progression-free survival events. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02588170. Follow-up is ongoing. Between Dec 9, 2015, and March 31, 2019, 198 patients were randomly assigned to surufatinib (n=129) or placebo (n=69). Median follow-up was 13·8 months (95% CI 11·1-16·7) in the surufatinib group and 16·6 months (9·2-not calculable) in the placebo group. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9·2 months (95% CI 7·4-11·1) in the surufatinib group versus 3·8 months (3·7-5·7) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·33; 95% CI 0·22-0·50; p<0·0001). As the trial met the predefined criteria for early discontinuation of the study at the interim analysis, the study was terminated early, as recommended by the independent data monitoring committee. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were hypertension (47 [36%] of 129 patients in the surufatinib group vs nine [13%] of 68 patients in the placebo group) and proteinuria (25 [19%] vs zero). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 32 (25%) of 129 patients in the surufatinib group and nine (13%) of 68 patients in the placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in three patients in the surufatinib group (disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatic encephalopathy, liver injury, and death with unknown reason) and one patient in the placebo group (cachexia and respiratory failure). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients given surufatinib compared with patients given placebo, and surufatinib has a favourable benefit-to-risk profile in patients with progressive, advanced, well differentiated extrapancreatic NETs. Our results suggest that surufatinib might be a new treatment option for this population.

"Randomized Double-Blind Phase II Study of Regorafenib in Patients With Metastatic Osteosarcoma. SARC024 is a phase II clinical trial of the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in specific sarcoma subtypes, including advanced osteosarcoma. We hypothesized that regorafenib would improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with sarcoma and report the results of the osteosarcoma cohort. This trial enrolled patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma with measurable disease by RECIST who had received at least one prior line of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to regorafenib or placebo. Crossover was allowed at time of disease progression. PFS was the primary end point of the study, which was powered to detect a difference of at least 3 months in median PFS. Forty-two patients from 12 centers were enrolled between September 2014 and May 2018. Median age was 37 years (range, 18 to 76 years). Patients had received an average of 2.3 prior therapy regimens. Ten patients receiving placebo crossed over to active drug at time of progression. Study enrollment was stopped early, after a data safety monitoring committee review. Median PFS was significantly improved with regorafenib versus placebo: 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.0 to 7.6 months) versus 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8 months), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.85; <i>P</i> = .017). In the context of the crossover design, there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival.

"Erlotinib as maintenance treatment in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 study. First-line chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is usually limited to four to six cycles. Maintenance therapy can delay progression and prolong survival. The oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitor erlotinib has proven efficacy and tolerability in second-line NSCLC. We designed the phase 3, placebo-controlled Sequential Tarceva in Unresectable NSCLC (SATURN; BO18192) study to assess use of erlotinib as maintenance therapy in patients with non-progressive disease following first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Between December, 2005, and May, 2008, 1949 patients were included in the run-in phase (four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy). At the end of the run-in phase, 889 patients who did not have progressive disease were entered into the main study, and were randomly allocated using a 1:1 adaptive randomisation method through a third-party interactive voice response system to receive erlotinib (150 mg/day; n=438) or placebo (n=451) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified by EGFR immunohistochemistry status, stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, smoking history, and region. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) in all analysable patients irrespective of EGFR status, and PFS in patients whose tumours had EGFR protein overexpression, as determined by immunohistochemistry. This study is registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00556712. 884 patients were analysable for PFS; 437 in the erlotinib group and 447 in the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 11.4 months for the erlotinib group and 11.5 months for the placebo group, median PFS was significantly longer with erlotinib than with placebo: 12.3 weeks for patients in the erlotinib group versus 11.1 weeks for those in the placebo group (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62-0.82; p<0.0001). PFS was also significantly longer in patients with EGFR-positive immunohistochemistry who were treated with erlotinib (n=307) compared with EGFR-positive patients given placebo (n=311; median PFS 12.3 weeks in the erlotinib group vs 11.1 weeks in the placebo group; HR 0.69, 0.58-0.82; p<0.0001). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were rash (37 [9%] of 443 patients in the erlotinib group vs none of 445 in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (seven [2%] of 443 patients vs none of 445). Serious adverse events were reported in 47 patients (11%) on erlotinib compared with 34 patients (8%) on placebo. The most common serious adverse event was pneumonia (seven cases [2%] with erlotinib and four [<1%] with placebo). Maintenance therapy with erlotinib for patients with NSCLC is well tolerated and significantly prolongs PFS compared with placebo. First-line maintenance with erlotinib could be considered in patients who do not progress after four cycles of chemotherapy.

"Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing the Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of SB3 (Trastuzumab Biosimilar) and Reference Trastuzumab in Patients Treated With Neoadjuvant Therapy for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Early Breast Cancer. Purpose This phase III study compared SB3, a trastuzumab (TRZ) biosimilar, with reference TRZ in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02149524). Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant SB3 or TRZ for eight cycles concurrently with chemotherapy (four cycles of docetaxel followed by four cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) followed by surgery, and then 10 cycles of adjuvant SB3 or TRZ. The primary objective was comparison of breast pathologic complete response (bpCR) rate in the per-protocol set; equivalence was declared if the 95% CI of the ratio was within 0.785 to 1.546 or the 95% CI of the difference was within ± 13%. Secondary end points included comparisons of total pathologic complete response rate, overall response rate, event-free survival, overall survival, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Results Eight hundred patients were included in the per-protocol set (SB3, n = 402; TRZ, n = 398). The bpCR rates were 51.7% and 42.0% with SB3 and TRZ, respectively. The adjusted ratio of bpCR was 1.259 (95% CI, 1.085 to 1.460), which was within the predefined equivalence margins. The adjusted difference was 10.70% (95% CI, 4.13% to 17.26%), with the lower limit contained within and the upper limit outside the equivalence margin. The total pathologic complete response rates were 45.8% and 35.8% and the overall response rates were 96.3% and 91.2% with SB3 and TRZ, respectively. Overall, 96.6% and 95.2% of patients experienced one or more adverse event, 10.5% and 10.7% had a serious adverse event, and 0.7% and 0.0% had antidrug antibodies (up to cycle 9) with SB3 and TRZ, respectively. Conclusion Equivalence for efficacy was demonstrated between SB3 and TRZ on the basis of the ratio of bpCR rates.

"Isolated Hepatic Perfusion With Melphalan for Patients With Isolated Uveal Melanoma Liver Metastases: A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label, Phase III Trial (the SCANDIUM Trial). About half of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma present with isolated liver metastasis, in whom the median survival is 6-12 months. The few systemic treatment options available only moderately prolong survival. Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with melphalan is a regional treatment option, but prospective efficacy and safety data are lacking. In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, patients with previously untreated isolated liver metastases from uveal melanoma were randomly assigned to receive a one-time treatment with IHP with melphalan or best alternative care (control group). The primary end point was overall survival at 24 months. Here, we report the secondary outcomes of response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, progression-free survival (PFS), hepatic PFS (hPFS), and safety. Ninety-three patients were randomly assigned, and 87 patients were assigned to either IHP (n = 43) or a control group receiving the investigator's choice of treatment (n = 44). In the control group, 49% received chemotherapy, 39% immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 9% locoregional treatment other than IHP. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rates (ORRs) were 40% versus 4.5% in the IHP and control groups, respectively (<i>P</i> < .0001). The median PFS was 7.4 months versus 3.3 months (<i>P</i> < .0001), with a hazard ratio of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.36), and the median hPFS was 9.1 months versus 3.3 months (<i>P</i> < .0001), both favoring the IHP arm. There were 11 treatment-related serious adverse events in the IHP group compared with seven in the control group. There was one treatment-related death in the IHP group. IHP treatment resulted in superior ORR, hPFS, and PFS compared with best alternative care in previously untreated patients with isolated liver metastases from primary uveal melanoma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36940407/,36940407,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion compared to Investigator's choice of therapy when used to treat Uveal melanoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion versus Investigator's choice of therapy in treating Uveal melanoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion and Investigator's choice of therapy for managing Uveal melanoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion versus Investigator's choice of therapy in treating Uveal melanoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion when compared with Investigator's choice of therapy for Uveal melanoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion in comparison to Investigator's choice of therapy for the treatment of Uveal melanoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion compared to Investigator's choice of therapy for addressing Uveal melanoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion and Investigator's choice of therapy in the treatment of Uveal melanoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion against Investigator's choice of therapy for managing Uveal melanoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion compared to Investigator's choice of therapy in treating Uveal melanoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion contrasted with Investigator's choice of therapy in relation to Uveal melanoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion versus Investigator's choice of therapy for treating Uveal melanoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion and Investigator's choice of therapy in treating Uveal melanoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion as opposed to Investigator's choice of therapy in managing Uveal melanoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion compared to Investigator's choice of therapy in the context of Uveal melanoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion compares to Investigator's choice of therapy in terms of effectiveness for Uveal melanoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion in relation to Investigator's choice of therapy for the treatment of Uveal melanoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion versus Investigator's choice of therapy for managing Uveal melanoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion's efficacy in comparison with Investigator's choice of therapy in treating Uveal melanoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Melphalan isolated hepatic perfusion against Investigator's choice of therapy regarding Uveal melanoma.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01785316,"{""36940407"": ""Roger Olofsson Bagge|Axel Nelson|Amir Shafazand|Charlotta All-Eriksson|Christian Cahlin|Nils Elander|Hildur Helgadottir|Jens Folke Kiilgaard|Sara Kinhult|Ingrid Ljuslinder|Jan Mattsson|Magnus Rizell|Malin Sternby Eilard|Gustav J Ullenhag|Jonas A Nilsson|Lars Ny|Per Lindnér""}",2013-06-15,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Chemotherapy
"3 versus 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combination therapy for colorectal cancer (SCOT): an international, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial. 6 months of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is usually given as adjuvant treatment for stage 3 colorectal cancer. We investigated whether 3 months of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy would be non-inferior to the usual 6 months of treatment. The SCOT study was an international, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done at 244 centres. Patients aged 18 years or older with high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer underwent central randomisation with minimisation for centre, choice of regimen, sex, disease site, N stage, T stage, and the starting dose of capecitabine. Patients were assigned (1:1) to receive 3 months or 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens could consist of CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) or FOLFOX (bolus and infused fluorouracil with oxaliplatin). The regimen was selected before randomisation in accordance with choices of the patient and treating physician. The primary study endpoint was disease-free survival and the non-inferiority margin was a hazard ratio of 1·13. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who started study treatment. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN59757862, and follow-up is continuing. 6088 patients underwent randomisation between March 27, 2008, and Nov 29, 2013. The intended treatment was FOLFOX in 1981 patients and CAPOX in 4107 patients. 3044 patients were assigned to 3 month group and 3044 were assigned to 6 month group. Nine patients in the 3 month group and 14 patients in the 6 month group did not consent for their data to be used, leaving 3035 patients in the 3 month group and 3030 patients in the 6 month group for the intention-to-treat analyses. At the cutoff date for analysis, there had been 1482 disease-free survival events, with 740 in the 3 month group and 742 in the 6 month group. 3 year disease-free survival was 76·7% (95% CI 75·1-78·2) for the 3 month group and 77·1% (75·6-78·6) for the 6 month group, giving a hazard ratio of 1·006 (0·909-1·114, test for non-inferiority p=0·012), significantly below the non-inferiority margin. Peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or worse was more common in the 6 month group (237 [58%] of 409 patients for the subset with safety data) than in the 3 month group (103 [25%] of 420) and was long-lasting and associated with worse quality of life. 1098 serious adverse events were reported (492 reports in the 3 month group and 606 reports in the 6 month group) and 32 treatment-related deaths occurred (16 in each group). In the whole study population, 3 months of oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy was non-inferior to 6 months of the same therapy for patients with high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer and was associated with reduced toxicity and improved quality of life. Despite the fact the study was underpowered, these data suggest that a shorter duration leads to similar survival outcomes with better quality of life and thus might represent a new standard of care.

"Synchronous versus sequential chemo-radiotherapy in patients with early stage breast cancer (SECRAB): A randomised, phase III, trial. The optimal sequence of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast cancer is unknown. SECRAB assesses whether local control can be improved without increased toxicity. SECRAB was a prospective, open-label, multi-centre, phase III trial comparing synchronous to sequential chemo-radiotherapy, conducted in 48 UK centres. Patients with invasive, early stage breast cancer were eligible. Randomisation (performed using random permuted block assignment) was stratified by centre, axillary surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy boost. Permitted chemotherapy regimens included CMF and anthracycline-CMF. Synchronous radiotherapy was administered between cycles two and three for CMF or five and six for anthracycline-CMF. Sequential radiotherapy was delivered on chemotherapy completion. Radiotherapy schedules included 40 Gy/15F over three weeks, and 50 Gy/25F over five weeks. The primary outcome was local recurrence at five and ten years, defined as time to local recurrence, and analysed by intention to treat. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00003893. Between 02-July-1998 and 25-March-2004, 2297 patients were recruited (1150 synchronous and 1146 sequential). Baseline characteristics were balanced. With 10.2 years median follow-up, the ten-year local recurrence rates were 4.6% and 7.1% in the synchronous and sequential arms respectively (hazard ratio (HR) 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.90; p = 0.012). In a planned sub-group analysis of anthracycline-CMF, the ten-year local recurrence rates difference were 3.5% versus 6.7% respectively (HR 0.48 95% CI: 0.26-0.88; p = 0.018). There was no significant difference in overall or disease-free survival. 24% of patients on the synchronous arm suffered moderate/severe acute skin reactions compared to 15% on the sequential arm (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in late adverse effects apart from telangiectasia (p = 0.03). Synchronous chemo-radiotherapy significantly improved local recurrence rates. This was delivered with an acceptable increase in acute toxicity. The greatest benefit of synchronous chemo-radiation was in patients treated with anthracycline-CMF.

"Locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer treated with intermittent androgen monotherapy or maximal androgen blockade: results from a randomised phase 3 study by the South European Uroncological Group. Few randomised studies have compared antiandrogen intermittent hormonal therapy (IHT) with continuous maximal androgen blockade (MAB) therapy for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). To determine whether overall survival (OS) on IHT (cyproterone acetate; CPA) is noninferior to OS on continuous MAB. This phase 3 randomised trial compared IHT and continuous MAB in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PCa. During induction, patients received CPA 200 mg/d for 2 wk and then monthly depot injections of a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; triptoreline 11.25 mg) analogue plus CPA 200 mg/d. Patients whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was <4 ng/ml after 3 mo of induction treatment were randomised to the IHT arm (stopped treatment and restarted on CPA 300 mg/d monotherapy if PSA rose to ≥20 ng/ml or they were symptomatic) or the continuous arm (CPA 200 mg/d plus monthly LHRH analogue). Primary outcome measurement was OS. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific survival, time to subjective or objective progression, and quality of life. Time off therapy in the intermittent arm was recorded. We recruited 1045 patients, of which 918 responded to induction therapy and were randomised (462 to IHT and 456 to continuous MAB). OS was similar between groups (p=0.25), and noninferiority of IHT was demonstrated (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.07). There was a trend for an interaction between PSA and treatment (p=0.05), favouring IHT over continuous therapy in patients with PSA ≤1 ng/ml (HR: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02). Men treated with IHT reported better sexual function. Among the 462 patients on IHT, 50% and 28% of patients were off therapy for ≥2.5 yr or >5 yr, respectively, after randomisation. The main limitation is that the length of time for the trial to mature means that other therapies are now available. A second limitation is that T3 patients may now profit from watchful waiting instead of androgen-deprivation therapy. Noninferiority of IHT in terms of survival and its association with better sexual activity than continuous therapy suggest that IHT should be considered for use in routine clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23582949/,23582949,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of ADT compared to Intermittent ADT when used to treat Prostate cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of ADT versus Intermittent ADT in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of ADT and Intermittent ADT for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of ADT versus Intermittent ADT in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of ADT when compared with Intermittent ADT for Prostate cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of ADT in comparison to Intermittent ADT for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of ADT compared to Intermittent ADT for addressing Prostate cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of ADT and Intermittent ADT in the treatment of Prostate cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of ADT against Intermittent ADT for managing Prostate cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of ADT compared to Intermittent ADT in treating Prostate cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of ADT contrasted with Intermittent ADT in relation to Prostate cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of ADT versus Intermittent ADT for treating Prostate cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of ADT and Intermittent ADT in treating Prostate cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of ADT as opposed to Intermittent ADT in managing Prostate cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of ADT compared to Intermittent ADT in the context of Prostate cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how ADT compares to Intermittent ADT in terms of effectiveness for Prostate cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of ADT in relation to Intermittent ADT for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of ADT versus Intermittent ADT for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of ADT's efficacy in comparison with Intermittent ADT in treating Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of ADT against Intermittent ADT regarding Prostate cancer.,3,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00363285,"{""23582949"": ""Fernando Calais da Silva|Fernando Manuel Calais da Silva|Frederico Gonçalves|Américo Santos|Jan Kliment|Peter Whelan|Tim Oliver|Nicos Antoniou|Spiro Pastidis|Anton Marques Queimadelos|Chris Robertson""}",2003-01,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Unknown
"SFOP OS94: a randomised trial comparing preoperative high-dose methotrexate plus doxorubicin to high-dose methotrexate plus etoposide and ifosfamide in osteosarcoma patients. The SFOP-OS94 randomised multi-centre trial was designed to determine whether preoperative chemotherapy regimen combining high-dose methotrexate courses and etoposide-ifosfamide could improve the proportion of good histologic response (5% viable cells) compared to a regimen based on high-dose methotrexate and doxorubicin, in children/adolescents with localised high-grade limb osteosarcoma. Postoperative chemotherapy was adapted to the histologic response. Overall, 234 patients were randomised between 1994 and 2001. There were 56% good responders in the etoposide-ifosfamide arm versus 39% in the doxorubicin arm (p-value=0.009). With a median follow-up of 77 months, the 5-year event-free survival of the entire population was 62%, slightly greater in the etoposide-ifosfamide arm than in the doxorubicin arm, but the difference was not significant (Hazard Ratio: HR=0.71, 95%CI: 0.5-1.06, p-value=0.09). Five-year overall survival of the entire population was 76%, similar in both arms (HR=0.95, 95%CI: 0.6-1.6, p-value=0.85). Toxicity was manageable with different acute toxicity profiles between treatment arms. No acute toxicity related death was reported. About 43% of the patients in the etoposide-ifosfamide arm were event-free at 3 years without having received any doxorubicin or cisplatin, thus avoiding the risk of long-term cardio- and ototoxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267204/,17267204,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of M-EI compared to MA when used to treat Osteosarcoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of M-EI versus MA in treating Osteosarcoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of M-EI and MA for managing Osteosarcoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of M-EI versus MA in treating Osteosarcoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of M-EI when compared with MA for Osteosarcoma?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of M-EI in comparison to MA for the treatment of Osteosarcoma.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of M-EI compared to MA for addressing Osteosarcoma.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of M-EI and MA in the treatment of Osteosarcoma?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of M-EI against MA for managing Osteosarcoma.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of M-EI compared to MA in treating Osteosarcoma.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of M-EI contrasted with MA in relation to Osteosarcoma?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of M-EI versus MA for treating Osteosarcoma.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of M-EI and MA in treating Osteosarcoma?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of M-EI as opposed to MA in managing Osteosarcoma.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of M-EI compared to MA in the context of Osteosarcoma.,What option most accurately summarizes how M-EI compares to MA in terms of effectiveness for Osteosarcoma?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of M-EI in relation to MA for the treatment of Osteosarcoma.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of M-EI versus MA for managing Osteosarcoma?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of M-EI's efficacy in comparison with MA in treating Osteosarcoma.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of M-EI against MA regarding Osteosarcoma.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00180908,"{""17267204"": ""Marie-Cécile Le Deley|Jean-Marc Guinebretière|Jean-Claude Gentet|Hélène Pacquement|Fabienne Pichon|Perrine Marec-Bérard|Natacha Entz-Werlé|Claudine Schmitt|Laurence Brugières|Daniel Vanel|Noëlle Dupoüy|Marie-Dominique Tabone|Chantal Kalifa|Société Française d'Oncologie Pédiatrique (SFOP)""}",1994-06,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy|Chemotherapy
"A randomized study comparing yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) and high-dose BEAM chemotherapy versus BEAM alone as the conditioning regimen before autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with aggressive lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard therapy for refractory/relapsed aggressive lymphoma. In the era of rituximab-containing frontline regimens, it is becoming more challenging to salvage patients in this setting, and novel approaches are required. This is a randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of standard-dose ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) combined with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (Z-BEAM) and ASCT in refractory/relapsed aggressive lymphoma. Forty-three patients with CD20(+) -aggressive lymphoma were randomized to a treatment arm (Z-BEAM, n = 22) or control arm (BEAM alone, n = 21). Ibritumomab tiuxetan was given at 0.4 mCi/kg on day -14 before ASCT. Patient characteristics, engraftment kinetics, and toxicity profile were similar between the 2 groups. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients was 48% (95% confidence interval, 32%-64%): 59% and 37% after Z-BEAM and BEAM alone, respectively (P = .2). Multivariate analysis identified advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 8.3; P = .001), high-risk disease (relapse within 12 months of diagnosis and/or secondary International Prognostic Index >2; HR, 2.8; P = .04), positive positron emission tomography-computed tomography pretransplant (HR, 2.4; P = .07), and BEAM alone (HR, 2.8; P = .03) as poor prognostic factors. Intermediate-risk patients with 1 or 2 risk factors had better PFS with Z-BEAM compared with BEAM: 69% and 29%, respectively (P = .07). Two-year overall survival was 91% and 62% after Z-BEAM and BEAM, respectively (P = .05). Similar prognostic factors determined survival. The HR for BEAM alone in the multivariate analysis was 8.1 (P = .01).

"Ibrutinib plus Bendamustine and Rituximab in Untreated Mantle-Cell Lymphoma. Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may have clinical benefit when administered in combination with bendamustine and rituximab and followed by rituximab maintenance therapy in older patients with untreated mantle-cell lymphoma. We randomly assigned patients 65 years of age or older to receive ibrutinib (560 mg, administered orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects) or placebo, plus six cycles of bendamustine (90 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and rituximab (375 mg per square meter). Patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) received rituximab maintenance therapy, administered every 8 weeks for up to 12 additional doses. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by the investigators. Overall survival and safety were also assessed. Among 523 patients, 261 were randomly assigned to receive ibrutinib and 262 to receive placebo. At a median follow-up of 84.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 80.6 months in the ibrutinib group and 52.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.96; P = 0.01). The percentage of patients with a complete response was 65.5% in the ibrutinib group and 57.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.06). Overall survival was similar in the two groups. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events during treatment was 81.5% in the ibrutinib group and 77.3% in the placebo group.

"Bendamustine versus chlorambucil in treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in China: a randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, phase III clinical trial. Chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia and mainly affects the elderly. Chemoimmunotherapy still has a role in the standard frontline therapy for specific population. However, the clinical activity of bendamustine has not been investigated in unfit Chinese patients with CLL. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of bendamustine versus chlorambucil for untreated Chinese patients with Binet stage B/C CLL. In this multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, phase III trial, patients with previously untreated CLL were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive bendamustine or chlorambucil. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, the duration of response, and overall survival. Adverse events were recorded to evaluate safety. Of 158 screened patients, 147 were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive bendamustine (n = 72) or chlorambucil (n = 75). After a median follow-up of 25.6 months (IQR 12.5-27.7), 69.0% (95% CI, 56.9-79.5) of bendamustine-treated patients achieved objective response and 37.0% (95% CI, 26.0-49.1) of chlorambucil with a difference of 32.0% (95%CI: 16.6-47.5), demonstrating the superiority of bendamustine to chlorambucil (p < 0.001). The median progression-free survival was longer for bendamustine (16.5 months; 95% CI, 11.3-24.7) versus chlorambucil (9.6 months; 95% CI, 8.7-11.8; p < 0.001). A longer median duration of response was seen in those receiving bendamustine (19.2 months; 95% CI, 11.8-29.1) than chlorambucil (10.7 months; 95% CI, 5.6-13.6; p = 0.0018). Median overall survival was not reached in either group. Overall survival at 18 months was 88% for bendamustine versus 85% for chlorambucil. Most common adverse events in both groups were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In untreated Chinese patients with Binet stage B/C CLL, bendamustine induced the better objective response and resulted in longer progression-free survival than chlorambucil. Overall, these results validate the role of bendamustine as an effective and safe first-line therapy in this population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35031896/,35031896,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy compared to Chlorambucil monotherapy when used to treat Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy versus Chlorambucil monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy and Chlorambucil monotherapy for managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy versus Chlorambucil monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy when compared with Chlorambucil monotherapy for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy in comparison to Chlorambucil monotherapy for the treatment of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy compared to Chlorambucil monotherapy for addressing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy and Chlorambucil monotherapy in the treatment of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy against Chlorambucil monotherapy for managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy compared to Chlorambucil monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy contrasted with Chlorambucil monotherapy in relation to Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy versus Chlorambucil monotherapy for treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy and Chlorambucil monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy as opposed to Chlorambucil monotherapy in managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy compared to Chlorambucil monotherapy in the context of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,What option most accurately summarizes how Bendamustine monotherapy compares to Chlorambucil monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy in relation to Chlorambucil monotherapy for the treatment of Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Bendamustine monotherapy versus Chlorambucil monotherapy for managing Chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Bendamustine monotherapy's efficacy in comparison with Chlorambucil monotherapy in treating Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Bendamustine monotherapy against Chlorambucil monotherapy regarding Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01109264,"{""35031896"": ""Daobin Zhou|Wei Xu|Hongbing Ma|Chunting Zhao|Yu Hu|Yaozhong Zhao|Depei Wu|Xielan Zhao|Yanjuan He|Jinsong Yan|Chunsen Wang|Fanyi Meng|Jie Jin|Xiaohong Zhang|Kang Yu|Jianda Hu|Yue Lv""}",2010-03,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Unknown
"Reduction of postoperative chemotherapy in children with stage I intermediate-risk and anaplastic Wilms' tumour (SIOP 93-01 trial): a randomised controlled trial. Present treatment for Wilms' tumour is very successful. Now, efforts are aimed at reducing toxicity and burden of treatment by shortening schedules without loss of effectiveness. The objective of this randomised trial was to assess whether postoperative chemotherapy for patients with stage I intermediate-risk and anaplastic Wilms' tumour could be shortened to only 4 weeks from the standard 18 weeks, while maintaining equivalent event-free survival. Between June, 1993, and June, 2000, 410 patients were randomly assigned after four doses of vincristine plus one course of dactinomycin postoperatively either to stop further adjuvant chemotherapy (no further chemotherapy group, n=200), or to receive a further two courses of the same chemotherapy (standard group, n=210). Previous treatment consisted of chemotherapy before nephrectomy of four doses of vincristine and two courses of dactinomycin followed by surgical resection of the tumour. Eligible patients were at least 6 months old and had stage I tumours with either intermediate-risk histology or anaplasia. The primary endpoint of this equivalence trial was 2-year event-free survival. Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were done. By 2 years, 18 recurrences were reported in the standard group, and 22 in the no further chemotherapy group. Event-free survival was 91.4% (95% CI 87.5-95.2) for the no further chemotherapy group and 88.8% (84.3-93.2) for the standard group (difference=2.6%, upper 97.5% confidence limit 8.4%). The null hypothesis, that experimental treatment is less effective than standard treatment, could be rejected (p=0.008).

"Omission of doxorubicin from the treatment of stage II-III, intermediate-risk Wilms' tumour (SIOP WT 2001): an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial. Before this study started, the standard postoperative chemotherapy regimen for stage II-III Wilms' tumour pretreated with chemotherapy was to include doxorubicin. However, avoidance of doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity effects is important to improve long-term outcomes for childhood cancers that have excellent prognosis. We aimed to assess whether doxorubicin can be omitted safely from chemotherapy for stage II-III, histological intermediate-risk Wilms' tumour when a newly defined high-risk blastemal subtype was excluded from randomisation. For this international, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3, randomised SIOP WT 2001 trial, we recruited children aged 6 months to 18 years at the time of diagnosis of a primary renal tumour from 251 hospitals in 26 countries who had received 4 weeks of preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin D. Children with stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms' tumours assessed after delayed nephrectomy were randomly assigned (1:1) by a minimisation technique to receive vincristine 1·5 mg/m(2) at weeks 1-8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 27, plus actinomycin D 45 μg/kg every 3 weeks from week 2, either with five doses of doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) given every 6 weeks from week 2 (standard treatment) or without doxorubicin (experimental treatment). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of event-free survival at 2 years, analysed by intention to treat and a margin of 10%. Assessment of safety and adverse events included systematic monitoring of hepatic toxicity and cardiotoxicity. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2007-004591-39, and is closed to new participants. Between Nov 1, 2001, and Dec 16, 2009, we recruited 583 patients, 341 with stage II and 242 with stage III tumours, and randomly assigned 291 children to treatment including doxorubicin, and 292 children to treatment excluding doxorubicin. Median follow-up was 60·8 months (IQR 40·8-79·8). 2 year event-free survival was 92·6% (95% CI 89·6-95·7) for treatment including doxorubicin and 88·2% (84·5-92·1) for treatment excluding doxorubicin, a difference of 4·4% (95% CI 0·4-9·3) that did not exceed the predefined 10% margin. 5 year overall survival was 96·5% (94·3-98·8) for treatment including doxorubicin and 95·8% (93·3-98·4) for treatment excluding doxorubicin. Four children died from a treatment-related toxic effect; one (<1%) of 291 receiving treatment including doxorubicin died of sepsis, three (1%) of 292 receiving treatment excluding doxorubicin died of varicella, metabolic seizure, and sepsis during treatment for relapse. 17 patients (3%) had hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Cardiotoxic effects were reported in 15 (5%) of 291 children receiving treatment including doxorubicin. 12 children receiving treatment including doxorubicin, and ten children receiving treatment excluding doxorubicin, died, with the remaining deaths from tumour recurrence. Doxorubicin does not need to be included in treatment of stage II-III intermediate risk Wilms' tumour when the histological response to preoperative chemotherapy is incorporated into the risk stratification.

"Controlled trial of transfusions for silent cerebral infarcts in sickle cell anemia. Silent cerebral infarcts are the most common neurologic injury in children with sickle cell anemia and are associated with the recurrence of an infarct (stroke or silent cerebral infarct). We tested the hypothesis that the incidence of the recurrence of an infarct would be lower among children who underwent regular blood-transfusion therapy than among those who received standard care. In this randomized, single-blind clinical trial, we randomly assigned children with sickle cell anemia to receive regular blood transfusions (transfusion group) or standard care (observation group). Participants were between 5 and 15 years of age, with no history of stroke and with one or more silent cerebral infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging and a neurologic examination showing no abnormalities corresponding to these lesions. The primary end point was the recurrence of an infarct, defined as a stroke or a new or enlarged silent cerebral infarct. A total of 196 children (mean age, 10 years) were randomly assigned to the observation or transfusion group and were followed for a median of 3 years. In the transfusion group, 6 of 99 children (6%) had an end-point event (1 had a stroke, and 5 had new or enlarged silent cerebral infarcts). In the observation group, 14 of 97 children (14%) had an end-point event (7 had strokes, and 7 had new or enlarged silent cerebral infarcts). The incidence of the primary end point in the transfusion and observation groups was 2.0 and 4.8 events, respectively, per 100 years at risk, corresponding to an incidence rate ratio of 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.99; P=0.04). Regular blood-transfusion therapy significantly reduced the incidence of the recurrence of cerebral infarct in children with sickle cell anemia.

"Salvage chemotherapy for pretreated gastric cancer: a randomized phase III trial comparing chemotherapy plus best supportive care with best supportive care alone. When designing this trial, there was no evidence that salvage chemotherapy (SLC) in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) resulted in substantial prolongation of survival when compared with best supportive care (BSC). However, SLC is often offered to pretreated patients with AGC for anecdotal reasons. Patients with AGC with one or two prior chemotherapy regimens involving both fluoropyrimidines and platinum and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 0 or 1 were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1 to SLC plus BSC or BSC alone. Choice of SLC-either docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks-was left to the discretion of investigators. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Median OS was 5.3 months among 133 patients in the SLC arm and 3.8 months among 69 patients in the BSC arm (hazard ratio, 0.657; 95% CI, 0.485 to 0.891; one-sided P = .007). OS benefit for SLC was consistent in most of the prospectively defined subgroups, including age, PS, number of prior treatments, metastatic sites, hemoglobin levels, and response to prior chemotherapy. SLC was generally well tolerated, and adverse events were similar in the SLC and BSC arms. We found no median OS difference between docetaxel and irinotecan (5.2 v 6.5 months; P = .116). To our knowledge, this is the largest phase III trial comparing SLC plus BSC with BSC alone in AGC.

"Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin with or without erlotinib in advanced biliary-tract cancer: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study. Combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and a platinum-based agent is regarded as a standard treatment for patients with advanced biliary-tract cancer. Results of phase 2 trials of single-agent erlotinib in biliary-tract cancer and of gemcitabine plus erlotinib in pancreatic cancer have shown modest benefits. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin plus erlotinib versus chemotherapy alone for advanced biliary-tract cancer. In this open label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients (in a 1:1 ratio) with metastatic biliary-tract cancer (cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, or ampulla of Vater cancer) to receive either first-line treatment with chemotherapy alone (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 2) or chemotherapy plus erlotinib (100 mg daily). Treatment was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Randomisation was done centrally (stratified by participating centre and presence of measurable lesion). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01149122. 133 patients were randomly assigned to the chemotherapy alone group and 135 to the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group. The groups were balanced except for a higher proportion of patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the group given erlotinib than in the chemotherapy alone group (96 [71%] patients vs 84 [63%]). Median progression-free survival was 4·2 months (95% CI 2·7-5·7) in the chemotherapy alone group and 5·8 months (95% CI 4·6-7·0) in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·80, 95% CI 0·61-1·03; p=0·087). Significantly more patients had an objective response in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group than in the chemotherapy alone group (40 patients vs 21 patients; p=0·005), but median overall survival was the same in both groups (9·5 months [95% CI 7·5-11·5] in the chemotherapy alone group and 9·5 months [7·6-11·4] in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group; HR 0·93, 0·69-1·25; p=0·611). All-cause deaths within 30 days of random assignment occurred in one (1%) of the patients in the chemotherapy alone group and in four (3%) of those in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was febrile neutropenia (eight [6%] patients in the chemotherapy alone group and six [4%] in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group). No patient died of treatment-related causes during the study. Subgroup analyses by primary site of disease showed that for patients with cholangiocarcinoma, the addition of erlotinib to chemotherapy significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (5·9 months [95% CI 4·7-7·1] for chemotherapy plus erlotinib vs 3·0 months [1·1-4·9] for chemotherapy alone; HR 0·73, 95% CI 0·53-1·00; p=0·049).

"S-1 plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer (SOLAR): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. S-1 plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin showed promising efficacy for treatment of advanced gastric cancer in a randomised phase 2 study. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral TAS-118 (S-1 plus leucovorin) and oxaliplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer. We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in 62 centres across Japan and South Korea. Patients aged 20 years or older, with a histologically confirmed advanced gastric cancer with negative or unknown HER2 status, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, measurable or evaluable metastatic lesions, and no previous treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system using the minimisation method, stratified by performance status, presence of a measurable lesion, and country, to receive TAS-118 (S-1 40-60 mg and leucovorin 25 mg orally twice daily for 7 days) plus oxaliplatin (85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1) every 2 weeks, or S-1 (40-60 mg orally twice daily) for 21 days plus cisplatin (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on day 1 or 8) every 5 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival in patients who had advanced gastric cancer with measurable or evaluable metastatic lesions and who received the study drug. Safety was assessed in all patients who received the study drug. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02322593. Between Jan 28, 2015, and Dec 5, 2016, 711 patients were randomised to TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin (n=356) or S-1 plus cisplatin (n=355). 11 untreated patients and 19 ineligible patients were excluded from the primary analysis (TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group n=347, S-1 plus cisplatin group n=334) following recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee. After median follow-up of 26·0 months (IQR 22·0-32·8), median overall survival was 16·0 months (95% CI 13·8-18·3) in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and 15·1 months (95% CI 13·6-16·4) in the S-1 plus cisplatin group (hazard ratio 0·83, 95% CI 0·69-0·99; p=0·039). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the 352 patients in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and the 348 patients in the S-1 plus cisplatin group were anaemia (56 [16%] vs 64 [18%]), neutropenia (54 [15%] vs 88 [25%]), decreased appetite (53 [15%] vs 46 [13%]), diarrhoea (33 [9%] vs 15 [4%]), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (30 [9%] vs one [<1%]). Serious adverse events were observed in 155 (44%) of 352 patients in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and 159 (46%) of 348 patients in the S-1 plus cisplatin group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group (pulmonary tuberculosis and viral pneumonia). TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin showed a clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy compared with S-1 plus cisplatin, and could be considered a new first-line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer in Asian patients.

"Multicenter phase III trial of S-1 and cisplatin versus S-1 and oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer (SOPP trial). In East Asia, S-1 plus cisplatin (SP) is one of the standard first-line chemotherapy regimens for metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer (MRGC). Oxaliplatin is generally less toxic and more convenient to administer than cisplatin. This was a multicenter, phase III study assessing whether S-1/oxaliplatin (SOX) was non-inferior/superior to SP in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). Patients with MRGC were randomized 1:1 to receive either SOX (S-1 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day on days 1-14; oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1; every 3 weeks) or SP (S-1 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day on days 1-14; cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1; every 3 weeks [SP3]). Between October 2012 and October 2014, 338 patients were randomized. The median age was 56 years, and 51% of patients had measurable lesions. SOX was significantly non-inferior but not superior to SP3 in terms of PFS [median 5.6 versus 5.7 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-1.07]. In patients with measurable disease, objective response rates were similar between SOX and SP3 (58% versus 60%). Overall, the survival in both groups did not differ (median 12.9 versus 11.4 months; HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.66-1.11). Treatment was well tolerated in both arms. Anemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and oral mucositis were more common with SP3. In contrast, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, and peripheral neuropathy were more common with SOX. SOX was non-inferior to SP3. The two regimens were well tolerated with different toxicity profiles. The SOX regimen can be recommended as a first-line treatment for MRGC.

"Addition of sorafenib versus placebo to standard therapy in patients aged 60 years or younger with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (SORAML): a multicentre, phase 2, randomised controlled trial. Preclinical data and results from non-randomised trials suggest that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib might be an effective drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib versus placebo in addition to standard chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done at 25 sites in Germany. We enrolled patients aged 18-60 years with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia who had a WHO clinical performance score 0-2, adequate renal and liver function, no cardiac comorbidities, and no recent trauma or operation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two cycles of induction therapy with daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) on days 3-5) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) on days 1-7), followed by three cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy (3 g/m(2) twice daily on days 1, 3, and 5) plus either sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo on days 10-19 of induction cycles 1 and 2, from day 8 of each consolidation, and as maintenance for 12 months. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was scheduled for all intermediate-risk patients with a sibling donor and for all high-risk patients with a matched donor in first remission. Computer-generated randomisation was done in blocks. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, with an event defined as either primary treatment failure or relapse or death, assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. We report the final analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00893373, and the EU Clinical Trials Register (2008-004968-40). Between March 27, 2009, and Nov 28, 2011, 276 patients were enrolled and randomised, of whom nine did not receive study medication. 267 patients were included in the primary analysis (placebo, n=133; sorafenib, n=134). With a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 35·5-38·1), median event-free survival was 9 months (95% CI 4-15) in the placebo group versus 21 months (9-32) in the sorafenib group, corresponding to a 3-year event-free survival of 22% (95% CI 13-32) in the placebo group versus 40% (29-51) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·64, 95% CI; 0·45-0·91; p=0·013). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups were fever (71 [53%] in the placebo group vs 73 [54%] in the sorafenib group), infections (55 [41%] vs 46 [34%]), pneumonia (21 [16%] vs 20 [14%]), and pain (13 [10%] vs 15 [11%]). Grade 3 or worse adverse events that were significantly more common in the sorafenib group than the placebo group were fever (relative risk [RR] 1·54, 95% CI 1·04-2·28), diarrhoea (RR 7·89, 2·94-25·2), bleeding (RR 3·75, 1·5-10·0), cardiac events (RR 3·46, 1·15-11·8), hand-foot-skin reaction (only in sorafenib group), and rash (RR 4·06, 1·25-15·7). In patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger, the addition of sorafenib to standard chemotherapy has antileukaemic efficacy but also increased toxicity. Our findings suggest that kinase inhibitors could be a useful addition to curative treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia. Overall survival after long-term follow-up and strategies to reduce toxicity are needed to determine the future role of sorafenib in treatment of this disease.

"Docetaxel Versus Surveillance After Radical Prostatectomy for High-risk Prostate Cancer: Results from the Prospective Randomised, Open-label Phase 3 Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 12 Trial. Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard treatment for other solid tumours, but to date has not proven effective in prostate cancer. o evaluate whether six cycles of docetaxel alone improve biochemical disease-free survival after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer. Open-label, randomised multinational phase 3 trial. Enrolment of 459 patients after prostatectomy. high-risk pT2 margin positive or pT3a Gleason score ≥4+3, pT3b, or lymph node positive disease Gleason score ≥3+4. Patients assigned (1:1) to either six cycles of adjuvant docetaxel 75mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 wk without daily prednisone (Arm A) or surveillance (Arm B) until endpoint was reached. Primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen progression ≥0.5 ng/ml. Docetaxel treatment after prostatectomy. Median time to progression, death, or last follow-up was 56.8 mo. Primary endpoint was reached in 190/459 patients-the risk of progression at 5 yr being 41% (45% in Arm A and 38% in Arm B). There was evidence of nonproportional hazards in Kaplan-Meier analysis, so we used the difference in restricted mean survival time as the primary estimate of effect. Restricted mean survival time to endpoint was 43 mo in Arm A versus 46 mo in Arm B (p=0.06), a nonsignificant difference of 3.2 mo (95% confidence interval: 6.7 to -1.5 mo). A total of 116 serious adverse events were recorded in Arm A and 41 in Arm B with no treatment-related deaths. Not all patients received docetaxel by protocol. The endpoint is biochemical progression and some patients received radiation treatment before the endpoint. Docetaxel without hormonal therapy did not significantly improve biochemical disease-free survival after radical prostatectomy.

"Cyclophosphamide-Free Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Ovarian Protection in Young Women With Breast Cancer: A Randomized Phase 3 Trial. Chemotherapy-induced premature menopause leads to some consequences, including infertility. We initiated this randomized phase III trial to determine whether a cyclophosphamide-free adjuvant chemotherapy regimen would increase the likelihood of menses resumption and improve survival outcomes. Young women with operable estrogen receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer after definitive surgery were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamidefollowed by weekly paclitaxel (EC-wP) or epirubicin and paclitaxel followed by weekly paclitaxel (EP-wP). All patients received at least 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy after chemotherapy. Two coprimary endpoints were the rate of menstrual resumption at 12 months after chemotherapy and 5-year disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01026116). All statistical tests were 2-sided.

In this S-1 Plus cisplatin versus S-1 In RCT In the Treatment for Stomach cancer (SPIRITS) trial, we aimed to verify that overall survival was better in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with S-1 plus cisplatin than with S-1 alone. In this phase III trial, chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced gastric cancer were enrolled between March 26, 2002, and Nov 30, 2004, at 38 centres in Japan, and randomly assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin or S-1 alone. In patients assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin, S-1 (40-60 mg depending on patient's body surface area) was given orally, twice daily for 3 consecutive weeks, and 60 mg/m(2) cisplatin was given intravenously on day 8, followed by a 2-week rest period, within a 5-week cycle. Those assigned to S-1 alone received the same dose of S-1 twice daily for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, within a 6-week cycle. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, proportions of responders, and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00150670. 305 patients were enrolled; seven patients were ineligible or withdrew consent, therefore, 148 patients were assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin and 150 patients were assigned to S-1 alone. Median overall survival was significantly longer in patients assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin (13.0 months [IQR 7.6-21.9]) than in those assigned to S-1 alone (11.0 months [5.6-19.8]; hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.98; p=0.04). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin than in those assigned to S-1 alone (median progression-free survival 6.0 months [3.3-12.9] vs 4.0 months [2.1-6.8]; p<0.0001). Additionally, of 87 patients assigned S-1 plus cisplatin who had target tumours, one patient had a complete response and 46 patients had partial responses, ie, a total of 54% (range 43-65). Of 106 patients assigned S-1 alone who had target tumours, one patient had a complete response and 32 had partial responses, ie, a total of 31% (23-41). We recorded more grade 3 or 4 adverse events including leucopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, nausea, and anorexia, in the group assigned to S-1 plus cisplatin than in the group assigned to S-1 alone. There were no treatment-related deaths in either group.

"The addition of androgen deprivation therapy and pelvic lymph node treatment to prostate bed salvage radiotherapy (NRG Oncology/RTOG 0534 SPPORT): an international, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial. In men with a detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after prostatectomy for prostate cancer, salvage prostate bed radiotherapy (PBRT) results in about 70% of patients being free of progression at 5 years. A three-group randomised trial was designed to determine whether incremental gains in patient outcomes can be achieved by adding either 4-6 months of short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to PBRT, or both short-term ADT and pelvic lymph node radiotherapy (PLNRT) to PBRT. The international, multicentre, randomised, controlled SPPORT trial was done at 283 radiation oncology cancer treatment centres in the USA, Canada, and Israel. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) were those who after prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate had a persistently detectable or an initially undetectable and rising PSA of between 0·1 and 2·0 ng/mL. Patients with and without lymphadenectomy (N0/Nx) were eligible if there was no clinical or pathological evidence of lymph node involvement. Other eligibility criteria included pT2 or pT3 disease, prostatectomy Gleason score of 9 or less, and a Zubrod performance status of 0-1. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive PBRT alone at a dose of 64·8-70·2 Gy at 1·8 Gy per fraction daily (group 1), PBRT plus short-term ADT (group 2), or PLNRT (45 Gy at 1·8 Gy per fraction, and then a volume reduction made to the planning target volume for the remaining 19·8-25 ·2 Gy) plus PBRT plus short-term ADT (group 3). The primary endpoint was freedom from progression, in which progression was defined as biochemical failure according to the Phoenix definition (PSA ≥2 ng/mL over the nadir PSA), clinical failure (local, regional, or distant), or death from any cause. A planned interim analysis of 1191 patents with minimum potential follow-up time of 5 years applied a Haybittle-Peto boundary of p<0·001 (one sided) for comparison of 5-year freedom from progression rates between the treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00567580. The primary objectives of the trial have been completed, although long-term follow-up is continuing. Between March 31, 2008, and March 30, 2015, 1792 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (592 to group 1 [PBRT alone], 602 to group 2 [PBRT plus short-term ADT], and 598 to group 3 [PLNRT plus PBRT plus short-term ADT]). 76 patients subsequently found to be ineligible were excluded from the analyses; thus, the evaluable patient population comprised 1716 patients. At the interim analysis (n=1191 patients; data cutoff May 23, 2018), the Haybittle-Peto boundary for 5-year freedom from progression was exceeded when group 1 was compared with group 3 (difference 17·9%, SE 2·9%; p<0·0001). The difference between groups 2 and 3 did not exceed the boundary (p=0·0063). With additional follow-up beyond the interim analysis (the final planned analysis; data cutoff May 26, 2021), at a median follow-up among survivors of 8·2 years (IQR 6·6-9·4), the 5-year freedom from progression rates in all 1716 eligible patients were 70·9% (95% CI 67·0-74·9) in group 1, 81·3% (78·0-84·6) in group 2, and 87·4% (84·7-90·2) in group 3. Per protocol criteria, freedom from progression in group 3 was superior to groups 1 and 2. Acute (≤3 months after radiotherapy) grade 2 or worse adverse events were significantly more common in group 3 (246 [44%] of 563 patients) than in group 2 (201 [36%] of 563; p=0·0034), which, in turn, were more common than in group 1 (98 [18%] of 547; p<0·0001). Similar findings were observed for grade 3 or worse adverse events. However, late toxicity (>3 months after radiotherapy) did not differ significantly between the groups, apart from more late grade 2 or worse blood or bone marrow events in group 3 versus group 2 (one-sided p=0·0060) attributable to the addition of PLNRT in this group. The results of this randomised trial establish the benefit of adding short-term ADT to PBRT to prevent progression in prostate cancer. To our knowledge, these are the first such findings to show that extending salvage radiotherapy to treat the pelvic lymph nodes when combined with short-term ADT results in meaningful reductions in progression after prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.

"Cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy versus systemic chemotherapy for colorectal peritoneal metastases: A randomised trial. First-line treatment of isolated resectable colorectal peritoneal metastases remains unclear. This study (the Swedish peritoneal study) compares cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (surgery arm) with systemic chemotherapy (chemotherapy arm). Patients deemed resectable preoperatively were randomised to surgery and intraperitoneal 5-fluorouracil 550 mg/m(2)/d for 6 d with repeated courses every month or to systemic oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil regimen every second week. Both treatments continued for 6 months. Primary end-point was overall survival (OS) and secondary end-points were progression-free survival (PFS), and morbidity. The study terminated prematurely when 48 eligible patients (24/arm) were included due to recruitment difficulties. Two-year OS was 54% in the surgery arm and 38% in the chemotherapy arm (p = 0.04). After 5 years, 8 versus 1 patient were alive, respectively (p = 0.02). Median OS was 25 months versus 18 months, respectively, hazard ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.96, p = 0.04). PFS in the surgery arm was 12 months versus 11 months in the chemotherapy arm (p = 0.16) with 17% versus 0% 5-year PFS. Grade III-IV morbidity was seen in 42% and 50% of the patients, respectively.

"Neoadjuvant anastrozole versus tamoxifen in patients receiving goserelin for premenopausal breast cancer (STAGE): a double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial. Aromatase inhibitors have shown increased efficacy compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal early breast cancer. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in premenopausal women receiving goserelin for early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study, we enrolled premenopausal women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, operable breast cancer with WHO performance status of 2 or lower. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive goserelin 3·6 mg/month plus either anastrozole 1 mg per day and tamoxifen placebo or tamoxifen 20 mg per day and anastrozole placebo for 24 weeks before surgery. Patients were randomised sequentially, stratified by centre, with randomisation codes. All study personnel were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was best overall tumour response (complete response or partial response), assessed by callipers, during the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period for the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was analysed for non-inferiority (with non-inferiority defined as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in overall response rates between groups being 10% or less); in the event of non-inferiority, we assessed the superiority of the anastrozole group versus the tamoxifen group. We included all patients who received study medication at least once in the safety analysis set. We report the primary analysis; treatment will also continue in the adjuvant setting for 5 years. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00605267. Between Oct 2, 2007, and May 29, 2009, 204 patients were enrolled. 197 patients were randomly assigned to anastrozole (n=98) or tamoxifen (n=99), and 185 patients completed the 24-week neoadjuvant treatment period and had breast surgery (95 in the anastrazole group, 90 in the tamoxifen group). More patients in the anastrozole group had a complete or partial response than did those in the tamoxifen group during 24 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment (anastrozole 70·4% [69 of 98 patients] vs tamoxifen 50·5% [50 of 99 patients]; estimated difference between groups 19·9%, 95% CI 6·5-33·3; p=0·004). Two patients in the anastrozole group had treatment-related grade 3 adverse events (arthralgia and syncope) and so did one patient in the tamoxifen group (depression). One serious adverse event was reported in the anastrozole group (benign neoplasm, not related to treatment), compared with none in the tamoxifen group. Given its favourable risk-benefit profile, the combination of anastrozole plus goserelin could represent an alternative neoadjuvant treatment option for premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer.

"Effectiveness of Sequential Chemoradiation vs Concurrent Chemoradiation or Radiation Alone in Adjuvant Treatment After Hysterectomy for Cervical Cancer: The STARS Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial. There is no current consensus on the role of chemotherapy in addition to radiation for postoperative adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage cervical cancer with adverse pathological factors. To evaluate the clinical benefits of sequential chemoradiation (SCRT) and concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) compared with radiation alone (RT) as a postoperative adjuvant treatment in early-stage cervical cancer. After radical hysterectomy at 1 of 8 participating hospitals in China, patients with FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage IB to IIA cervical cancer with adverse pathological factors were randomized 1:1:1 to receive adjuvant RT, CCRT, or SCRT. Data were collected from February 2008 to December 2018. Patients received adjuvant RT (total dose, 45-50 Gy), CCRT (weekly cisplatin, 30-40 mg/m2), or SCRT (cisplatin, 60-75 mg/m2, plus paclitaxel, 135-175 mg/m2) in a 21-day cycle, given 2 cycles before and 2 cycles after radiotherapy, respectively. The primary end point was the rate of disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years. A total of 1048 women (median [range] age, 48 [23-65] years) were included in the analysis (350 in the RT group, 345 in the CCRT group, and 353 in the SCRT group). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced among the treatment groups except that the rate of lymph node involvement was lowest in the RT group (18.3%). In the intention-to-treat population, SCRT was associated with a higher rate of DFS than RT (3-year rate, 90.0% vs 82.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35-0.76) and CCRT (90.0% vs 85.0%; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96). Treatment with SCRT also decreased cancer death risk compared with RT (5-year rate, 92.0% vs 88.0%; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.95) after adjustment for lymph node involvement. However, neither DFS nor cancer death risk was different among patients treated with CCRT or RT. In this randomized clinical trial, conducted in a postoperative adjuvant treatment setting, SCRT, rather than CCRT, resulted in a higher DFS and lower risk of cancer death than RT among women with early-stage cervical cancer.

"Addition of docetaxel to S-1 without platinum prolongs survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer: a randomized study (START). Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil has been globally accepted as a standard regimen for the treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, cisplatin has several disadvantages, including renal toxicity and the need for admission. S-1 plus cisplatin has become a standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer in East Asia. This phase III study was designed to evaluate the potential benefits of adding docetaxel to S-1 without a platinum compound in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel plus S-1 or S-1 alone. The docetaxel plus S-1 group received docetaxel on day 1 and oral S-1 on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle. The S-1 alone group received oral S-1 on days 1-28 of a 42-day cycle. The primary end point was overall survival. Of the 639 patients enrolled, 635 were eligible for analysis. The median overall survival was 12.5 months in the docetaxel plus S-1 group and 10.8 months in the S-1 alone group (p = 0.032). The median progression-free survival was 5.3 months in the docetaxel plus S-1 group and 4.2 months in the S-1 alone group (p = 0.001).

"Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of MB02 (Bevacizumab Biosimilar) versus Reference Bevacizumab in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study (STELLA). MB02 (bevacizumab biosimilar) showed similar structural, functional, and pharmacokinetic properties to reference bevacizumab (Avastin<sup>®</sup>; EU-bevacizumab). To confirm clinical similarity between MB02 and EU-bevacizumab, a comparability study was undertaken in the first-line treatment of stage IIIB/IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This multinational, double-blind, randomized, phase III study (STELLA) compared MB02 or EU-bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) administered with chemotherapy (paclitaxel 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and carboplatin AUC6) on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle for 6 cycles (Week 18), followed by MB02/EU-bevacizumab in blinded monotherapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent or end of study (Week 52). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by an independent radiological review committee (IRC) at Week 18 (intent-to-treat population). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety and immunogenicity. A total of 627 subjects were randomized 1:1 to MB02 (n = 315) or EU-bevacizumab (n = 312). ORR, assessed by the IRC at Week 18, was comparable in MB02 (40.3%) and EU-bevacizumab (44.6%) groups. ORR risk ratio of 0.910 (90% CI 0.780 to 1.060; 95% CI 0.758 to 1.092) and ORR risk difference of -4.02 (90% CI -10.51 to 2.47; 95% CI -11.76 to 3.71) were within the similarity predefined margins. There were no significant differences between MB02 and EU-bevacizumab groups in median PFS (36.0 vs 37.3 weeks, respectively; HR 1.187; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.44) and median OS (not achieved; HR 1.108; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.49) at the end of study. The safety profile of MB02 and EU-bevacizumab regarding nature, frequency and severity of the adverse events (AE) was comparable. The most frequent grade ≥3 investigational-product-related AEs were hypertension and anemia, with a difference between treatment groups of <5%. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing ADA (NAb) incidence were similar in both treatment groups. MB02 demonstrated similar efficacy to EU-bevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, in subjects with advanced non-squamous NSCLC, with comparable safety and immunogenicity profiles.

"Southwest Oncology Group S0008: a phase III trial of high-dose interferon Alfa-2b versus cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, plus interleukin-2 and interferon in patients with high-risk melanoma--an intergroup study of cancer and leukemia Group B, Children's Oncology Group, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and Southwest Oncology Group. High-dose interferon (IFN) for 1 year (HDI) is the US Food and Drug Administration-approved adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk melanoma. Efforts to modify IFN dose and schedule have not improved efficacy. We sought to determine whether a shorter course of biochemotherapy would be more effective. S0008 (S0008: Chemotherapy Plus Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Melanoma) was an Intergroup phase III trial that enrolled high-risk patients (stage IIIA-N2a through IIIC-N3), randomly assigning them to receive either HDI or biochemotherapy consisting of dacarbazine, cisplatin, vinblastine, interleukin-2, IFN alfa-2b (IFN-α-2b) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor given every 21 days for three cycles. Coprimary end points were relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). In all, 432 patients were enrolled. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 57% and 7% of HDI patients and 36% and 40% of biochemotherapy patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 7.2 years, biochemotherapy improved RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.97; P = .015), with a median RFS of 4.0 years (95% CI, 1.9 years to not reached [NR]) versus 1.9 years for HDI (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8 years) and a 5-year RFS of 48% versus 39%. Median OS was not different (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.31; P = .55), with a median OS of 9.9 years (95% CI, 4.62 years to NR) for biochemotherapy versus 6.7 years (95% CI, 4.5 years to NR) for HDI and a 5-year OS of 56% for both arms.

"Phase III trial of maintenance gefitinib or placebo after concurrent chemoradiotherapy and docetaxel consolidation in inoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: SWOG S0023. Early clinical studies with gefitinib showed promising efficacy and mild toxicity in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thus, gefitinib was an ideal agent to evaluate in a maintenance setting in stage III disease. Untreated patients with stage III NSCLC, a performance score of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were eligible. All patients received cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 plus etoposide 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5, every 28 days for two cycles with concurrent thoracic radiation (1.8- to 2-Gy fractions per day; total dose, 61 Gy) followed by three cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m(2). Patients whose disease did not progress were randomly assigned to gefitinib 250 mg/d or placebo until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or the end of 5 years. The planned sample size was 672 patients to confer power of 0.89 to detect a 33% increase over the expected median survival time of 21 months (one-sided P = .025, log-rank test). Random assignment was stratified by stage, histology, and measurable versus nonmeasurable disease. Enrollment began in July 2001. An unplanned interim analysis conducted in April 2005 rejected the alternative hypothesis of improved survival at the P = .0015 level for 243 randomly assigned patients. The study closed, and preliminary results were reported. Now, with a median follow-up time of 27 months, median survival time was 23 months for gefitinib (n = 118) and 35 months for placebo (n = 125; two-sided P = .013). The toxic death rate was 2% with gefitinib compared with 0% for placebo. In this unselected population, gefitinib did not improve survival. Decreased survival was a result of tumor progression and not gefitinib toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18378568/,18378568,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Gefitinib monotherapy when used to treat Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gefitinib monotherapy in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Placebo and Gefitinib monotherapy for managing Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gefitinib monotherapy in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Placebo when compared with Gefitinib monotherapy for Non-small cell lung cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Placebo in comparison to Gefitinib monotherapy for the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Gefitinib monotherapy for addressing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Placebo and Gefitinib monotherapy in the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Gefitinib monotherapy for managing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Placebo compared to Gefitinib monotherapy in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Placebo contrasted with Gefitinib monotherapy in relation to Non-small cell lung cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gefitinib monotherapy for treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Placebo and Gefitinib monotherapy in treating Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Placebo as opposed to Gefitinib monotherapy in managing Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Gefitinib monotherapy in the context of Non-small cell lung cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Placebo compares to Gefitinib monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Non-small cell lung cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Placebo in relation to Gefitinib monotherapy for the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gefitinib monotherapy for managing Non-small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Placebo's efficacy in comparison with Gefitinib monotherapy in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Gefitinib monotherapy regarding Non-small cell lung cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00020709,"{""18378568"": ""Karen Kelly|Kari Chansky|Laurie E Gaspar|Kathy S Albain|James Jett|Yee C Ung|Derick H M Lau|John J Crowley|David R Gandara""}",2001-06,Yes,No,Oral,Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors|Platinum-based Chemotherapy|Taxanes
"Effect of Intravesical Instillation of Gemcitabine vs Saline Immediately Following Resection of Suspected Low-Grade Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer on Tumor Recurrence: SWOG S0337 Randomized Clinical Trial. Low-grade non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer frequently recurs after excision by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). To determine whether immediate post-TURBT intravesical instillation of gemcitabine reduces recurrence of suspected low-grade non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer compared with saline. Randomized double-blind clinical trial conducted at 23 US centers. Patients with suspected low-grade non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer based on cystoscopic appearance without any high-grade or without more than 2 low-grade urothelial cancer episodes within 18 months before index TURBT were enrolled between January 23, 2008, and August 14, 2012, and followed up every 3 months with cystoscopy and cytology for 2 years and then semiannually for 2 years. Patients were monitored for tumor recurrence, progression to muscle invasion, survival, and toxic effects. The final date of follow-up was August 14, 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to receive intravesical instillation of gemcitabine (2 g in 100 mL of saline) (n = 201) or saline (100 mL) (n = 205) for 1 hour immediately following TURBT. The primary outcome was time to recurrence of cancer. Secondary end points were time to muscle invasion and death due to any cause. Among 406 randomized eligible patients (median age, 66 years; 84.7% men), 383 completed the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 67 of 201 patients (4-year estimate, 35%) in the gemcitabine group and 91 of 205 patients (4-year estimate, 47%) in the saline group had cancer recurrence within 4.0 years (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.90; P<.001 by 1-sided log-rank test for time to recurrence). Among the 215 patients with low-grade non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer who underwent TURBT and drug instillation, 34 of 102 patients (4-year estimate, 34%) in the gemcitabine group and 59 of 113 patients (4-year estimate, 54%) in the saline group had cancer recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35-0.81; P = .001 by 1-sided log-rank test for time to recurrence). Fifteen patients had tumors that progressed to muscle invasion (5 in the gemcitabine group and 10 in the saline group; P = .22 by 1-sided log-rank test) and 42 died of any cause (17 in the gemcitabine group and 25 in the saline group; P = .12 by 1-sided log-rank test). There were no grade 4 or 5 adverse events and no significant differences in adverse events of grade 3 or lower. Among patients with suspected low-grade non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer, immediate postresection intravesical instillation of gemcitabine, compared with instillation of saline, significantly reduced the risk of recurrence over a median of 4.0 years. These findings support using this therapy, but further research is needed to compare gemcitabine with other intravesical agents. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00445601.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29801011/,29801011,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Gemcitabine monotherapy when used to treat Bladder cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gemcitabine monotherapy in treating Bladder cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Placebo and Gemcitabine monotherapy for managing Bladder cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gemcitabine monotherapy in treating Bladder cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Placebo when compared with Gemcitabine monotherapy for Bladder cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Placebo in comparison to Gemcitabine monotherapy for the treatment of Bladder cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Gemcitabine monotherapy for addressing Bladder cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Placebo and Gemcitabine monotherapy in the treatment of Bladder cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Gemcitabine monotherapy for managing Bladder cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Placebo compared to Gemcitabine monotherapy in treating Bladder cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Placebo contrasted with Gemcitabine monotherapy in relation to Bladder cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gemcitabine monotherapy for treating Bladder cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Placebo and Gemcitabine monotherapy in treating Bladder cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Placebo as opposed to Gemcitabine monotherapy in managing Bladder cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Placebo compared to Gemcitabine monotherapy in the context of Bladder cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Placebo compares to Gemcitabine monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Bladder cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Placebo in relation to Gemcitabine monotherapy for the treatment of Bladder cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Placebo versus Gemcitabine monotherapy for managing Bladder cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Placebo's efficacy in comparison with Gemcitabine monotherapy in treating Bladder cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Placebo against Gemcitabine monotherapy regarding Bladder cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00445601,"{""29801011"": ""Edward M Messing|Catherine M Tangen|Seth P Lerner|Deepak M Sahasrabudhe|Theresa M Koppie|David P Wood|Philip C Mack|Robert S Svatek|Christopher P Evans|Khaled S Hafez|Daniel J Culkin|Timothy C Brand|Lawrence I Karsh|Jeffrey M Holzbeierlein|Shandra S Wilson|Guan Wu|Melissa Plets|Nicholas J Vogelzang|Ian M Thompson""}",2007-09,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Antimetabolites
"Phase III randomized intergroup trial of subtotal lymphoid irradiation versus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and subtotal lymphoid irradiation for stage IA to IIA Hodgkin's disease. The management of early-stage Hodgkin's disease in the United States is controversial. To evaluate whether staging laparotomy could be safely avoided in early-stage Hodgkin's disease and whether chemotherapy should be a part of the treatment of nonlaparotomy staged patients, a phase III intergroup trial was performed. Three hundred forty-eight patients with clinical stage IA to IIA supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin's disease were randomized without staging laparotomy to treatment with either subtotal lymphoid irradiation (STLI) or combined-modality therapy (CMT) consisting of three cycles of doxorubicin and vinblastine followed by STLI. The study was closed at the second, planned, interim analysis because of a markedly superior failure-free survival (FFS) rate for patients on the CMT arm (94%) compared with the STLI arm (81%). With a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 10 patients have experienced relapse or died on the chemoradiotherapy arm, compared with 34 on the radiotherapy arm (P <.001). Few deaths have occurred on either arm (three deaths on CMT and seven deaths on STLI). Treatment was well tolerated, with only one death on each arm attributed to treatment. These results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a high FFS rate in a large group of stage IA to IIA patients without performing staging laparotomy and that three cycles of chemotherapy plus STLI provide a superior FFS compared with STLI alone.

"Docetaxel and estramustine compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone for advanced refractory prostate cancer. Mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy palliates pain without extending survival in men with progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer. We compared docetaxel plus estramustine with mitoxantrone plus prednisone in men with metastatic, hormone-independent prostate cancer. We randomly assigned 770 men to one of two treatments, each given in 21-day cycles: 280 mg of estramustine three times daily on days 1 through 5, 60 mg of docetaxel per square meter of body-surface area on day 2, and 60 mg of dexamethasone in three divided doses before docetaxel, or 12 mg of mitoxantrone per square meter on day 1 plus 5 mg of prednisone twice daily. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were progression-free survival, objective response rates, and post-treatment declines of at least 50 percent in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Of 674 eligible patients, 338 were assigned to receive docetaxel and estramustine and 336 to receive mitoxantrone and prednisone. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the median overall survival was longer in the group given docetaxel and estramustine than in the group given mitoxantrone and prednisone (17.5 months vs. 15.6 months, P=0.02 by the log-rank test), and the corresponding hazard ratio for death was 0.80 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.97). The median time to progression was 6.3 months in the group given docetaxel and estramustine and 3.2 months in the group given mitoxantrone and prednisone (P<0.001 by the log-rank test). PSA declines of at least 50 percent occurred in 50 percent and 27 percent of patients, respectively (P<0.001), and objective tumor responses were observed in 17 percent and 11 percent of patients with bidimensionally measurable disease, respectively (P=0.30). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenic fevers (P=0.01), nausea and vomiting (P<0.001), and cardiovascular events (P=0.001) were more common among patients receiving docetaxel and estramustine than among those receiving mitoxantrone and prednisone. Pain relief was similar in both groups. The improvement in median survival of nearly two months with docetaxel and estramustine, as compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone, provides support for this approach in men with metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15470214/,15470214,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine compared to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone when used to treat Prostate cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine versus Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine and Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine versus Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine when compared with Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for Prostate cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine in comparison to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine compared to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for addressing Prostate cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine and Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in the treatment of Prostate cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine against Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for managing Prostate cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine compared to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in treating Prostate cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine contrasted with Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in relation to Prostate cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine versus Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for treating Prostate cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine and Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in treating Prostate cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine as opposed to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in managing Prostate cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine compared to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in the context of Prostate cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Docetaxel and Estramustine compares to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in terms of effectiveness for Prostate cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine in relation to Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Estramustine versus Mitoxantrone and Prednisone for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Docetaxel and Estramustine's efficacy in comparison with Mitoxantrone and Prednisone in treating Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel and Estramustine against Mitoxantrone and Prednisone regarding Prostate cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00004001,"{""15470214"": ""Daniel P Petrylak|Catherine M Tangen|Maha H A Hussain|Primo N Lara|Jeffrey A Jones|Mary Ellen Taplin|Patrick A Burch|Donna Berry|Carol Moinpour|Manish Kohli|Mitchell C Benson|Eric J Small|Derek Raghavan|E David Crawford""}",1999-10,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Corticosteroids|Taxanes
"Effect of Capecitabine Maintenance Therapy Plus Best Supportive Care vs Best Supportive Care Alone on Progression-Free Survival Among Patients With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Who Had Received Induction Chemotherapy: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial. Capecitabine maintenance therapy improves survival outcomes in various cancer types, but data are limited on the efficacy and safety of capecitabine maintenance therapy in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). To investigate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine maintenance therapy in metastatic NPC. This randomized phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from May 16, 2015, to January 9, 2020, among 104 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NPC who had achieved disease control after 4 to 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine. The final follow-up date was May 30, 2021. All efficacy analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat population. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either capecitabine maintenance therapy (1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14) every 3 weeks plus best supportive care (BSC) (capecitabine maintenance group) or BSC alone after 4 to 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points were objective response rate, duration of response, overall survival, and safety. This study included 104 patients (84 men [80.8%]; median age, 47 years [IQR, 38-54 years]), with 52 assigned to the capecitabine maintenance group and 52 assigned to the BSC group. After a median follow-up of 33.8 months (IQR, 22.9-50.7 months), there were 23 events (44.2%) of progression or death in the capecitabine maintenance group and 37 events (71.2%) of progression or death in the BSC group. Median PFS survival was significantly higher in the capecitabine maintenance group (35.9 months [95% CI, 20.5 months-not reached]) than in the BSC group (8.2 months [95% CI, 6.4-10.0 months]), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.74; P = .002). Higher objective response rates and longer median duration of response were observed in the capecitabine maintenance group (25.0%; 40.0 months) compared with the BSC group (objective response rate, 25.0% [n = 13] vs 11.5% [n = 6]; and median duration of response, 40.0 months [95% CI, not reached-not reached] vs 13.2 months [95% CI, 9.9-16.5 months]). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during maintenance therapy were anemia (6 of 50 [12.0%]), hand-foot syndrome (5 of 50 [10.0%]), nausea and vomiting (3 of 50 [6.0%]), fatigue (2 of 50 [4.0%]), and mucositis (2 of 50 [4.0%]). No deaths in the maintenance group were deemed treatment-related. In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, capecitabine maintenance therapy significantly improved PFS for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NPC who achieved disease control after capecitabine-containing induction chemotherapy.

"Effect of Radiotherapy Alone vs Radiotherapy With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy on Survival Without Disease Relapse in Patients With Low-risk Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the standard treatment for stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) based on data using 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy. There is limited evidence for the role of chemotherapy with use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). To assess whether concurrent chemotherapy can be safely omitted for patients with low-risk stage II/T3N0 NPC treated with IMRT. This multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3, noninferiority clinical trial was conducted at 5 Chinese hospitals, including 341 adult patients with low-risk NPC, defined as stage II/T3N0M0 without adverse features (all nodes <3 cm, no level IV/Vb nodes; no extranodal extension; Epstein-Barr virus DNA <4000 copies/mL), with enrollment between November 2015 and August 2020. The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2022. Patients were randomly assigned to receive IMRT alone (n = 172) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (IMRT with cisplatin, 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles [n = 169]). The primary end point was 3-year failure-free survival (time from randomization to any disease relapse or death), with a noninferiority margin of 10%. Secondary end points comprised overall survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, adverse events, and health-related quality of life (QOL) measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30; range, 0-100 points; minimum clinically important difference ≥10 for physical function, symptom control, or health-related QOL; higher score indicates better functioning and global health status or worse symptoms). Among 341 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 48 [10] years; 30% women), 334 (98.0%) completed the trial. Median follow-up was 46 months (IQR, 34-58). Three-year failure-free survival was 90.5% for the IMRT-alone group vs 91.9% for the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group (difference, -1.4%; 1-sided 95% CI, -7.4% to ∞; P value for noninferiority, <.001). No significant differences were observed between groups in overall survival, locoregional relapse, or distant metastasis. The IMRT-alone group experienced a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 to 4 adverse events (17% vs 46%; difference, -29% [95% CI, -39% to -20%]), including hematologic toxicities (leukopenia, neutropenia) and nonhematologic toxicities (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, mucositis). The IMRT-alone group had significantly better QOL scores during radiotherapy including the domains of global health status, social functioning, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipation. Among patients with low-risk NPC, treatment with IMRT alone resulted in 3-year failure-free survival that was not inferior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

"Effect of Capecitabine Maintenance Therapy Using Lower Dosage and Higher Frequency vs Observation on Disease-Free Survival Among Patients With Early-Stage Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Who Had Received Standard Treatment: The SYSUCC-001 Randomized Clinical Trial. Among all subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer has a relatively high relapse rate and poor outcome after standard treatment. Effective strategies to reduce the risk of relapse and death are needed. To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of low-dose capecitabine maintenance after standard adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. Randomized clinical trial conducted at 13 academic centers and clinical sites in China from April 2010 to December 2016 and final date of follow-up was April 30, 2020. Patients (n = 443) had early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and had completed standard adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive capecitabine (n = 222) at a dose of 650 mg/m2 twice a day by mouth for 1 year without interruption or to observation (n = 221) after completion of standard adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, and adverse events. Among 443 women who were randomized, 434 were included in the full analysis set (mean [SD] age, 46 [9.9] years; T1/T2 stage, 93.1%; node-negative, 61.8%) (98.0% completed the trial). After a median follow-up of 61 months (interquartile range, 44-82), 94 events were observed, including 38 events (37 recurrences and 32 deaths) in the capecitabine group and 56 events (56 recurrences and 40 deaths) in the observation group. The estimated 5-year disease-free survival was 82.8% in the capecitabine group and 73.0% in the observation group (hazard ratio [HR] for risk of recurrence or death, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.42-0.95]; P = .03). In the capecitabine group vs the observation group, the estimated 5-year distant disease-free survival was 85.8% vs 75.8% (HR for risk of distant metastasis or death, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.38-0.92]; P = .02), the estimated 5-year overall survival was 85.5% vs 81.3% (HR for risk of death, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.47-1.19]; P = .22), and the estimated 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival was 85.0% vs 80.8% (HR for risk of locoregional recurrence or death, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.46-1.13]; P = .15). The most common capecitabine-related adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (45.2%), with 7.7% of patients experiencing a grade 3 event. Among women with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer who received standard adjuvant treatment, low-dose capecitabine maintenance therapy for 1 year, compared with observation, resulted in significantly improved 5-year disease-free survival.

"Trastuzumab Plus Endocrine Therapy or Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment for Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive and HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (SYSUCC-002). There is no research evidence demonstrate which is the better partner strategy, endocrine therapy or chemotherapy, to combine with anti-HER2 therapy as the first-line management of hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR+) and HER2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We wished to ascertain if trastuzumab plus endocrine therapy is noninferior to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. We conducted an open-label, noninferiority, phase III, randomized, controlled trial (NCT01950182) at nine hospitals in China. Participants, stratified by previous adjuvant endocrine therapy and disease status (recurrent disease vs. de novo metastasis), were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive trastuzumab plus endocrine therapy (per investigator's choice of oestrogen-receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitor, with/without concurrent ovarian suppression) or chemotherapy (per investigator's choice of taxanes, capecitabine, or vinorelbine).

"Adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with solitary tumor and microvascular invasion: a randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety. The optimal strategy for adjuvant therapy after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with solitary tumor and microvascular invasion (MVI) is controversial. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after hepatectomy versus hepatectomy alone in HCC patients with a solitary tumor ≥ 5 cm and MVI. In this randomized, open-labeled, phase III trial, HCC patients with a solitary tumor ≥ 5 cm and MVI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 1-2 cycles of adjuvant TACE after hepatectomy (Hepatectomy-TACE) or hepatectomy alone (Hepatectomy Alone). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and adverse events. Between June 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012, 250 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the Hepatectomy-TACE group (n = 125) or the Hepatectomy Alone group (n = 125). Clinicopathological characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The median follow-up time from randomization was 37.5 months [interquartile range 18.3-48.2 months]. The median DFS was significantly longer in the Hepatectomy-TACE group than in the Hepatectomy Alone group [17.45 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.99-29.14) vs. 9.27 months (95% CI 6.05-13.70), hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70 (95% CI 0.52-0.95), P = 0.020], respectively. The median OS was also significantly longer in the Hepatectomy-TACE group than in the Hepatectomy Alone group [44.29 months (95% CI 25.99-62.58) vs. 22.37 months (95% CI 10.84-33.91), HR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.97), P = 0.029]. Treatment-related adverse events were more frequently observed in the Hepatectomy-TACE group, although these were generally mild and manageable. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in both groups were neutropenia and liver dysfunction.

"Bendamustine plus rituximab versus CHOP plus rituximab as first-line treatment for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas: an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 non-inferiority trial. Rituximab plus chemotherapy, most often CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), is the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced indolent lymphoma, and for elderly patients with mantle-cell lymphoma. Bendamustine plus rituximab is effective for relapsed or refractory disease. We compared bendamustine plus rituximab with CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP) as first-line treatment for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas. We did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial at 81 centres in Germany between Sept 1, 2003, and Aug 31, 2008. Patients aged 18 years or older with a WHO performance status of 2 or less were eligible if they had newly diagnosed stage III or IV indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma. Patients were stratified by histological lymphoma subtype, then randomly assigned according to a prespecified randomisation list to receive either intravenous bendamustine (90 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle) or CHOP (cycles every 3 weeks of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg/day for 5 days) for a maximum of six cycles. Patients in both groups received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle. Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. Analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00991211, and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices of Germany, BfArM 4021335. 274 patients were assigned to bendamustine plus rituximab (261 assessed) and 275 to R-CHOP (253 assessed). At median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 25-57), median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the bendamustine plus rituximab group than in the R-CHOP group (69.5 months [26.1 to not yet reached] vs 31.2 months [15.2-65.7]; hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.74; p<0.0001). Bendamustine plus rituximab was better tolerated than R-CHOP, with lower rates of alopecia (0 patients vs 245 (100%) of 245 patients who recieved ≥3 cycles; p<0.0001), haematological toxicity (77 [30%] vs 173 [68%]; p<0.0001), infections (96 [37%] vs 127 [50%]); p=0.0025), peripheral neuropathy (18 [7%] vs 73 [29%]; p<0.0001), and stomatitis (16 [6%] vs 47 [19%]; p<0.0001). Erythematous skin reactions were more common in patients in the bendamustine plus rituximab group than in those in the R-CHOP group (42 [16%] vs 23 [9%]; p=0.024). In patients with previously untreated indolent lymphoma, bendamustine plus rituximab can be considered as a preferred first-line treatment approach to R-CHOP because of increased progression-free survival and fewer toxic effects.

"Bevacizumab + capecitabine as maintenance therapy after initial bevacizumab + XELOX treatment in previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: phase III 'Stop and Go' study results--a Turkish Oncology Group Trial. It was the aim of this study to evaluate maintenance therapy with bevacizumab + capecitabine following induction with bevacizumab + capecitabine + oxaliplatin (XELOX) versus bevacizumab + XELOX until progression as first-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients received either bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) + XELOX (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 + oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks) until disease progression (arm A) or the same doses of bevacizumab + XELOX for 6 cycles followed by bevacizumab + capecitabine until disease progression (arm B). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety. One hundred and twenty-three patients were randomized. Treatment compliance was similar in both groups. Median PFS was significantly longer for arm B than for arm A (11.0 vs. 8.3 months; p = 0.002). There was no significant difference between the two arms for ORR (66.7 vs. 59.0%; p = 0.861) or median OS (23.8 vs. 20.2 months; p = 0.100). Tolerability was acceptable in both treatment arms; the most frequent grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (arm B vs. arm A) were fatigue (6.6 vs. 16.1%), diarrhoea (3.3 vs. 11.3%), anorexia (3.3 vs. 11.3%), and neuropathy (1.6 vs. 8.1%).

"A randomized phase III trial comparing trabectedin to best supportive care in patients with pre-treated soft tissue sarcoma: T-SAR, a French Sarcoma Group trial. The French Sarcoma Group assessed the efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QoL) of trabectedin versus best supportive care (BSC) in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS). This randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase III study included adults with STS who progressed after 1-3 prior treatment lines. Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive trabectedin 1.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks or BSC, stratified into L-STS (liposarcoma/leiomyosarcoma) and non-L-STS groups (other histotypes). Patients from the BSC arm were allowed to cross over to trabectedin at progression. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) confirmed by blinded central review and analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. Between 26 January 2015 and 5 November 2015, 103 heavily pre-treated patients (60.2% with L-STS) from 16 French centers were allocated to receive trabectedin (n = 52) or BSC (n = 51). Median PFS was 3.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-5.9 months] in the trabectedin arm versus 1.5 months (0.9-2.6 months) in the BSC arm (hazard ratio = 0.39, 95% CI 0.24-0.64, P < 0.001) with benefits observed across almost all analyzed subgroups, but particularly in patients with L-STS (5.1 versus 1.4 months, P = 0.0001). Seven patients (13.7%) in the trabectedin arm (all with L-STS) achieved a partial response, while no objective responses were observed in the BSC arm (P = 0.004). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (44.2% of patients), leukopenia (34.6%), and transaminase increase (32.7%). Health-related 30-item core European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire evidenced no statistical differences between the arms for any domain and at any time point.

Of the 9719 eligible patients with follow-up information, 6711 (69%) had a midrange recurrence score of 11 to 25 and were randomly assigned to receive either chemoendocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone. The trial was designed to show noninferiority of endocrine therapy alone for invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom from invasive disease recurrence, second primary cancer, or death). Endocrine therapy was noninferior to chemoendocrine therapy in the analysis of invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio for invasive disease recurrence, second primary cancer, or death [endocrine vs. chemoendocrine therapy], 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.24; P=0.26). At 9 years, the two treatment groups had similar rates of invasive disease-free survival (83.3% in the endocrine-therapy group and 84.3% in the chemoendocrine-therapy group), freedom from disease recurrence at a distant site (94.5% and 95.0%) or at a distant or local-regional site (92.2% and 92.9%), and overall survival (93.9% and 93.8%). The chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free survival varied with the combination of recurrence score and age (P=0.004), with some benefit of chemotherapy found in women 50 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of 16 to 25. Adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similar efficacy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene recurrence score, although some benefit of chemotherapy was found in some women 50 years of age or younger.

"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study. Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials. This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57). Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance. Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months. No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned. The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81). Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81). The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%). This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22565002/,22565002,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen compared to Tamoxifen monotherapy when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen versus Tamoxifen monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen and Tamoxifen monotherapy for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen versus Tamoxifen monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen when compared with Tamoxifen monotherapy for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen in comparison to Tamoxifen monotherapy for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen compared to Tamoxifen monotherapy for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen and Tamoxifen monotherapy in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen against Tamoxifen monotherapy for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen compared to Tamoxifen monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen contrasted with Tamoxifen monotherapy in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen versus Tamoxifen monotherapy for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen and Tamoxifen monotherapy in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen as opposed to Tamoxifen monotherapy in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen compared to Tamoxifen monotherapy in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Everolimus and Tamoxifen compares to Tamoxifen monotherapy in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen in relation to Tamoxifen monotherapy for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Everolimus and Tamoxifen versus Tamoxifen monotherapy for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Everolimus and Tamoxifen's efficacy in comparison with Tamoxifen monotherapy in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Everolimus and Tamoxifen against Tamoxifen monotherapy regarding Breast cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01298713,"{""22565002"": ""Thomas Bachelot|Céline Bourgier|Claire Cropet|Isabelle Ray-Coquard|Jean-Marc Ferrero|Gilles Freyer|Sophie Abadie-Lacourtoisie|Jean-Christophe Eymard|Marc Debled|Dominique Spaëth|Eric Legouffe|Djelila Allouache|Claude El Kouri|Eric Pujade-Lauraine""}",2008-03,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Mtor Inhibitors
"Nivolumab with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab for first-line treatment of advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. This international, randomized, double-blind phase III study (ONO-4538-52/TASUKI-52) evaluated nivolumab with bevacizumab and cytotoxic chemotherapy as first-line treatment for nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Between June 2017 and July 2019, this study enrolled treatment-naïve patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 alterations. They were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive nivolumab or placebo in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by nivolumab/placebo with bevacizumab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent radiology review committee (IRRC). Overall, 550 patients from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were randomized; of these patients, 273 and 275 received the nivolumab and placebo combinations, respectively. In the present preplanned interim analysis with a median follow up of 13.7 months, the IRRC-assessed median PFS was significantly longer in the nivolumab arm than in the placebo arm (12.1 versus 8.1 months; hazard ratio 0.56; 96.4% confidence interval 0.43-0.71; P < 0.0001). The PFS benefit was observed across all patients with any programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels including PD-L1-negative patients. The IRRC-assessed objective response rates were 61.5% and 50.5% in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was comparable between the two arms; treatment-related adverse events leading to death were observed in five and four patients in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively.

"Randomized phase III study of docetaxel compared with paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer. This randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label, phase III study compared docetaxel versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer that had progressed after an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen. Patients (n = 449) were randomly assigned to receive either docetaxel 100 mg/m2 (n = 225) or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (n = 224) on day 1, every 21 days until tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

"Final results of a randomized phase III trial of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with stage IVA and IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma-Taiwan Cooperative Oncology Group (TCOG) 1303 Study. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is superior to radiotherapy alone for treating locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Whether adding induction chemotherapy (IC) further improves the outcome warrants investigation. This open-label multicenter phase III trial was conducted at 11 institutions in Taiwan. Patients with stage IVA or IVB NPC were randomized to receive IC followed by CCRT (I-CCRT) or CCRT alone. Patients in the I-CCRT arm received three cycles of mitomycin C, epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (MEPFL). All patients received 30 mg/m2 cisplatin weekly during radiotherapy, which was delivered as 1.8-2.2 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week, to a total dose of 70 Gy or greater to the primary tumor and 66-70 Gy to the involved neck. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). In this study, 240 and 239 patients were randomized to CCRT and I-CCRT arm, respectively. The most prominent toxicities of induction were leukopenia (grade 3 and 4: 47% and 12%) and thrombocytopenia (grade 3 and 4: 24% and 3%). During radiotherapy, severe mucositis was the major side-effect in both arms; an increased number of patients in the I-CCRT arm had myelosuppression; hence, discontinuation of weekly cisplatin was more common. After a median follow-up of 72.0 months, the I-CCRT arm had significantly higher DFS than that of the CCRT arm [5-year rate 61% versus 50%; hazard ratio=0.739, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.565-0.965; P = 0.0264], after stratified for N3b and LDH, and adjusted for T stage.

This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial. Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status. Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322. Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576). After a median follow-up of 47·4 months (range 0·4-60·0) in the lapatinib group and 48·3 (0·7-61·3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·83, 95% CI 0·70-1·00; p=0·053). Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive. 157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0·82, 95% 0·67-1·00; p=0·04). Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]). Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population. However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival. Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.

"Results of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Trial of Trifluridine/Tipiracil (TAS-102) Monotherapy in Asian Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: The TERRA Study. Purpose Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) was effective in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in a phase II Japanese trial. This regional trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of trifluridine/tipiracil in Asian patients with mCRC with or without exposure to biologic therapy. Patients and Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial was conducted at 30 sites in China, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand. Patients ≥ 18 years old with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum and known KRAS status who were refractory or intolerant to two or more prior chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; minimization method) to receive trifluridine/tipiracil (twice per day orally; 5 days on and 2 days off for 2 weeks, followed by 14 days off per cycle) or placebo. The primary end point was overall survival (intent-to-treat population). Results Between October 16, 2013, and June 15, 2015, 406 patients were randomly assigned to receive trifluridine/tipiracil (n = 271) or placebo (n = 135). Risk of death was significantly lower in the trifluridine/tipiracil arm than in the placebo arm (hazard ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.99; log-rank P = .035). Median overall survival was significantly longer in the trifluridine/tipiracil than in the placebo arm (7.8 months [95% CI, 7.1 to 8.8 months] v 7.1 months [95% CI, 5.9 to 8.2 months], respectively), for a median survival follow-up time of 13.8 months (95% CI, 13.1 to 15.3 months) compared with 13.4 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 17.3 months), respectively. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the arms (trifluridine/tipiracil, n = 63 [23.2%]; placebo, n = 32 [23.7%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion Trifluridine/tipiracil has a statistically significant survival benefit compared with placebo in Asian patients with mCRC refractory or intolerant to standard chemotherapies, regardless of exposure to biologic therapy.

"Docetaxel maintenance therapy versus best supportive care after first-line chemotherapy with different dose docetaxel plus cisplatin for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (TFINE study, CTONG-0904): an open-label, randomized, phase III trial. Maintenance therapy is important in the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present TFINE study assessed the efficacy and safety of docetaxel continuation maintenance (DCM) therapy after first-line treatment with different doses of docetaxel plus cisplatin. In this open-label, randomized, phase III study, newly diagnosed patients with advanced NSCLC were initially randomized (R1, 1:1) to receive first-line treatment with cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> plus docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (DC75) or 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (DC60) for up to 4 cycles. Patients without progression were further randomized (R2, 1:2) to best supportive care (BSC) or DCM (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for up to 6 cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) after R2, and the secondary endpoints included best response rate in first-line treatment, overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and toxicities. A total of 375 patients were enrolled in R1 and 184 of these patients continued in R2. DCM significantly prolonged PFS compared to BSC (HR =0.57, median PFS =5.8 <i>vs</i>. 3.0 months, P=0.002). The response rates were 30.2% and 23.9% in the DC75 and DC60 groups, respectively (P=0.17). There was no significant difference in OS (12.3 <i>vs</i>. 13.7 months, P=0.77). Additionally, 47.8% and 45.7% of patients reported AEs in the DC75 and DC60 groups, respectively. Diarrhea was more frequent with DC75 than with DC60 (8.6% <i>vs</i>. 3.2%, P=0.029). Other toxicities were comparable between the 2 docetaxel dose groups. Continuation maintenance treatment with docetaxel is well tolerated and improves PFS in patients with NSCLC. The docetaxel dose of 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> may be preferred due to similar efficacy and less diarrhea.

"Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of thalidomide plus dexamethasone compared with dexamethasone as initial therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The long-term impact of thalidomide plus dexamethasone (thal/dex) as primary therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) is unknown. The goal of this study was to compare thalidomide plus dexamethasone versus placebo plus dexamethasone (placebo/dex)as primary therapy for newly diagnosed MM. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with untreated symptomatic MM were randomized to thal/dex (arm A) or to placebo plus dexamethasone (dex) (arm B). Patients in arm A received oral thalidomide 50 mg daily, escalated to 100 mg on day 15, and to 200 mg from day 1 of cycle 2 (28-day cycles). Oral dex 40 mg was administered on days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 during cycles 1 through 4 and on days 1 through 4 only from cycle 5 onwards. Patients in arm B received placebo and dex, administered as in arm A. The primary end point of the study was time to progression. This study is registered at http://ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00057564). A total of 470 patients were enrolled (235 randomly assigned to thal/dex and 235 to placebo/dex). The overall response rate was significantly higher with thal/dex compared with placebo/dex (63% v 46%), P < .001. Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer with thal/dex compared with placebo/dex (median, 22.6 v 6.5 months, P < .001).

"Tivozanib versus sorafenib as initial targeted therapy for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma: results from a phase III trial. Tivozanib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), -2, and -3. This phase III trial compared tivozanib with sorafenib as initial targeted therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients with metastatic RCC, with a clear cell component, prior nephrectomy, measurable disease, and 0 or 1 prior therapies for metastatic RCC were randomly assigned to tivozanib or sorafenib. Prior VEGF-targeted therapy and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor were not permitted. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent review. A total of 517 patients were randomly assigned to tivozanib (n = 260) or sorafenib (n = 257). PFS was longer with tivozanib than with sorafenib in the overall population (median, 11.9 v 9.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.797; 95% CI, 0.639 to 0.993; P = .042). One hundred fifty-six patients (61%) who progressed on sorafenib crossed over to receive tivozanib. The final overall survival (OS) analysis showed a trend toward longer survival on the sorafenib arm than on the tivozanib arm (median, 29.3 v 28.8 months; HR, 1.245; 95% CI, 0.954 to 1.624; P = .105). Adverse events (AEs) more common with tivozanib than with sorafenib were hypertension (44% v 34%) and dysphonia (21% v 5%). AEs more common with sorafenib than with tivozanib were hand-foot skin reaction (54% v 14%) and diarrhea (33% v 23%).

"Addition of thalidomide to oral melphalan/prednisone in patients with multiple myeloma not eligible for transplantation: results of a randomized trial from the Turkish Myeloma Study Group. The combination of melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide (MPT) has been investigated in several clinical studies that differed significantly with regard to patient characteristics and treatment schedules. This prospective trial differs from previous melphalan-prednisone (MP) vs. MPT trials by treatment dosing, duration, routine anticoagulation, and permission for a crossover. Newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (n=122) aged greater than 55 yr, not eligible for transplantation were randomized to receive 8 cycles of M (9 mg/m(2) /d) and P (60 mg/m(2) /d) for 4d every 6 wk (n=62) or MP and thalidomide (100 mg/d) continuously (n=60). Primary endpoint was treatment response and toxicities following 4 and 8 cycles of therapy. Secondary endpoints were disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Overall, MPT-treated patients were younger (median 69 yr vs. 72 yr; P=0.016) and had a higher incidence of renal impairment (RI, 19% vs. 7%, respectively; P=0.057). After 4 cycles of treatment (n=115), there were more partial responses or better in the MPT arm than in the MP arm (57.9% vs. 37.5%; P=0.030). However, DFS and OS were not significantly different between the arms after a median of 23 months follow-up (median OS 26.0 vs. 28.0 months, P=0.655; DFS 21.0 vs. 14.0 months, P=0.342, respectively). Crossover to MPT was required in 11 patients, 57% of whom responded to treatment. A higher rate of grade 3-4 infections was observed in the MPT arm compared with the MP arm (22.4% vs. 7.0%; P=0.033). However, none of these infections were associated with febrile neutropenia. Death within the first 3 months was observed more frequently in the MP arm (n=8, 14.0%) than in the MPT arm (n=2, 3.4%; P=0.053). Long-term discontinuation and dose reduction rates were also analyzed (MPT: 15.5% vs. MP: 5.3%; P=0.072).

The secondary end points included overall survival and safety. Overall, 200 and 100 patients, in the toripalimab and placebo arm respectively had PD-L1-positive TNBC. At the prespecified interim analysis, a statistically significant improvement in PFS assessed by a blinded independent central review was demonstrated in the experimental arm in the PD-L1-positive population (median PFS 8.4 versus 5.6 months; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.470-0.906, P = 0.0102). The median overall survival was 32.8 versus 19.5 months (HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.414-0.914, P = 0.0148). Similar incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (99.2% versus 98.9%), grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs (56.4% versus 54.3%) and fatal AEs (0.6% versus 3.4%) occurred in the experimental and control arms. The addition of toripalimab to nab-P provided a significant improvement in PFS for PD-L1-positive patients with metastatic or recurrent TNBC with an acceptable safety profile.

"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study of ixazomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: China Continuation study. The China Continuation study was a separate regional expansion of the global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III TOURMALINE-MM1 study of ixazomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) following one to three prior therapies. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ixazomib 4.0 mg or placebo on days 1, 8, and 15, plus lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, in 28-day cycles. Randomization was stratified according to number of prior therapies, disease stage, and prior proteasome inhibitor exposure. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). In total, 115 Chinese patients were randomized (57 ixazomib-Rd, 58 placebo-Rd). At the preplanned final analysis for PFS, after median PFS follow-up of 7.4 and 6.9 months, respectively, PFS was improved with ixazomib-Rd versus placebo-Rd (median 6.7 vs 4.0 months; HR 0.598; p = 0.035). At the preplanned final analysis of overall survival (OS), after median follow-up of 20.2 and 19.1 months, respectively, OS was improved with ixazomib-Rd versus placebo-Rd (median 25.8 vs 15.8 months; HR 0.419; p = 0.001). On the ixazomib-Rd and placebo-Rd arms, respectively, 38 (67%) and 43 (74%) patients reported grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), 19 (33%) and 18 (31%) reported serious AEs, and 4 (7%) and 5 (9%) died on-study. The most frequent grade 3/4 AEs were thrombocytopenia (18%/7% vs 14%/5%), neutropenia (19%/5% vs 19%/2%), and anemia (12%/0 vs 26%/2%).

"Oral ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Continuous lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd)-based regimens are among the standards of care in transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. The oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib is suitable for continuous dosing, with predictable, manageable toxicities. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled TOURMALINE-MM2 trial, transplant-ineligible NDMM patients were randomized to ixazomib 4 mg (n = 351) or placebo (n = 354) plus Rd. After 18 cycles, dexamethasone was discontinued and treatment was continued using reduced-dose ixazomib (3 mg) and lenalidomide (10 mg) until progression/toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 35.3 vs 21.8 months with ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.830; 95% confidence interval, 0.676-1.018; P = .073; median follow-up, 53.3 and 55.8 months). Complete (26% vs 14%; odds ratio [OR], 2.10; P < .001) and ≥ very good partial response (63% vs 48%; OR, 1.87; P < .001) rates were higher with ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd. In a prespecified high-risk cytogenetics subgroup, median PFS was 23.8 vs 18.0 months (HR, 0.690; P = .019). Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly grade 1/2. With ixazomib-Rd vs placebo-Rd, 88% vs 81% of patients experienced grade ≥3 TEAEs, 66% vs 62% serious TEAEs, and 35% vs 27% TEAEs resulting in regimen discontinuation; 8% vs 6% died on study. Addition of ixazomib to Rd was tolerable with no new safety signals and led to a clinically meaningful PFS benefit of 13.5 months.

"Effect of eltrombopag on platelet counts and bleeding during treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eltrombopag is an oral, non-peptide, thrombopoietin-receptor agonist that stimulates thrombopoiesis, leading to increased platelet production. This study assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once daily eltrombopag 50 mg, and explored the efficacy of a dose increase to 75 mg. In this phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adults from 63 sites in 23 countries with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), platelet counts less than 30 000 per muL of blood, and one or more previous ITP treatment received standard care plus once-daily eltrombopag 50 mg (n=76) or placebo (n=38) for up to 6 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio of eltrombopag:placebo by a validated randomisation system. After 3 weeks, patients with platelet counts less than 50 000 per microL could increase study drug to 75 mg. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving platelet counts 50 000 per microL or more at day 43. All participants who received at least one dose of their allocated treatment were included in the analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00102739. 73 patients in the eltrombopag group and 37 in the placebo group were included in the efficacy population and were evaluable for day-43 analyses. 43 (59%) eltrombopag patients and six (16%) placebo patients responded (ie, achieved platelet counts >/=50 000 per microL; odds ratio [OR] 9.61 [95% CI 3.31-27.86]; p<0.0001). Response to eltrombopag compared with placebo was not affected by predefined study stratification variables (baseline platelet counts, concomitant ITP drugs, and splenectomy status) or by the number of previous ITP treatments. Of the 34 patients in the efficacy analysis who increased their dose of eltrombopag, ten (29%) responded. Platelet counts generally returned to baseline values within 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Patients receiving eltrombopag had less bleeding at any time during the study than did those receiving placebo (OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.26-0.89]; p=0.021). The frequency of grade 3-4 adverse events during treatment (eltrombopag, two [3%]; placebo, one [3%]) and adverse events leading to study discontinuation (eltrombopag, three [4%]; placebo, two [5%]), were similar in both groups.

"Trastuzumab plus vinorelbine or taxane chemotherapy for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer: the trastuzumab and vinorelbine or taxane study. The optimal trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen for HER2-overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer is not known. The trastuzumab and vinorelbine or taxane (TRAVIOTA) study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial that was designed to compare these regimens. Eligible patients had HER2-overexpressing, metastatic breast cancer and had received no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either trastuzumab with weekly vinorelbine therapy or weekly taxane therapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel at the investigator's choice). Originally planned for 250 patients, the study was closed because of poor accrual with 81 evaluable patients, including 41 patients who received vinorelbine and 40 patients who received taxane. Response rates were 51% and 40% for the vinorelbine/trastuzumab arm and the taxane/trastuzumab arm, respectively (Fisher exact test; P = .37). The median time to disease progression was 8.5 months and 6.0 months for the vinorelbine- and taxane-based arms, respectively (log-rank test; P = .09). Treatment with either regimen generally was well tolerated, yielding comparable rates of neurologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Vinorelbine-based treatment was associated with more anemia and neutropenia and with 2 episodes of cardiotoxicity. Taxane-based therapy was associated with more dermatologic toxicity, myalgias, and fluid retention. Both vinorelbine/trastuzumab and taxane/trastuzumab treatments were active as first-line therapy for HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer and had comparable rates of efficacy and tolerability. The toxicities observed were the result of recognized side effects associated with each of the chemotherapy agents and schedules.

"Randomized Trial of Systemic Therapy After Involved-Field Radiotherapy in Patients With Early-Stage Follicular Lymphoma: TROG 99.03. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is curable by involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) in < 50% of patients with stage I to II disease. We hypothesized that adding systemic therapy to IFRT would improve long-term progression-free survival (PFS). A multicenter randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with stage I to II low-grade FL after staging computed tomography scans and bone marrow biopsies. <sup>18</sup>F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) was not mandatory. Patients were randomly assigned to either arm A (30 Gy IFRT alone) or arm B (IFRT plus six cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone [CVP]). From 2006, rituximab was added to arm B (R-CVP). Between 2000 and 2012, 150 patients were enrolled, 75 per arm. In arm B, 44 patients were allocated to receive CVP and 31 were allocated to receive R-CVP. At randomization, 75% had stage I, the median age was 57 years, 52% were male, and 48% were PET staged. With a median follow-up of 9.6 years (range, 3.1 to 15.8 years), PFS was superior in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.95; P = .033). Ten-year PFS rates were 59% (95% CI, 46% to 74%) and 41% (95% CI, 30% to 57%) for arms B and A, respectively. Patients in arm B who received R-CVP had markedly superior PFS compared with contemporaneous patients in arm A (hazard ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.97; P = .045). Fewer involved regions ( P = .047) and PET staging ( P = .056) were associated with better PFS. Histologic transformation occurred in four and 10 patients in arms B and A, respectively ( P = .1).

"Uracil-tegafur and tamoxifen vs cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and tamoxifen in post-operative adjuvant therapy for stage I, II, or IIIA lymph node-positive breast cancer: a comparative study. It has been reported that treatment with uracil-tegafur (UFT) has shown significantly better survival and relapse-free survival (RFS) than surgery alone. Therefore, we compared UFT with a combination therapy of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) in patients who had undergone curative surgery for axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer. A total of 377 node-positive patients with stage I, II, or IIIA disease were registered from September 1996 through July 2000 and were randomly assigned to either 6 cycles of CMF or 2 years of UFT. In both arms, tamoxifen (TAM) was concurrently administered for 2 years. The primary end point in this study was the non-inferiority of UFT to CMF. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed with regard to the 5-year RFS rate (72.2% in the UFT and 76.3% in the CMF). Adverse event profiles differed between the two groups, with a significantly lower incidence of leukopenia and anaemia in the UFT group, as well as anorexia, nausea/vomiting, stomatitis, and alopecia, which have implications for quality of life. UFT administered in combination with TAM holds promise in the treatment of lymph node-positive early breast cancer. On stratified analysis, the recurrence rate in the UFT group was found to be better in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients. Tegafur-based treatment should be evaluated by a prospective randomised trial conducted in ER-positive patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19638976/,19638976,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen compared to CMFT when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen versus CMFT in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen and CMFT for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen versus CMFT in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen when compared with CMFT for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen in comparison to CMFT for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen compared to CMFT for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen and CMFT in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen against CMFT for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen compared to CMFT in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen contrasted with CMFT in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen versus CMFT for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen and CMFT in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen as opposed to CMFT in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen compared to CMFT in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how UFT and Tamoxifen compares to CMFT in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen in relation to CMFT for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of UFT and Tamoxifen versus CMFT for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of UFT and Tamoxifen's efficacy in comparison with CMFT in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of UFT and Tamoxifen against CMFT regarding Breast cancer.,3,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00152178,"{""19638976"": ""Y Park|K Okamura|S Mitsuyama|T Saito|J Koh|S Kyono|K Higaki|M Ogita|T Asaga|H Inaji|H Komichi|N Kohno|K Yamazaki|F Tanaka|T Ito|H Nishikawa|A Osaki|H Koyama|T Suzuki""}",1996-07,Yes,Yes,Intravenous|Oral,Antimetabolites
"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with nedaplatin versus cisplatin in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trial. Cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is currently considered to be the standard treatment regimen for patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but has well known side-effects such as gastrointestinal reactions, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Nedaplatin was developed to decrease the toxic effects induced by cisplatin, and in this trial we assessed whether a nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen was non-inferior to a cisplatin-based regimen in patients with locoregional, stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We did an open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial at two centres in China. Patients aged 18-65 years with non-keratinising stage II-IVB (T1-4N1-3 or T3-4N0) nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a Karnofsky score of at least 70, and adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenously either nedaplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 22, and 43 for three cycles concurrently with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Randomisation was done manually using a computer-generated random number code and patients were stratified by treatment centre and clinical stage. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 2 years; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in 2-year progression-free survival between the two groups did not exceed 10%. Analyses were by both intention to treat and per protocol, including all patients who received at least one complete cycle of chemotherapy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01540136, and is currently in follow-up. Between Jan 16, 2012, and July 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 402 patients to nedaplatin-based (n=201) or cisplatin-based (n=201) concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In the intention-to-treat population, 2-year progression-free survival was 89·9% (95% CI 85·8-94·0) in the cisplatin group and 88·0% (83·5-94·5) in the nedaplatin group, with a difference of 1·9% (95% CI -4·2 to 8·0; p<sub>non-inferiority</sub>=0·0048). In the per-protocol analysis (cisplatin group, n=197; nedaplatin group, n=196), 2-year progression-free survival was 89·7% (95% CI 85·4-94·0) in the cisplatin group and 88·7% (84·2-94·5) in the nedaplatin group, with a difference of 1·0% (95% CI -5·2 to 7·0; p<sub>non-inferiority</sub>=0·0020). A significantly higher frequency of grade 3 or 4 vomiting (35 [18%] of 198 in the cisplatin group vs 12 [6%] of 200 in the nedaplatin group, p<0·0001), nausea (18 [9%] vs four [2%], p=0·0021), and anorexia (53 [27%] vs 26 [13%], p=0·00070) was observed in the cisplatin group compared with the nedaplatin group. 11 (6%) patients in the nedaplatin group had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared with four (2%) in the cisplatin group (p=0·065). Patients in the cisplatin group had a higher frequency of any grade or grade 3 or 4 late auditory or hearing toxicities than did patients in the nedaplatin group (grade 3 or 4: three [2%] in the nedaplatin group vs 11 [6%] in the cisplatin group, p=0·030). No patients died from treatment-related causes. Our findings show that nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy represents an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locoregional, advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Further investigations are needed to explore the potential use of this treatment as induction or adjuvant chemotherapy or in combination with other agents.

"Survival advantage for irinotecan versus best supportive care as second-line chemotherapy in gastric cancer--a randomised phase III study of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie (AIO). The value of second-line therapy for metastatic gastric cancer is unclear. So far there are no randomised phase III data comparing second-line chemotherapy to best supportive care (BSC). In this prospective, multicenter, open label, randomised phase III study we compared irinotecan to BSC to evaluate the impact on survival of second-line chemotherapy. Eligible patients (pts) had metastatic or locally advanced gastro-oesophageal junction or gastric adenocarcinoma, objective tumour progression during or within 6months after first-line chemotherapy and ECOG performance status 0-2. Stratification for time of progression after first-line therapy, ECOG PS and pretreatment secured even distribution of important prognostic factors. Arm A: Irinotecan 250mg/m(2)q3w (first cycle) to be increased to 350mg/m(2), depending on toxicity. Arm B: BSC. Between 10/2002 and 12/2006 40 pts were randomised. The study was closed prematurely due to poor accrual. Responsefor arm A (19 pts evaluable): No objective responses, SD 53%, PD 47%. Improvement of tumour related symptoms: Arm A 50% of pts, arm B 7%. Overall Survival: (all events in 40 pts have occurred): The hazard ratio for death was reduced to 0.48 (95%CI 0.25-0.92) in the irinotecan-arm (p=0.012). Median survival arm A: 4.0months (95% CI 3.6-7.5), arm B: 2.4months (95% CI 1.7-4.9).

"Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries. Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041404. 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18.6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.60-0.91; p=0.0046).

"Carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide (KRdc) as induction therapy for transplant-eligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients (Myeloma XI+): Interim analysis of an open-label randomised controlled trial. Carfilzomib is a second-generation irreversible proteasome inhibitor that is efficacious in the treatment of myeloma and carries less risk of peripheral neuropathy than first-generation proteasome inhibitors, making it more amenable to combination therapy. The Myeloma XI+ trial recruited patients from 88 sites across the UK between 5 December 2013 and 20 April 2016. Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for transplantation were randomly assigned to receive the combination carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide (KRdc) or a triplet of lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide (Rdc) or thalidomide, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide (Tdc). All patients were planned to receive an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) prior to a randomisation between lenalidomide maintenance and observation. Eligible patients were aged over 18 years and had symptomatic myeloma. The co-primary endpoints for the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for KRdc versus the Tdc/Rdc control group by intention to treat. PFS, response, and safety outcomes are reported following a planned interim analysis. The trial is registered (ISRCTN49407852) and has completed recruitment. In total, 1,056 patients (median age 61 years, range 33 to 75, 39.1% female) underwent induction randomisation to KRdc (n = 526) or control (Tdc/Rdc, n = 530). After a median follow-up of 34.5 months, KRdc was associated with a significantly longer PFS than the triplet control group (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.76). The median PFS for patients receiving KRdc is not yet estimable, versus 36.2 months for the triplet control group (p < 0.001). Improved PFS was consistent across subgroups of patients including those with genetically high-risk disease. At the end of induction, the percentage of patients achieving at least a very good partial response was 82.3% in the KRdc group versus 58.9% in the control group (odds ratio 4.35, 95% CI 3.19-5.94, p < 0.001). Minimal residual disease negativity (cutoff 4 × 10-5 bone marrow leucocytes) was achieved in 55% of patients tested in the KRdc group at the end of induction, increasing to 75% of those tested after ASCT. The most common adverse events were haematological, with a low incidence of cardiac events. The trial continues to follow up patients to the co-primary endpoint of OS and for planned long-term follow-up analysis. Limitations of the study include a lack of blinding to treatment regimen and that the triplet control regimen did not include a proteasome inhibitor for all patients, which would be considered a current standard of care in many parts of the world.

"Azacitidine and Venetoclax in Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a dismal prognosis, even after treatment with a hypomethylating agent. Azacitidine added to venetoclax had promising efficacy in a previous phase 1b study. We randomly assigned previously untreated patients with confirmed AML who were ineligible for standard induction therapy because of coexisting conditions, because they were 75 years of age or older, or both to azacitidine plus either venetoclax or placebo. All patients received a standard dose of azacitidine (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1 through 7 every 28-day cycle); venetoclax (target dose, 400 mg) or matching placebo was administered orally, once daily, in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was overall survival. The intention-to-treat population included 431 patients (286 in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 145 in the azacitidine-placebo [control] group). The median age was 76 years in both groups (range, 49 to 91). At a median follow-up of 20.5 months, the median overall survival was 14.7 months in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 9.6 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.85; P<0.001). The incidence of complete remission was higher with azacitidine-venetoclax than with the control regimen (36.7% vs. 17.9%; P<0.001), as was the composite complete remission (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) (66.4% vs. 28.3%; P<0.001). Key adverse events included nausea of any grade (in 44% of the patients in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 35% of those in the control group) and grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia (in 45% and 38%, respectively), neutropenia (in 42% and 28%), and febrile neutropenia (in 42% and 19%). Infections of any grade occurred in 85% of the patients in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 67% of those in the control group, and serious adverse events occurred in 83% and 73%, respectively. In previously untreated patients who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, overall survival was longer and the incidence of remission was higher among patients who received azacitidine plus venetoclax than among those who received azacitidine alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the venetoclax-azacitidine group than in the control group.

"FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab versus FOLFOX plus bevacizumab for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ≥3 circulating tumour cells: the randomised phase III VISNÚ-1 trial. 5-Fluorouracil/leucovorin, oxaliplatin, irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) plus bevacizumab is more effective than doublets plus bevacizumab as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, but is not widely used because of concerns about toxicity and lack of predictive biomarkers. This study was designed to explore the role of circulating tumour cell (CTC) count as a biomarker to select patients for therapy with FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab. VISNÚ-1 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase III study in patients with previously untreated, unresectable, metastatic colorectal carcinoma and ≥3 CTC/7.5 mL blood. Patients received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg plus FOLFOXIRI (irinotecan 165 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, leucovorin 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 5-fluorouracil 3200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or FOLFOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, leucovorin 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> then 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) by intravenous administration every 2 weeks. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). The intention-to-treat population comprised 349 patients (FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab, n=172; FOLFOX-bevacizumab, n=177). Median PFS was 12.4 months (95% CI 11.2 to 14.0) with FOLFOXIRI bevacizumab and 9.3 months (95% CI 8.5 to 10.7) with FOLFOX-bevacizumab (stratified HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.82; p=0.0006). Grade≥3 adverse events were more common with FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab 85.3% vs 75.1% with FOLFOX-bevacizumab (p=0.0178).

"Defibrotide for prophylaxis of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in paediatric haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation: an open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed to assess whether defibrotide can reduce the incidence of veno-occlusive disease in this setting. In our phase 3 open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients at 28 European university hospitals or academic medical centres. Eligible patients were younger than 18 years, had undergone myeloablative conditioning before allogeneic or autologous HSCT, and had one or more risk factor for veno-occlusive disease based on modified Seattle criteria. We centrally assigned eligible participants on the basis of a computer-generated randomisation sequence (1:1), stratified by centre and presence of osteopetrosis, to receive intravenous defibrotide prophylaxis (treatment group) or not (control group). The primary endpoint was incidence of veno-occlusive disease by 30 days after HSCT, adjudicated by a masked, independent review committee, in eligible patients who consented to randomisation (intention-to-treat population), and was assessed with a competing risk approach. Patients in either group who developed veno-occlusive disease received defibrotide for treatment. We assessed adverse events to 180 days after HSCT in all patients who received allocated prophylaxis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00272948. Between Jan 25, 2006, and Jan 29, 2009, we enrolled 356 eligible patients to the intention-to-treat population. 22 (12%) of 180 patients randomly allocated to the defibrotide group had veno-occlusive disease by 30 days after HSCT compared with 35 (20%) of 176 controls (risk difference -7·7%, 95% CI -15·3 to -0·1; Z test for competing risk analysis p=0·0488; log-rank test p=0·0507). 154 (87%) of 177 patients in the defibrotide group had adverse events by day 180 compared with 155 (88%) of 176 controls. Defibrotide prophylaxis seems to reduce incidence of veno-occlusive disease and is well tolerated. Thus, such prophylaxis could present a useful clinical option for this serious complication of HSCT.

"FOLFOXIRI Plus Panitumumab As First-Line Treatment of <i>RAS</i> Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: The Randomized, Open-Label, Phase II VOLFI Study (AIO KRK0109). This trial investigated the addition of panitumumab to triplet chemotherapy with fluorouracil/folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) in a two-to-one randomized, controlled, open-label, phase II trial in patients with untreated <i>RAS</i> wild-type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST (version 1.1). The experimental arm (modified FOLFOXIRI [mFOLFOXIRI] plus panitumumab) was considered active if the ORR was ≥ 75%. The experimental ORR was compared with an estimated ORR of 60% based on historical data, verified by a randomized control group (FOLFOXIRI). The power of the trial was 80%, with a potential type I error of 0.05. Secondary end points included secondary resection rate, toxicity, progression-free survival, and overall survival. A total of 63 patients were randomly assigned to the experimental arm and 33 patients to the control arm. The ORR of the mFOLFOXIRI plus panitumumab arm exceeded 75% and was higher when compared with that of FOLFOXIRI (87.3% <i>v</i> 60.6%; odds ratio, 4.469; 95% CI, 1.61 to 12.38; <i>P</i> = .004). The secondary resection rate was improved with the addition of panitumumab (33.3% <i>v</i> 12.1%; <i>P</i> = .02). Progression-free survival was similar in the study arms, whereas overall survival showed a trend in favor of the panitumumab-containing arm (hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.11; <i>P</i> = .12). The addition of panitumumab to mFOLFOXIRI in patients with <i>RAS</i> WT metastatic colorectal cancer improved the ORR and rate of secondary resection of metastases and represents a treatment option in selected and fit patients in need of highly active first-line therapy.

"Aspirin for preventing the recurrence of venous thromboembolism. About 20% of patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a recurrence within 2 years after the withdrawal of oral anticoagulant therapy. Extending anticoagulation prevents recurrences but is associated with increased bleeding. The benefit of aspirin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism is unknown. In this multicenter, investigator-initiated, double-blind study, patients with first-ever unprovoked venous thromboembolism who had completed 6 to 18 months of oral anticoagulant treatment were randomly assigned to aspirin, 100 mg daily, or placebo for 2 years, with the option of extending the study treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrence of venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding was the primary safety outcome. Venous thromboembolism recurred in 28 of the 205 patients who received aspirin and in 43 of the 197 patients who received placebo (6.6% vs. 11.2% per year; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.93) (median study period, 24.6 months).

One patient in each treatment group had a major bleeding episode. Adverse events were similar in the two groups. Aspirin reduced the risk of recurrence when given to patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who had discontinued anticoagulant treatment, with no apparent increase in the risk of major bleeding.

"De-Escalation Strategies in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Early Breast Cancer (BC): Final Analysis of the West German Study Group Adjuvant Dynamic Marker-Adjusted Personalized Therapy Trial Optimizing Risk Assessment and Therapy Response Prediction in Early BC HER2- and Hormone Receptor-Positive Phase II Randomized Trial-Efficacy, Safety, and Predictive Markers for 12 Weeks of Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab Emtansine With or Without Endocrine Therapy (ET) Versus Trastuzumab Plus ET. Purpose Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive/hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer is a distinct subgroup associated with lower chemotherapy sensitivity and slightly better outcome than HER2-positive/HR-negative disease. Little is known about the efficacy of the combination of endocrine therapy (ET) with trastuzumab or with the potent antibody-cytotoxic, anti-HER2 compound trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with or without ET for this subgroup. The West German Study Group trial, ADAPT (Adjuvant Dynamic Marker-Adjusted Personalized Therapy Trial Optimizing Risk Assessment and Therapy Response Prediction in Early Breast Cancer) compares pathologic complete response (pCR) rates of T-DM1 versus trastuzumab with ET in early HER2-positive/HR-positive breast cancer. Patients and Methods In this prospective, neoadjuvant, phase II trial, 375 patients with early breast cancer with HER2-positive and HR-positive status (n = 463 screened) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of T-DM1 with or without ET or to trastuzumab with ET. The primary end point was pCR (ypT0/is/ypN0). Early response was assessed in 3-week post-therapeutic core biopsies (proliferation decrease ≥ 30% Ki-67 or cellularity response). Secondary end points included safety and predictive impact of early response on pCR. Adjuvant therapy followed national standards. Results Baseline characteristics were well balanced among the arms. More than 90% of patients completed the therapy per protocol. pCR was observed in 41.0% of patients treated with T-DM1, 41.5% of patients treated with T-DM1 and ET, and 15.1% with trastuzumab and ET ( P < .001). Early responders (67% of patients with assessable response) achieved pCR in 35.7% compared with 19.8% in nonresponders (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.19). T-DM1 was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of grade 1 to 2 toxicities, especially thrombocytopenia, nausea, and elevation of liver enzymes. Overall toxicity was low; seventeen therapy-related severe adverse events (T-DM1 arms v trastuzumab plus ET; 5.3% v 3.1%, respectively) were reported. Conclusion The ADAPT HER2-positive/HR-positive trial demonstrates that neoadjuvant T-DM1 (with or without ET) given for only 12 weeks results in a clinically meaningful pCR rate. Thus, a substantial number of patients are spared the adverse effects of systemic chemotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28682681/,28682681,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of T-DM1 and ET compared to Trastuzumab and ET when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET versus Trastuzumab and ET in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of T-DM1 and ET and Trastuzumab and ET for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET versus Trastuzumab and ET in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of T-DM1 and ET when compared with Trastuzumab and ET for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET in comparison to Trastuzumab and ET for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of T-DM1 and ET compared to Trastuzumab and ET for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET and Trastuzumab and ET in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of T-DM1 and ET against Trastuzumab and ET for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET compared to Trastuzumab and ET in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of T-DM1 and ET contrasted with Trastuzumab and ET in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET versus Trastuzumab and ET for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of T-DM1 and ET and Trastuzumab and ET in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET as opposed to Trastuzumab and ET in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of T-DM1 and ET compared to Trastuzumab and ET in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how T-DM1 and ET compares to Trastuzumab and ET in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of T-DM1 and ET in relation to Trastuzumab and ET for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of T-DM1 and ET versus Trastuzumab and ET for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of T-DM1 and ET's efficacy in comparison with Trastuzumab and ET in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of T-DM1 and ET against Trastuzumab and ET regarding Breast cancer.,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01817452,"{""28682681"": ""Nadia Harbeck|Oleg Gluz|Matthias Christgen|Ronald Ernest Kates|Michael Braun|Sherko Küemmel|Claudia Schumacher|Jochem Potenberg|Stefan Kraemer|Anke Kleine-Tebbe|Doris Augustin|Bahriye Aktas|Helmut Forstbauer|Joke Tio|Raquel von Schumann|Cornelia Liedtke|Eva-Maria Grischke|Johannes Schumacher|Rachel Wuerstlein|Hans Heinrich Kreipe|Ulrike Anneliese Nitz""}",2014-03,Yes,No,Intravenous,Chemotherapy|Taxanes|Monoclonal Antibodies
"Results of a randomized trial of chlorambucil versus fludarabine for patients with untreated Waldenström macroglobulinemia, marginal zone lymphoma, or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Treatment options for patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) and closely related disorders include alkylating agents, purine analogs, and monoclonal antibodies. No large randomized studies have yet been reported comparing any of these approaches. The randomized WM1 study (Trial Comparing Chlorambucil to Fludarabine in Patients With Advanced Waldenström Macroglobulinemia) was undertaken in 101 centers in five countries enrolling 414 eligible patients (339 with WM, 37 with non-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue marginal zone lymphoma, and 38 with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) who were randomly assigned to receive chlorambucil or fludarabine. The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR). On the basis of intent-to-treat analysis, the ORR was 47.8% (95% CI, 40.9% to 54.8%) in the fludarabine arm versus 38.6% (95% CI, 32.0% to 45.7%) in the chlorambucil arm (P = .07). With a median follow-up of 36 months (interquartile range, 18 to 58 months), median progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DR) were significantly improved in the fludarabine arm compared with the chlorambucil arm: PFS, 36.3 versus 27.1 months (P = .012) and DR, 38.3 versus 19.9 months (P < .001). In patients with WM, median overall survival (OS) was not reached in the fludarabine arm versus 69.8 months in the chlorambucil arm (95% CI, 61.6 to 79.8 months; P = .014). Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was significantly higher among patients treated with fludarabine (36%) compared with patients treated with chlorambucil (17.8%; P < .001). Second malignancies were significantly more frequent in the chlorambucil arm with 6-year cumulative incidence rate of 20.6% versus 3.7% in the fludarabine arm (P = .001).

"A randomized study (WOS MM1) comparing the oral regime Z-Dex (idarubicin and dexamethasone) with vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone as induction therapy for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. Whilst infusional vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD) is an effective treatment for patients with multiple myeloma (MM), administration may be complicated by line-associated infections and thromboses. The oral regime, Z-Dex (idarubicin and dexamethasone) has been shown to be efficacious in MM. We conducted a randomized study comparing Z-Dex with VAD as induction therapy in newly diagnosed MM patients. A total of 106 patients (median age, 56 years; range: 37-73; Durie-Salmon stage II/III) were randomized to receive four to six cycles of Z-Dex or VAD. Central line complications were reported in 38 patients on 57 cycles, primarily because of infection. Neutropenia (all grades) was more common in the Z-Dex arm (P = 0.009) although grade III/IV neutropenia was not significantly different between the treatment groups (P = 0.06). Infections (all grades) were more commonly seen in the VAD arm (P = 0.001) although grade III/IV infections were not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.081). The responses to therapy (complete/partial response) in evaluable patients were: VAD 74% vs. Z-Dex 58%, with an estimated difference in response of 16% (95% CI -2-33, P = 0.075). VAD recipients (15%) suffered early treatment-related mortality compared with 12% of Z-Dex recipients. Overall, 45 patients have died: disease progression (Z-Dex n = 13, VAD n = 10), regimen-related toxicity (Z-Dex n = 2, VAD n = 2), infection (Z-Dex n = 0, VAD n = 3), other causes (Z-Dex n = 7, VAD n = 2), unknown (Z-Dex n = 3, VAD n = 2).

"Nab-paclitaxel weekly versus dose-dense solvent-based paclitaxel followed by dose-dense epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide in high-risk HR+/HER2- early breast cancer: results from the neoadjuvant part of the WSG-ADAPT-HR+/HER2- trial. In high-risk hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) early breast cancer (EBC), nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel showed promising efficacy versus solvent-based (sb)-paclitaxel in neoadjuvant trials; however, optimal patient and therapy selection remains a topic of ongoing research. Here, we investigate the potential of Oncotype DX® recurrence score (RS) and endocrine therapy (ET) response (low post-endocrine Ki67) for therapy selection. Within the WSG-ADAPT trial (NCT01779206), high-risk HR+/HER2- EBC patients were randomized to (neo)adjuvant 4× sb-paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q2w or 8× nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q1w, followed by 4× epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (90 mg + 600 mg) q2w; inclusion criteria: (i) cN0-1, RS 12-25, and post-ET Ki67 >10%; (ii) cN0-1 with RS >25. Patients with cN2-3 or (G3, baseline Ki67 ≥40%, and tumor size >1 cm) were allowed to be included without RS and/or ET response testing. Associations of key factors with pathological complete response (pCR) (primary) and survival (secondary) endpoints were analyzed using statistical mediation and moderation models. Eight hundred and sixty-four patients received neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel (n= 437) or sb-paclitaxel (n = 427); nab-paclitaxel was superior for pCR (20.8% versus 12.9%, P = 0.002). pCR was higher for RS >25 versus RS ≤25 (16.0% versus 8.4%, P = 0.021) and for ET non-response versus ET response (15.1% versus 6.0%, P = 0.027); no factors were predictive for the relative efficacy of nab-paclitaxel versus sb-paclitaxel. Patients with pCR had longer distant disease-free survival [dDFS; hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.91, P = 0.024]. Despite favorable prognostic association of RS >25 versus RS ≤25 with pCR (odds ratio 3.11, 95% CI 1.71-5.63, P ≤ 0.001), higher RS was unfavorably associated with dDFS (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, P = 0.010). In high-risk HR+/HER2- EBC, neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel q1w appears superior to sb-paclitaxel q2w regarding pCR. Combining RS and ET response assessment appears to select patients with highest pCR rates. The disadvantage of higher RS for dDFS is reduced in patients with pCR. These are the first results from a large neoadjuvant randomized trial supporting the use of RS to help select patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk HR+/HER2- EBC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37062416/,37062416,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of ddT-ddEC compared to nP-ddEC when used to treat Breast cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of ddT-ddEC versus nP-ddEC in treating Breast cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of ddT-ddEC and nP-ddEC for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of ddT-ddEC versus nP-ddEC in treating Breast cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of ddT-ddEC when compared with nP-ddEC for Breast cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of ddT-ddEC in comparison to nP-ddEC for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of ddT-ddEC compared to nP-ddEC for addressing Breast cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of ddT-ddEC and nP-ddEC in the treatment of Breast cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of ddT-ddEC against nP-ddEC for managing Breast cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of ddT-ddEC compared to nP-ddEC in treating Breast cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of ddT-ddEC contrasted with nP-ddEC in relation to Breast cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of ddT-ddEC versus nP-ddEC for treating Breast cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of ddT-ddEC and nP-ddEC in treating Breast cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of ddT-ddEC as opposed to nP-ddEC in managing Breast cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of ddT-ddEC compared to nP-ddEC in the context of Breast cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how ddT-ddEC compares to nP-ddEC in terms of effectiveness for Breast cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of ddT-ddEC in relation to nP-ddEC for the treatment of Breast cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of ddT-ddEC versus nP-ddEC for managing Breast cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of ddT-ddEC's efficacy in comparison with nP-ddEC in treating Breast cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of ddT-ddEC against nP-ddEC regarding Breast cancer.,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT01779206,"{""37062416"": ""O Gluz|S Kuemmel|U Nitz|M Braun|K Lüdtke-Heckenkamp|R von Schumann|M Darsow|H Forstbauer|J Potenberg|C Uleer|E M Grischke|B Aktas|C Schumacher|C Zu Eulenburg|R Kates|K Jóźwiak|M Graeser|R Wuerstlein|R Baehner|M Christgen|H H Kreipe|N Harbeck""}",2012-05,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Chemotherapy|Taxanes|Monoclonal Antibodies
"Comparison of Neoadjuvant Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin vs Nab-Paclitaxel+Gemcitabine in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Randomized WSG-ADAPT-TN Trial Results. Pathological complete response (pCR) is associated with improved prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The optimal chemotherapy regimen is unclear. Weekly nab-paclitaxel vs conventional paclitaxel or addition of carboplatin to anthracycline-taxane results in higher pCR rates with uncertain survival impact. We evaluated carboplatin vs gemcitabine with a nab-paclitaxel backbone as a short 12-week A-free regimen with a focus on early response. Patients with TNBC (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor < 1%, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, cT1c-cT4c, cN0/+) were randomly assigned to A: nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2/gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 d1,8 three times weekly (q3w); vs B: nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2/carboplatin AUC2 day 1,8 q3w. The trial was powered for a pCR (ypT0/is ypN0) comparison by therapy arm and early response (defined as Ki-67 decrease >30% or < 500 invasive tumor cells in the three-week serial biopsy). All statistical tests were two-sided. A total of 336 patients were enrolled (48 centers, arms A/B: n = 182/154). The median age was 50 years. At baseline (A vs B), 62.6% and 62.9% had cT2-4c tumors; 86.8% and 90.9% completed therapy per protocol, respectively. pCR favored arm B (28.7%, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.36, vs 45.9%, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.54; 95% CI(dBA) = 6.2% to 27.9%, P = .002) and was lower in nonresponders than in early responders (19.5% vs 44.4%, P < .001) or in patients with unclassifiable early response (50.0%). The nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine was associated with more frequent dose reductions (20.6% vs 11.9%, P = .04), treatment-related serious adverse events (11.1% vs 5.3%, P = .07), grade 3-4 infections (7.2% vs 2.6%, P = .07), and grade 3-4 ALAT elevations (11.7 vs 3.3%, P = .01). This first large randomized trial suggests high efficacy and excellent tolerability of a neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen, superior to nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine in TNBC. De-escalation of further chemotherapy in patients with early pCR after a short anthracycline-free regimen is a promising field of future research.

"A phase III multicenter, randomized, controlled study of combined androgen blockade with versus without zoledronic acid in prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone disease: results of the ZAPCA trial. To examine the antitumor activity of zoledronic acid (ZA) combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with treatment-naive prostate cancer and bone metastasis. We enrolled 227 men with treatment-naive prostate cancer and bone metastasis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive combined androgen blockade alone (CAB group) or ZA with combined androgen blockade (CZ group). Time to treatment failure (TTTF), time to the first skeletal-related event (TTfSRE), and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Median follow-up duration was 41.5 months. Median TTTFs were 12.4 and 9.7 months for the CZ and CAB groups, respectively (HR 0.75; 95 % CI 0.57-1.00; p = 0.051).

At the time of the final analysis, 377 patients had died. Median OS was 22.3 weeks for NOL and 32.3 weeks for DOX (P = .0068). The hazard ratio was 0.753 in favor of DOX. Objective response rate (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) was 1.4% for NOL and 4.0% for DOX. Median PFS was 12 weeks for NOL and 10 weeks for DOX (P = .7091). Median time to treatment failure was 8.4 weeks for NOL and 9.1 weeks for DOX (P = .0969). Grade 3 and 4 stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia were more common in the NOL arm. Alopecia was more common in the DOX arm. More patients were withdrawn from study for toxicity in the NOL arm than in the DOX arm. NOL showed minimal activity in this phase III trial.

"Efficacy of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With S-1 vs Radiotherapy Alone for Older Patients With Esophageal Cancer: A Multicenter Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Trial. Most older patients with esophageal cancer cannot complete the standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). An effective and tolerable chemoradiotherapy regimen for older patients is needed. To evaluate the efficacy and toxic effects of CCRT with S-1 vs radiotherapy (RT) alone in older patients with esophageal cancer. A randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 23 Chinese centers between June 1, 2016, and August 31, 2018. The study enrolled 298 patients aged 70 to 85 years. Eligible participants had histologically confirmed esophageal cancer, stage IB to IVB disease based on the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (stage IVB: only metastasis to the supraclavicular/celiac lymph nodes) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2020, to March 10, 2021. Patients were stratified according to age (<80 vs ≥80 years) and tumor length (<5 vs ≥5 cm) and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either CCRT with S-1 or RT alone. The primary end point was the 2-year overall survival rate using intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 298 patients enrolled, 180 (60.4%) were men. The median age was 77 (interquartile range, 74-79) years in the CCRT group and 77 (interquartile range, 74-80) years in the RT alone group. A total of 151 patients (50.7%) had stage III or IV disease. The CCRT group had a significantly higher complete response rate than the RT group (41.6% vs 26.8%; P = .007). Surviving patients had a median follow-up of 33.9 months (interquartile range: 28.5-38.2 months), and the CCRT group had a significantly higher 2-year overall survival rate (53.2% vs 35.8%; hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.85; P = .002). There were no significant differences in the incidence of grade 3 or higher toxic effects between the CCRT and RT groups except that grade 3 or higher leukopenia occurred in more patients in the CCRT group (9.5% vs 2.7%; P = .01). Treatment-related deaths were observed in 3 patients (2.0%) in the CCRT group and 4 patients (2.7%) in the RT group. In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, CCRT with S-1 was tolerable and provided significant benefits over RT alone in older patients with esophageal cancer.

"A multicenter international randomized phase III study comparing cisplatin in combination with irinotecan or etoposide in previously untreated small-cell lung cancer patients with extensive disease. This study compared irinotecan plus cisplatin (IP) with etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) in small-cell lung cancer patients with extensive disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) and either irinotecan 65 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8 or etoposide 100 mg/m(2), days 1-3, every 3 weeks. Baseline characteristics were balanced between patients receiving IP (N = 202) or EP (N = 203). Median overall survival was nonsignificantly superior for patients receiving IP versus EP, 10.2 versus 9.7 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-1.01, P = 0.06] and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 41.9% versus 38.9% and 16.3% versus 8.2%, respectively. Noninferiority of IP versus EP was established, upper bound of the 95% CI of HR 1.01 (prespecified margin IP/EP <1.25). Overall response (39.1% versus 46.6%) and time to tumor progression (5.4 versus 6.2 months) were not superior for IP. Grade 3/4 vomiting (10.9% versus 4.4%) and diarrhea (15.4% versus 0.5%) were more common in the IP versus EP arm; grade 3/4 neutropenia was more frequent in the EP (59.6%) versus IP arm (38.1%). Our data demonstrate the noninferiority of IP versus EP for survival in primarily Western patients with SCLC-ED. A meta-analysis is required to finally assess the role of irinotecan in this setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20231298/,20231298,Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) when used to treat Small cell lung cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) and Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) when compared with Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for Small cell lung cancer?,Pick the option that most clearly describes the effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) in comparison to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that best encapsulates the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for addressing Small cell lung cancer.,Which choice most accurately depicts the effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) and Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in the treatment of Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the choice that most effectively represents the comparative efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) against Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for managing Small cell lung cancer.,Choose the statement that best conveys the relative effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,What option best characterizes the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) contrasted with Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in relation to Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the best representation of the effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for treating Small cell lung cancer.,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) and Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the description that best reflects the comparative effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) as opposed to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in managing Small cell lung cancer.,Select the best choice that illustrates the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in the context of Small cell lung cancer.,What option most accurately summarizes how Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) compares to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in terms of effectiveness for Small cell lung cancer?,Choose the option that most effectively highlights the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) in relation to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for the treatment of Small cell lung cancer.,Which option best outlines the effectiveness of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) versus Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) for managing Small cell lung cancer?,Identify the option that conveys the most accurate assessment of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC)'s efficacy in comparison with Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating Small cell lung cancer.,Select the statement that appropriately describes the comparative efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IC) against Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) regarding Small cell lung cancer.,3,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT00143455,"{""20231298"": ""P Zatloukal|F Cardenal|A Szczesna|V Gorbunova|V Moiseyenko|X Zhang|L Cisar|J-C Soria|M Domine|M Thomas""}",2002-06,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Platinum-based Chemotherapy
