"Thalidomide maintenance treatment increases progression-free but not overall survival in elderly patients with myeloma. Thalidomide maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation resulted in increased progression-free survival and overall survival in a few trials, but its role in non-transplant eligible patients with multiple myeloma remains unclear. This study assessed the impact of thalidomide-interferon in comparison to interferon maintenance therapy in elderly patients with multiple myeloma. Of 289 elderly patients with multiple myeloma who were randomized to thalidomide-dexamethasone or melphalan-prednisolone induction therapy, 137 finally completed 9 cycles of induction therapy with stable disease or better and thereby qualified for maintenance treatment. Of these, 128 have been randomized to either thalidomide-interferon or interferon alone. Primary study endpoints were progression-free survival and response rates; secondary endpoints were overall survival, toxicity and quality of life. Thalidomide-interferon maintenance therapy led to a significantly longer progression-free survival compared to interferon (27.7 vs. 13.2 months, P=0.0068), but overall survival was similar in both groups (52.6 vs. 51.4 months, P=0.81) and did not differ between patients aged 75 years or older, or younger patients (P=0.39). Survival after disease progression tended to be shorter in patients on thalidomide-interferon maintenance therapy (P=0.056). Progression-free survival and overall survival tended to be shorter in patients with adverse cytogenetic (FISH) findings compared to the standard risk group but differences were not significant (P=0.084 and P=0.082, respectively). Patients on thalidomide-interferon presented with more neuropathy (P=0.0015), constipation (P=0.0004), skin toxicity (P=0.0041) and elevated creatinine (P=0.026). Thalidomide plus interferon maintenance therapy increased progression-free survival but not overall survival and was associated with slightly more toxicity than maintenance with interferon alone. (Thalidomide-dexamethasone compared with melphalan-prednisolone in elderly patients with multiple myeloma. We compared thalidomide-dexamethasone (TD) with melphalan-prednisolone (MP) in 289 elderly patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Patients received either thalidomide 200 mg plus dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1 to 4 and 15 to 18 on even cycles and days 1 to 4 on odd cycles, during a 28-day cycle or to melphalan 0.25 mg/kg and prednisolone 2 mg/kg orally on days 1 to 4 during a 28- to 42-day cycle. Patients achieving stable disease or better were randomly assigned to maintenance therapy with either thalidomide 100 mg daily and 3 MU interferon alpha-2b thrice weekly or to 3 MU interferon alpha-2b thrice weekly only. TD resulted in a higher proportion of complete and very good remissions (26% vs 13%; P=.006) and overall responses (68% vs 50%; P=.002) compared with MP. Time to progression (21.2 vs 29.1 months; P=.2), and progression-free survival was similar (16.7 vs 20.7 months; P=.1), but overall survival was significantly shorter in the TD group (41.5 vs 49.4 months; P=.024). Toxicity was higher with TD, particularly in patients older than 75 years with poor performance status.

"MABp1 as a novel antibody treatment for advanced colorectal cancer: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study. MABp1, an antibody that targets interleukin 1α, has been associated with antitumour activity and relief of debilitating symptoms in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. We sought to establish the effect of MABp1 with a new primary endpoint in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Eligible patients for the double-blind phase of this ongoing, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 trial, had metastatic or unresectable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 1 or 2, systemic inflammation, weight loss, and other disease-related morbidities associated with poor prognosis, and were refractory to oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either MABp1 or placebo. Randomisation codes were obtained from a centrally held list via an interactive web response system. Patients received an intravenous infusion of 7·5 mg/kg MABp1 or placebo given every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of MABp1 or placebo (modified intention-to-treat population), and was a composite of stable or increased lean body mass and stability or improvement in two of three symptoms (pain, fatigue, or anorexia) at week 8 compared with baseline measurements. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number. Patients were enrolled between May 20, 2014, and Sept 2, 2015. The double-blind phase of the study was completed on Nov 3, 2015. Of 333 patients randomly assigned treatment, 207 received at least one dose of MABp1 and 102 at least one dose of placebo. 68 (33%) and 19 (19%) patients, respectively, achieved the primary endpoint (relative risk 1·76, 95% CI 1·12-2·77, p=0·0045). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the MABp1 group compared with in the placebo group were anaemia (eight [4%] of 207 vs five [5%] of 102 patients), increased concentration of alkaline phosphatase (nine [4%] vs two [2%]), fatigue (six [3%] vs seven [7%]), and increased concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (six [3%] vs two [2%]). After 8 weeks, 17 (8%) patients in the MABp1 group and 11 (11%) in the placebo group had died, but no death was judged to be related to treatment. The incidence of serious adverse events was not significantly different in the MABp1 group and placebo groups (47 [23%] vs 33 [32%], p=0·07). The primary endpoint was a useful means of measuring clinical performance in patients. MABp1 might represent a new standard in the management of advanced colorectal cancer.

"Metronomic capecitabine as adjuvant therapy in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma have a high risk of disease relapse, despite a high proportion of patients attaining complete clinical remission after receiving standard-of-care treatment (ie, definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy). Additional adjuvant therapies are needed to further reduce the risk of recurrence and death. However, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma remains controversial, highlighting the need for more effective adjuvant treatment options. This multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 14 hospitals in China. Patients (aged 18-65 years) with histologically confirmed, high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage III-IVA, excluding T3-4N0 and T3N1 disease), no locoregional disease or distant metastasis after definitive chemoradiotherapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, sufficient haematological, renal, and hepatic function, and who had received their final radiotherapy dose 12-16 weeks before randomisation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral metronomic capecitabine (650 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area twice daily for 1 year; metronomic capecitabine group) or observation (standard therapy group). Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence (block size of four), stratified by trial centre and receipt of induction chemotherapy (yes or no). The primary endpoint was failure-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence (distant metastasis or locoregional recurrence) or death due to any cause, in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of capecitabine or who had commenced observation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,. Between Jan 25, 2017, and Oct 25, 2018, 675 patients were screened, of whom 406 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the metronomic capecitabine group (n=204) or to the standard therapy group (n=202). After a median follow-up of 38 months (IQR 33-42), there were 29 (14%) events of recurrence or death in the metronomic capecitabine group and 53 (26%) events of recurrence or death in the standard therapy group. Failure-free survival at 3 years was significantly higher in the metronomic capecitabine group (85·3% [95% CI 80·4-90·6]) than in the standard therapy group (75·7% [69·9-81·9]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0·50 (95% CI 0·32-0·79; p=0·0023). Grade 3 adverse events were reported in 35 (17%) of 201 patients in the metronomic capecitabine group and in 11 (6%) of 200 patients in the standard therapy group; hand-foot syndrome was the most common adverse event related to capecitabine (18 [9%] patients had grade 3 hand-foot syndrome). One (<1%) patient in the metronomic capecitabine group had grade 4 neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported in either group. The addition of metronomic adjuvant capecitabine to chemoradiotherapy significantly improved failure-free survival in patients with high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with a manageable safety profile. These results support a potential role for metronomic chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant cisplatin-gemcitabine versus cisplatin-fluorouracil chemotherapy for N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients with N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma have a high risk of treatment being unsuccessful despite the current practice of using a concurrent adjuvant cisplatin-fluorouracil regimen. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of concurrent adjuvant cisplatin-gemcitabine with cisplatin-fluorouracil in N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We conducted an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial at four cancer centres in China. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years with untreated, non-keratinising, stage T1-4 N2-3 M0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive concurrent cisplatin (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously) on days 1, 22, and 43 of intensity-modulated radiotherapy followed by either gemcitabine (1 g/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for 4 h on day 1) once every 3 weeks or fluorouracil (4 g/m<sup>2</sup> in continuous intravenous infusion for 96 h) and cisplatin (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously for 4 h on day 1) once every 4 weeks, for three cycles. Randomisation was done using a computer-generated random number code with a block size of six, stratified by treatment centre and nodal category. The primary endpoint was 3-year progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all patients randomly assigned to treatment). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of chemoradiotherapy. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, , and patients are currently under follow-up. From Oct 30, 2017, to July 9, 2020, 240 patients (median age 44 years [IQR 36-52]; 175 [73%] male and 65 [27%] female) were randomly assigned to the cisplatin-fluorouracil group (n=120) or cisplatin-gemcitabine group (n=120). As of data cutoff (Dec 25, 2022), median follow-up was 40 months (IQR 32-48). 3-year progression-free survival was 83·9% (95% CI 75·9-89·4; 19 disease progressions and 11 deaths) in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group and 71·5% (62·5-78·7; 34 disease progressions and seven deaths) in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group (stratified hazard ratio 0·54 [95% CI 0·32-0·93]; log rank p=0·023). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events that occurred during treatment were leukopenia (61 [52%] of 117 in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group vs 34 [29%] of 116 in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group; p=0·00039), neutropenia (37 [32%] vs 19 [16%]; p=0·010), and mucositis (27 [23%] vs 32 [28%]; p=0·43). The most common grade 3 or worse late adverse event (occurring from 3 months after completion of radiotherapy) was auditory or hearing loss (six [5%] vs ten [9%]). One (1%) patient in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group died due to treatment-related complications (septic shock caused by neutropenic infection). No patients in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group had treatment-related deaths. Our findings suggest that concurrent adjuvant cisplatin-gemcitabine could be used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients with N2-3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma, although long-term follow-up is required to confirm the optimal therapeutic ratio.

"Efficacy and safety of 3-month dosing regimen of degarelix in Japanese subjects with prostate cancer: A phase III study. Non-inferiority in the cumulative castration rate of the 3-month formulation of degarelix compared with the 3-month formulation of goserelin was evaluated in subjects with prostate cancer. A phase III, open-label, parallel-arm study was carried out. An initial dose of 240 mg degarelix or 3.6 mg goserelin was given s.c.; after day 28, a maintenance dose of 480 mg degarelix or 10.8 mg goserelin was given once every 84 days. Non-inferiority in castration rate and safety of degarelix to goserelin were evaluated. The primary end-point was the cumulative castration rate from day 28 to day 364 and the non-inferiority margin was set to be 10%. A total of 234 subjects with prostate cancer were randomized to the degarelix group (n = 117) and the goserelin group (n = 117). The cumulative castration rate was 95.1% in the degarelix group and 100.0% in the goserelin group. As there were no events in the goserelin group, an additional analysis was carried out using 95% confidence intervals of the difference in the proportion of subjects with castration. Analyses indicated the non-inferiority of the 3-month formulation of degarelix to goserelin. Degarelix showed more rapid decreases in testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and prostate-specific antigen levels compared with goserelin. The most common adverse events in the degarelix group were injection site reactions. Non-inferiority of the 3-month formulation of degarelix to goserelin was shown for testosterone suppression.

"Effectiveness of S-1-Based Chemoradiotherapy in Patients 70 Years and Older With Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Double-agent intravenous chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy is the standard of care for patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. However, patients tend to tolerate intravenous chemotherapy less well with age and comorbidities. It is essential to find a better treatment modality that improves survival outcomes without reducing the quality of life. To evaluate the effectiveness of simultaneous integrated boost radiotherapy (SIB-RT) with concurrent and consolidated oral S-1 chemotherapy for patients aged 70 years and older with inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This multicenter, phase III randomized clinical trial was conducted between March 2017 and April 2020 in 10 centers in China. Patients with inoperable, locally advanced, clinical stage II to IV ESCC were enrolled and randomized to receive SIB-RT concurrent with and followed by oral S-1 chemotherapy (CRTCT group) or SIB-RT alone (RT group). Data analysis was completed on March 22, 2022. In both groups, the planning gross tumor volume was administered with radiation dose of 59.92 Gy and the planning target volume was administered with radiation dose of 50.4 Gy, in 28 fractions each. In the CRTCT group, concurrent S-1 was administered on radiotherapy days, and consolidated S-1 was administered at 4 to 8 weeks after SIB-RT. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) of the intent-to-treat population. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity profile. A total of 330 patients (median [IQR] age, 75.5 [72-79] years; 220 [66.7%] male patients) were included, with 146 patients randomized to the RT group and 184 randomized to the CRTCT group. A total of 107 patients (73.3%) in the RT group and 121 patients (67.9%) in the CRTCT group were clinically diagnosed with stage III to IV disease. At the time of analysis of the 330 patients in the intent-to treat-population (March 22, 2022), OS was improved in the CRTCT group compared with the RT group at 1 year (72.2% vs 62.3%) and 3 years (46.2% vs 33.9%; log-rank P =.02). PFS was similarly improved in the CRTCT group compared with the RT group at 1 year (60.8% vs 49.3%) and 3 years (37.3% vs 27.9%; log-rank P =.04). There was no significant difference in the incidence of treatment-related toxic effects higher than grade 3 between the 2 groups. Grade 5 toxic effects occurred in each group, including 1 patient who experienced myelosuppression and 4 patients with pneumonitis in the RT group and 3 patients with pneumonitis and 2 patients with fever in the CRTCT group.

"Nedaplatin Plus Docetaxel Versus Cisplatin Plus Docetaxel as First-Line Chemotherapy for Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung - A Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized, Phase III Trial. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of first-line nedaplatin (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) (ND) versus cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) (CD) in patients with advanced squamous cell lung carcinoma. This open-label randomized controlled phase III trial was performed at 12 hospitals in China. Patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma were randomized to four cycles of ND or CD. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included time to progression, best overall response, and adverse events. In the intent-to-treat analysis set (ND: n = 141; CD: n = 139), median PFS was 4.63 months (95% confidence interval: 4.43-5.10) for the ND and 4.23 months (95% confidence interval: 3.37-4.53) for CD groups (p = 0.056). No significant difference in time to progression was observed between the two groups. Best overall responses and disease control rate were better with ND 51.5%, than with CD 38.1% (p = 0.033 and p = 0.0004, respectively). Grade III or IV adverse events and grade 3-4 nausea and fatigue were more frequent in the CD group compared with the ND group (all p < 0.05). There is no improvement in PFS with the nedaplatin and docetaxel combination in the intent-to-treat analysis. More hematologic toxicities were observed in the ND group (compared with CD), whereas more nonhematologic toxicities were observed in the CD group. ND could be a new treatment option for advanced or relapsed squamous cell lung cancer at ClinicalTrials.gov).",Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin compared to Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) when used to treat Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin versus Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in treating Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin and Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for managing Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin versus Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in treating Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin when compared with Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,Pick the option that best depicts how Docetaxel and Nedaplatin compares to Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in terms of treating Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Select the statement that most clearly describes the effectiveness difference between Docetaxel and Nedaplatin and Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in treating Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Which choice best compares the treatment efficacy of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin with Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,Find the option that best outlines the comparative effectiveness of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin and Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Choose the option that best portrays the efficacy of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin against Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for use in Non-small cell lung cancer squamous treatment.,Which option best explains the relative success of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin compared to Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in managing Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,Identify the choice that most accurately captures the efficacy contrast between Docetaxel and Nedaplatin and Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,What option best describes how Docetaxel and Nedaplatin fares against Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) when treating Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin and Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in managing Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,Point out the choice that best reflects the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin vis-à-vis Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for treating Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Select the option that best indicates the effectiveness of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin compared to Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in the context of Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Choose the answer that most accurately showcases the treatment success of Docetaxel and Nedaplatin versus Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for Non-small cell lung cancer squamous.,Which selection best reflects how Docetaxel and Nedaplatin performs against Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) in the treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,Identify the option that most precisely illustrates the comparison between Docetaxel and Nedaplatin and Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) for Non-small cell lung cancer squamous management.,What is the best choice that outlines the difference in efficacy between Docetaxel and Nedaplatin and Cisplatin and Docetaxel (DC) when treating Non-small cell lung cancer squamous?,1,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT02088515
"Enzalutamide in Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: An Asian Multiregional, Randomized Study. Enzalutamide significantly improved clinical outcomes compared with placebo in patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the PREVAIL study. However, few patients from Asia were enrolled. Our study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide in this disease setting in patients in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In this double-blind, phase III study, patients with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and disease progression despite ADT were randomized to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, time to first skeletal-related event (SRE), time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, PSA response ≥ 50%, best overall soft-tissue response, and safety. Pre-planned interim analysis was scheduled following approximately 175 PSA-progression events (67% of targeted total of 261 events). An additional 5-year landmark analysis of overall survival, time to antineoplastic therapy, and safety was performed. The double-blind study period was stopped after interim analysis owing to the benefit of enzalutamide over placebo. Overall, 388 patients were randomized (enzalutamide, n = 198; placebo, n = 190). Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of PSA progression vs placebo (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.27-0.52; P < 0.0001). Median time to PSA progression was 8.31 months with enzalutamide and 2.86 months with placebo. Secondary endpoints, including 5-year overall survival, were significantly improved with enzalutamide, except time to first SRE. Adverse-event incidence was similar between enzalutamide and placebo. Fatigue was the most common drug-related adverse event in both treatment groups. Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of PSA progression, improved secondary efficacy endpoints, and was well tolerated in chemotherapy-naïve Asian patients with mCRPC with disease progression despite ADT. www. gov.",Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Enzalutamide monotherapy when used to treat Prostate cancer.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Placebo versus Enzalutamide monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Placebo and Enzalutamide monotherapy for managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Placebo versus Enzalutamide monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Placebo when compared with Enzalutamide monotherapy for Prostate cancer?,Pick the option that best depicts how Placebo compares to Enzalutamide monotherapy in terms of treating Prostate cancer.,Select the statement that most clearly describes the effectiveness difference between Placebo and Enzalutamide monotherapy in treating Prostate cancer.,Which choice best compares the treatment efficacy of Placebo with Enzalutamide monotherapy for Prostate cancer?,Find the option that best outlines the comparative effectiveness of Placebo and Enzalutamide monotherapy in the treatment of Prostate cancer.,Choose the option that best portrays the efficacy of Placebo against Enzalutamide monotherapy for use in Prostate cancer treatment.,Which option best explains the relative success of Placebo compared to Enzalutamide monotherapy in managing Prostate cancer?,Identify the choice that most accurately captures the efficacy contrast between Placebo and Enzalutamide monotherapy for Prostate cancer.,What option best describes how Placebo fares against Enzalutamide monotherapy when treating Prostate cancer?,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the effectiveness of Placebo and Enzalutamide monotherapy in managing Prostate cancer?,Point out the choice that best reflects the effectiveness of Placebo vis-à-vis Enzalutamide monotherapy for treating Prostate cancer.,Select the option that best indicates the effectiveness of Placebo compared to Enzalutamide monotherapy in the context of Prostate cancer.,Choose the answer that most accurately showcases the treatment success of Placebo versus Enzalutamide monotherapy for Prostate cancer.,Which selection best reflects how Placebo performs against Enzalutamide monotherapy in the treatment of Prostate cancer?,Identify the option that most precisely illustrates the comparison between Placebo and Enzalutamide monotherapy for Prostate cancer management.,What is the best choice that outlines the difference in efficacy between Placebo and Enzalutamide monotherapy when treating Prostate cancer?,2,superior,inferior,no difference,NCT02294461
"Axitinib Versus Sorafenib in First-Line Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Overall Survival From a Randomized Phase III Trial. In a randomized phase III trial in treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), axitinib versus sorafenib yielded numerically longer progression-free survival (median, 10.1 vs. 6.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 1-sided P =.038) and significantly higher objective response rate (32% vs. 15%; 1-sided P =.0006). In this article, we report overall survival (OS) and updated safety results. Previously untreated patients with metastatic RCC (n = 288), stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS; 0 vs. 1), were randomized 2:1 to receive axitinib 5 mg twice per day (b.i.d.; n = 192) or sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. (n = 96). Median OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 21.7 months (18.0-31.7) with axitinib versus 23.3 months (18.1-33.2) with sorafenib (stratified HR, 0.995; 95% CI, 0.731-1.356; 1-sided P =.4883). Among patients with ECOG PS of 0, median OS was numerically longer with axitinib than with sorafenib (41.2 vs. 31.9 months; HR, 0.811, 1-sided P =.1748), whereas among patients with ECOG PS 1, median OS was shorter with axitinib than with sorafenib (14.2 vs. 19.8 months; HR, 1.203; 1-sided; P =.7973). Incidence and severity of common adverse events were consistent with previous reports. OS was similar between axitinib and sorafenib in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC, and no new safety signals emerged. Axitinib versus sorafenib as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma: a randomised open-label phase 3 trial. In previous clinical trials of patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma, patients treated with axitinib as second-line therapy had longer median progression-free survival than those treated with sorafenib. We therefore undertook a phase 3 trial comparing axitinib with sorafenib in patients with treatment-naive metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, patients with treatment-naive, measurable, clear-cell metastatic renal-cell carcinoma from 13 countries were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and then randomly assigned (2:1) by a centralised registration system to receive axitinib 5 mg twice daily, or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed by masked independent review committee in the intention-to-treat population. This ongoing trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,. Between June 14, 2010, and April 21, 2011, we randomly assigned 192 patients to receive axitinib, and 96 patients to receive sorafenib. The cutoff date for this analysis was July 27, 2012, when 171 (59%) of 288 patients died or had disease progression, as assessed by the independent review committee. There was no significant difference in median progression-free survival between patients treated with axitinib or sorafenib (10·1 months [95% CI 7·2-12·1] vs 6·5 months [4·7-8·3], respectively; stratified hazard ratio 0·77, 95% CI 0·56-1·05). Any-grade adverse events that were more common (≥10% difference) with axitinib than with sorafenib were diarrhoea (94 [50%] of 189 patients vs 38 [40%] of 96 patients), hypertension (92 [49%] vs 28 [29%]), weight decrease (69 [37%] vs 23 [24%]), decreased appetite (54 [29%] vs 18 [19%]), dysphonia (44 [23%] vs ten [10%]), hypothyroidism (39 [21%] vs seven [7%]), and upper abdominal pain (31 [16%] vs six [6%]); those more common with sorafenib than with axitinib included palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE; 37 [39%] of 96 patients vs 50 [26%] of 189), rash (19 [20%] vs 18 [10%]), alopecia (18 [19%] vs eight [4%]), and erythema (18 [19%] vs five [3%]). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients treated with axitinib included hypertension (26 [14%] of 189 patients), diarrhoea (17 [9%]), asthenia (16 [8%]), weight decrease (16 [8%]), and PPE (14 [7%]); common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients treated with sorafenib included PPE (15 [16%] of 96 patients), diarrhoea (five [5%]), and asthenia (five [5%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 64 (34%) of 189 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 (25%) of 96 patients receiving sorafenib. Axitinib did not significantly increase progression-free survival in patients with treatment-naive metastatic renal-cell carcinoma compared with those treated with sorafenib, but did demonstrate clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile.

"Overall survival and updated results for sunitinib compared with interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A randomized, phase III trial demonstrated superiority of sunitinib over interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) in progression-free survival (primary end point) as first-line treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Final survival analyses and updated results are reported. Seven hundred fifty treatment-naïve patients with metastatic clear cell RCC were randomly assigned to sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily on a 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off dosing schedule or to IFN-alpha 9 MU subcutaneously thrice weekly. Overall survival was compared by two-sided log-rank and Wilcoxon tests. Progression-free survival, response, and safety end points were assessed with updated follow-up. Median overall survival was greater in the sunitinib group than in the IFN-alpha group (26.4 v 21.8 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.821; 95% CI, 0.673 to 1.001; P =.051) per the primary analysis of unstratified log-rank test (P =.013 per unstratified Wilcoxon test). By stratified log-rank test, the HR was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.669 to 0.999; P =.049). Within the IFN-alpha group, 33% of patients received sunitinib, and 32% received other vascular endothelial growth factor-signaling inhibitors after discontinuation from the trial. Median progression-free survival was 11 months for sunitinib compared with 5 months for IFN-alpha (P <.001). Objective response rate was 47% for sunitinib compared with 12% for IFN-alpha (P <.001). The most commonly reported sunitinib-related grade 3 adverse events included hypertension (12%), fatigue (11%), diarrhea (9%), and hand-foot syndrome (9%). Sunitinib demonstrates longer overall survival compared with IFN-alpha plus improvement in response and progression-free survival in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic RCC. The overall survival highlights an improved prognosis in patients with RCC in the era of targeted therapy. Health-related quality of life in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib vs interferon-alpha in a phase III trial: final results and geographical analysis. In a randomised phase III trial, sunitinib significantly improved efficacy over interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) as first-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). We report the final health-related quality of life (HRQoL) results. Patients (n=750) received oral sunitinib 50 mg per day in 6-week cycles (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off treatment) or subcutaneous IFN-alpha 9 million units three times weekly. Health-related quality of life was assessed with nine end points: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and its four subscales, FACT-Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI-15) and its Disease-Related Symptoms subscale (FKSI-DRS), and EQ-5D questionnaire's EQ-5D Index and visual analogue scale. Data were analysed using mixed-effects model (MM), supplemented with pattern-mixture models (PMM), for the total sample and the US and European Union (EU) subgroups. Patients receiving sunitinib reported better scores in the primary end point, FKSI-DRS, across all patient populations (P<0.05), and in nine, five, and six end points in the total sample, in the US and EU groups respectively (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the US and EU groups for all end points with the exception of the FKSI item 'I am bothered by side effects of treatment' (P=0.02). In general, MM and PMM results were similar. Patients treated with sunitinib in this study had improved HRQoL, compared with patients treated with IFN-alpha. Treatment differences within the US cohort did not differ from those within the EU cohort. Sunitinib versus interferon alfa in metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. Since sunitinib malate has shown activity in two uncontrolled studies in patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma, a comparison of the drug with interferon alfa in a phase 3 trial is warranted. We enrolled 750 patients with previously untreated, metastatic renal-cell carcinoma in a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial to receive either repeated 6-week cycles of sunitinib (at a dose of 50 mg given orally once daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without treatment) or interferon alfa (at a dose of 9 MU given subcutaneously three times weekly). The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, patient-reported outcomes, and safety. The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sunitinib group (11 months) than in the interferon alfa group (5 months), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.54; P<0.001). Sunitinib was also associated with a higher objective response rate than was interferon alfa (31% vs. 6%, P<0.001). The proportion of patients with grade 3 or 4 treatment-related fatigue was significantly higher in the group treated with interferon alfa, whereas diarrhea was more frequent in the sunitinib group (P<0.05). Patients in the sunitinib group reported a significantly better quality of life than did patients in the interferon alfa group (P<0.001). Progression-free survival was longer and response rates were higher in patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer who received sunitinib than in those receiving interferon alfa (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, and [ClinicalTrials.gov]).",Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Sunitinib monotherapy compared to Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy when used to treat Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Select the option that most accurately reflects the effectiveness of Sunitinib monotherapy versus Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in treating Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Which option best summarizes the comparative efficacy of Sunitinib monotherapy and Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for managing Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,Identify the option that best summarizes the effectiveness of Sunitinib monotherapy versus Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in treating Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Which option most effectively illustrates the efficacy of Sunitinib monotherapy when compared with Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,Pick the option that best depicts how Sunitinib monotherapy compares to Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in terms of treating Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Select the statement that most clearly describes the effectiveness difference between Sunitinib monotherapy and Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in treating Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Which choice best compares the treatment efficacy of Sunitinib monotherapy with Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,Find the option that best outlines the comparative effectiveness of Sunitinib monotherapy and Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in the treatment of Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Choose the option that best portrays the efficacy of Sunitinib monotherapy against Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for use in Clear cell renal cell carcinoma treatment.,Which option best explains the relative success of Sunitinib monotherapy compared to Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in managing Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,Identify the choice that most accurately captures the efficacy contrast between Sunitinib monotherapy and Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,What option best describes how Sunitinib monotherapy fares against Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy when treating Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,Which option provides the clearest comparison of the effectiveness of Sunitinib monotherapy and Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in managing Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,Point out the choice that best reflects the effectiveness of Sunitinib monotherapy vis-à-vis Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for treating Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Select the option that best indicates the effectiveness of Sunitinib monotherapy compared to Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in the context of Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Choose the answer that most accurately showcases the treatment success of Sunitinib monotherapy versus Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Which selection best reflects how Sunitinib monotherapy performs against Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy in the treatment of Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,Identify the option that most precisely illustrates the comparison between Sunitinib monotherapy and Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy for Clear cell renal cell carcinoma management.,What is the best choice that outlines the difference in efficacy between Sunitinib monotherapy and Interferon alfa-2a monotherapy when treating Clear cell renal cell carcinoma?,1,superior,inferior,no difference,"NCT00098657, NCT00083889"
"Efficacy and safety of sunitinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour after failure of imatinib: a randomised controlled trial. No effective therapeutic options for patients with unresectable imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumour are available. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international trial to assess tolerability and anticancer efficacy of sunitinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour who were resistant to or intolerant of previous treatment with imatinib. Blinded sunitinib or placebo was given orally once daily at a 50-mg starting dose in 6-week cycles with 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off treatment. The primary endpoint was time to tumour progression. Intention-to-treat, modified intention-to-treat, and per-protocol analyses were done. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number. 312 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive sunitinib (n=207) or placebo (n=105); the trial was unblinded early when a planned interim analysis showed significantly longer time to tumour progression with sunitinib. Median time to tumour progression was 27.3 weeks (95% CI 16.0-32.1) in patients receiving sunitinib and 6.4 weeks (4.4-10.0) in those on placebo (hazard ratio 0.33; p<0.0001). Therapy was reasonably well tolerated; the most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, diarrhoea, skin discolouration, and nausea. We noted significant clinical benefit, including disease control and superior survival, with sunitinib compared with placebo in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour after failure and discontinuation of imatinab. Tolerability was acceptable. Complete longitudinal analyses of the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of sunitinib in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor following imatinib failure. To analyze final long-term survival and clinical outcomes from the randomized phase III study of sunitinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients after imatinib failure; to assess correlative angiogenesis biomarkers with patient outcomes. Blinded sunitinib or placebo was given daily on a 4-week-on/2-week-off treatment schedule. Placebo-assigned patients could cross over to sunitinib at disease progression/study unblinding. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using conventional statistical methods and the rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method to explore cross-over impact. Circulating levels of angiogenesis biomarkers were analyzed. In total, 243 patients were randomized to receive sunitinib and 118 to placebo, 103 of whom crossed over to open-label sunitinib. Conventional statistical analysis showed that OS converged in the sunitinib and placebo arms (median 72.7 vs. 64.9 weeks; HR, 0.876; P = 0.306) as expected, given the cross-over design. RPSFT analysis estimated median OS for placebo of 39.0 weeks (HR, 0.505, 95% CI, 0.262-1.134; P = 0.306). No new safety concerns emerged with extended sunitinib treatment. No consistent associations were found between the pharmacodynamics of angiogenesis-related plasma proteins during sunitinib treatment and clinical outcome. The cross-over design provided evidence of sunitinib clinical benefit based on prolonged time to tumor progression during the double-blind phase of this trial. As expected, following cross-over, there was no statistical difference in OS. RPSFT analysis modeled the absence of cross-over, estimating a substantial sunitinib OS benefit relative to placebo.
