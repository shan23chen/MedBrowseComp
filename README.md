## Data Extraction Methods (Simplified)

This project uses a robust, multi-step approach to extract detailed information for each clinical trial:

### 1. Author Extraction (PubMed)

- Retrieves author lists for each PubMed ID using the Bio.Entrez API.
- Handles missing names and collective authors.
- Output: JSON mapping PubMed ID to a pipe-separated author list.

### 2. NCT ID Extraction

- Scans PubMed records for NCT IDs using regex (`NCT\d{8}`).
- Searches all relevant fields (identifiers, titles, abstracts, MeSH).

### 3. Study Start Date

- Attempts to fetch the start date from multiple locations in ClinicalTrials.gov APIs.
- Falls back to pattern matching and special-case handling for older trials.

### 4. Outcome Measures

- Checks for the presence of primary and secondary outcome arrays in the trial record.
- Returns simple Yes/No indicators.

### 5. Drug Administration Routes

- Extracts drug administration routes from APIs, HTML pages, or PubMed abstracts.
- Uses pattern matching for terms like "oral", "IV", "subcutaneous", etc.

### 6. Drug Classifications

- Maps drug names and keywords to a comprehensive set of classes (e.g., PD-1 inhibitor, kinase inhibitor).
- Output: Pipe-separated list of identified drug classes.

## Data Extraction Methods

The following summarizes how HemOnc Bench extracts and enriches clinical trial data:

### 1. Author Extraction

- For each PubMed ID, fetches author information using the NCBI Entrez API.
- Builds a JSON mapping of PubMed IDs to a pipe-separated list of authors (e.g., `"John Smith|Jane Doe"`).
- Handles missing names and collective author groups robustly.

### 2. NCT ID Extraction

- Scans PubMed records for NCT IDs using the regex pattern `NCT\d{8}`.
- Searches all likely fields, including identifiers, titles, abstracts, and MeSH terms.
- Returns the first valid match found.

### 3. Study Start Date

- Attempts to extract the start date from ClinicalTrials.gov using the V2 API, which returns detailed trial records as nested JSON.
- Checks several possible JSON paths (e.g., `protocolSection/statusModule/startDateStruct/date`) because ClinicalTrials.gov has changed its schema over time and start dates may be stored in different locations for different trials.
- If none of the standard paths are found, the code searches the entire JSON for any field named "startDate" as a fallback.
- If still not found, falls back to the classic API or uses hardcoded/special-case logic for known trials.
- These JSON paths are determined by inspecting real ClinicalTrials.gov API responses. You can see them by downloading a trial's JSON from ClinicalTrials.gov and looking at its structure.
- This approach ensures compatibility across different data vintages and registry formats.

### 4. Outcome Measures

- Checks if primary and secondary outcome arrays exist in the trial data.
- Returns simple "Yes" or "No" values for each outcome type.
- Falls back to alternate APIs or special handling if needed.

### 5. Drug Administration Routes

- Extracts drug administration routes from ClinicalTrials.gov APIs or, if necessary, scrapes the ClinicalTrials.gov HTML page or searches PubMed abstracts.
- Uses pattern matching to identify common routes (e.g., oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular).
- Returns a pipe-separated list of routes.

### 6. Drug Classifications

- Maps drug names and keywords to a curated set of drug classes (e.g., PD-1 inhibitor, kinase inhibitor, immunotherapy, etc.).
- Uses both direct name matching and keyword detection for comprehensive coverage.
- Returns a pipe-separated list of all identified classes for each trial.

### ðŸ‘¥ Author Information

<details>
<summary><b>How author data is extracted</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input: PubMed ID] --> B[Use Bio.Entrez to fetch PubMed record]
    B --> C{Contains AuthorList?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Process each author]
    C -->|No| E[Return empty string]
    D --> F[Extract ForeName and LastName]
    D --> G[Or use CollectiveName]
    F --> H[Join names with pipe separator]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Return as JSON mapping PubMed ID to author list]
```

- **Primary Source**: PubMed API via Bio.Entrez
- **Format**: Pipe-separated list (e.g., `"John Smith|Jane Doe"`)
- **Resilience**: Falls back to `LastName` only if `ForeName` is missing; handles collective author names

</details>

### NCT ID Extraction

<details>
<summary><b>How NCT IDs are extracted from PubMed</b> (click to expand)</summary>

- **Process**:

  1. Fetch full XML record for a PubMed ID
  2. Apply regex pattern matching: `NCT\d{8}`
  3. Return first match if found
- **Why This Approach?**
  NCT IDs can appear in various locations in PubMed records:

  - Secondary identifier fields
  - Article titles
  - Abstracts
  - MeSH terms

  Regex pattern matching provides the most comprehensive way to find these IDs regardless of their location.

<summary><b>Multi-layered extraction of start dates</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input: NCT ID] --> B[Try ClinicalTrials.gov V2 API]
    B --> C{Found start date?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Return start date]
    C -->|No| E[Check multiple JSON locations]
    E --> F{Found start date?}
    F -->|Yes| D
    F -->|No| G[Try classic ClinicalTrials.gov API]
    G --> H{Found start date?}
    H -->|Yes| D
    H -->|No| I[Special case handling]
    I -->|Known trial| J[Use hardcoded value]
    I -->|Unknown trial| K[Return empty string]
    J --> D
```

- **Primary Method**: ClinicalTrials.gov V2 API
- **JSON Locations Checked**:

  1. `protocolSection/statusModule/startDateStruct/date`
  2. `protocolSection/statusModule/startDate`
  3. `protocolSection/designModule/studyStartDateStruct/date`
  4. `protocolSection/designModule/studyStartDate`
  5. `derivedSection/startDateStruct/date`
  6. `derivedSection/startDate`
  7. Pattern matching for any `"startDate"` field
- **Why So Complex?**
  The ClinicalTrials.gov data structure has evolved over time, with older trials having different formats. This comprehensive approach ensures maximum data recovery across all trial vintages.

</details>

### Primary & Secondary Outcome Measures

<details>
<summary><b>Outcome measure detection strategy</b> (click to expand)</summary>

- **Primary Method**: Check for array existence

  - Primary outcomes: `protocolSection/outcomesModule/primaryOutcomes`
  - Secondary outcomes: `protocolSection/outcomesModule/secondaryOutcomes`
- **Output**: Simple "Yes" or "No"
- **Fallback Chain**:

  1. V2 API â†’ 2. Classic API â†’ 3. Special case handling
- **Practical Impact**:
  Having this information helps researchers quickly identify trials with well-defined outcome measurements, an important factor in assessing study quality.

    K -->|Unknown trial| M["Return 'Unknown'"]
    L --> N["Format as pipe-separated list"]
    D --> N
    N --> O["Return formatted routes"]
```

- **Pattern Matching**: Text analysis for terms like:

  - "oral"
  - "intravenous"/"i.v."
  - "subcutaneous"/"s.c."
  - "intramuscular"/"i.m."
  - And many more
- **Why This Matters**:
  Administration route affects drug bioavailability, patient convenience, and compliance. This information helps researchers understand critical aspects of treatment protocols.
