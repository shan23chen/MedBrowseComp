The latest reference on this page is from 2013, which is well after the Jones et al. 2005 publication.

Based on all the evidence I've found:

1. The 2000 review article by Sparano JA stated that ""Further research is necessary in order to identify the efficacy of docetaxel relative to paclitaxel..."" suggesting that as of April 2000, there was a need for direct comparison studies of docetaxel versus paclitaxel, and such studies may not have been completed or may have just begun.

2. The 2003 review article does not mention any ongoing or completed direct comparison trials of docetaxel versus paclitaxel monotherapy for breast cancer.

3. The Jones et al. 2005 study was published in August 2005, which means the clinical trial must have started and finished before that date.

4. The Google AI overview suggested that this trial ""likely began between 1999 and 2002,"" specifically mentioning that one study included patients who received their first dose of either drug between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2002.

5. The AI overview also mentioned that another trial, published in 2008, enrolled patients between October 1999 and January 2002.

Based on these findings, and considering that most clinical trials take several years to complete and publish, it's most likely that the Jones et al. 2005 clinical trial comparing docetaxel monotherapy to paclitaxel monotherapy for breast cancer started between 1999 and 2002, with the most likely start date being sometime in 1999.
