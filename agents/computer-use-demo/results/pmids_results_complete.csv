Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>","Based on my analysis of both trials, I need to determine which paper better describes the efficacy comparison between Sunitinib and Everolimus in non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

Let me highlight the key findings from each trial:

**ESPN Trial (PMID: 26626617)**:
- First head-to-head comparison of everolimus and sunitinib in patients with metastatic non-ccRCC
- Median progression-free survival (mPFS) in first-line: 6.1 months with sunitinib vs 4.1 months with everolimus (p=0.6)
- Median overall survival (mOS): 16.2 months vs 14.9 months with sunitinib and everolimus, respectively (p=0.18)
- Response rates: Sunitinib 9%, Everolimus 2.8% in first-line therapy
- Conclusion: ""Everolimus was not superior to sunitinib. Both agents demonstrated modest efficacy, underscoring the need for better therapies in non-ccRCC.""

**ASPEN Trial (PMID: 26794930)**:
- Larger trial (108 patients) specifically comparing the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the VEGF receptor inhibitor sunitinib
- Sunitinib significantly increased progression-free survival compared with everolimus (8.3 months vs 5.6 months)
- More detailed breakdown of adverse events and toxicity profiles
- Stronger statistical significance in PFS comparison (p=0.16 with 80% CI)
- Conclusion: ""In patients with metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, sunitinib improved progression-free survival compared with everolimus.""

The ASPEN trial (PMID: 26794930) appears to be the more definitive study for several reasons:
1. Larger sample size (108 vs 68 patients)
2. Completed as planned (ESPN was terminated early)
3. More statistically significant results regarding progression-free survival
4. Published in Lancet Oncology, a high-impact oncology journal
5. More comprehensive analysis of subtypes and risk groups
6. Clearer conclusion about the superiority of Sunitinib over Everolimus

Therefore, the ASPEN trial with PMID 26794930 provides the best description of the efficacy of Sunitinib monotherapy compared to Everolimus monotherapy when used to treat non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

Now I need to analyze both these major studies to determine which one best describes the efficacy of vemurafenib monotherapy compared to placebo for treating melanoma:

1. BRIM-3 (PMID: 28961848): Compared vemurafenib to dacarbazine (standard treatment) in metastatic melanoma. This was the pivotal trial that established vemurafenib's efficacy for treatment of metastatic melanoma.

2. BRIM-8 (PMID: 29477665): Compared vemurafenib to placebo as adjuvant therapy in resected melanoma (meaning after surgical removal of the melanoma).

The question asks specifically for the paper that best describes the efficacy of vemurafenib monotherapy compared to placebo in treating melanoma. 

The BRIM-8 trial (PMID: 29477665) is truly placebo-controlled, but it's for adjuvant therapy after surgery, not for treating active melanoma.

The BRIM-3 trial (PMID: 28961848) compared vemurafenib to dacarbazine (not placebo), but it was specifically for treating active metastatic melanoma.

Given the specific wording of the query asking for vemurafenib monotherapy compared to placebo when used to ""treat melanoma"", the BRIM-8 trial (PMID: 29477665) is the closest match since it is truly placebo-controlled, even though it's in the adjuvant setting.

The study compared testosterone suppression plus enzalutamide versus testosterone suppression plus standard antiandrogen therapy (including docetaxel use). The abstract specifically mentions that ""Overall survival benefits with enzalutamide were consistent across predefined prognostic subgroups and planned use of concurrent docetaxel.""

Let me check the PubMed ID again and provide the answer.

Based on my research, the paper that best describes the efficacy of Docetaxel, Enzalutamide, Prednisolone compared to Docetaxel and Prednisolone in prostate cancer treatment is the ENZAMET trial:

pmid36990608

This paper shows that the addition of enzalutamide to standard therapy (which included docetaxel for some patients) showed sustained improvement in overall survival for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The study included subgroup analyses specifically examining the effects in patients who received concurrent docetaxel treatment."
"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of ADT compared to ADT, Abiraterone, Apalutamide when used to treat Prostate cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>","Now I can confirm that this paper is highly relevant to the request. The study specifically compared different systemic therapy options for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, including:

1. ADT alone
2. Doublet therapy with ARAT (which includes Abiraterone and Apalutamide) + ADT
3. Triplet therapy with ARAT + docetaxel + ADT

The paper concludes that triplet therapy ranked first in systematic treatment, followed by doublet therapy (ARAT + ADT), and lastly docetaxel + ADT.

I can see that this paper specifically mentions Abiraterone and Apalutamide in the keywords section, confirming it discusses these specific drugs along with ADT.

Based on my search, this paper appears to be the most relevant for comparing the efficacy of ADT alone versus ADT with Abiraterone and Apalutamide in treating prostate cancer. The PubMed ID is clearly shown as 36058809.

Therefore, the answer to the request is:

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>","I can now see both papers in detail:

1. First paper (PMID: 25470694):
   - Solomon BJ, et al. (2014)

   - This is a phase 3 trial comparing crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) with standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin) as first-line treatment for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.
   - Results showed crizotinib was superior with significantly longer progression-free survival (10.9 vs 7.0 months).
   - The study specifically compared crizotinib monotherapy to pemetrexed-plus-platinum chemotherapy, which includes carboplatin.
   - The conclusion explicitly states: ""Crizotinib was superior to standard first-line pemetrexed-plus-platinum chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.""

2. Second paper (PMID: 26816533):
   - Zhang Q, et al. (2016)

   - This study compared crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) with standard chemotherapy (including pemetrexed with carboplatin) in advanced ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma.
   - It specifically mentions that in the chemotherapy arm, patients received pemetrexed and carboplatin.

Based on the review of both papers, PMID: 25470694 (Solomon et al.) appears to be the most comprehensive and directly relevant paper comparing crizotinib monotherapy to carboplatin and pemetrexed for treating ALK-positive NSCLC. This was a phase 3 clinical trial that specifically compared crizotinib to a combination of pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin. The paper's conclusion explicitly states that crizotinib was superior to pemetrexed-plus-platinum chemotherapy, which includes the carboplatin and pemetrexed combination we're looking for.
