Output it in the format NCT<Number>","Perfect! I can now see both studies:

1. NCT00974311: ""Safety and Efficacy Study of MDV3100 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Been Previously Treated With Docetaxel-based Chemotherapy"" - This is the AFFIRM trial.

2. NCT01212991: ""A Safety and Efficacy Study of Oral MDV3100 in Chemotherapy-Naive Patients With Progressive Metastatic Prostate Cancer"" - This is the PREVAIL trial.

Both of these trials evaluated enzalutamide (MDV3100) monotherapy compared to placebo in patients with prostate cancer, but in different patient populations:

1. AFFIRM (NCT00974311) studied patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously received docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

2. PREVAIL (NCT01212991) studied chemotherapy-naive patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer.

Both trials are landmark studies that demonstrate the efficacy of enzalutamide monotherapy compared to placebo in prostate cancer. However, the AFFIRM trial (NCT00974311) was the first phase 3 trial to establish the efficacy of enzalutamide monotherapy compared to placebo in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, and it led to the initial FDA approval of enzalutamide for this indication.

4. NCT03701321: ""Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone With or Without Venetoclax"" - This study also includes Daratumumab, which makes it less relevant to our specific query.

Based on my review of all the clinical trials in the search results, NCT02755597 is the most relevant clinical trial ID that best describes the efficacy of Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) compared to Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) and Venetoclax when used to treat Multiple myeloma.

The clinical trial ID that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Vemurafenib monotherapy when used to treat Melanoma is:

NCT01667419

This is the BRIM8 trial, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that specifically compared vemurafenib monotherapy to placebo in patients with resected BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.

The trial evaluated disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, and the findings showed that in cohort 2 (patients with stage IIIC disease), median disease-free survival was 23.1 months in the vemurafenib group versus 15.4 months in the placebo group. In cohort 1 (patients with stage IIC-IIIA-IIIB disease), median disease-free survival was not reached in the vemurafenib group versus 36.9 months in the placebo group.

This trial directly compared the efficacy of vemurafenib monotherapy to placebo in the treatment of melanoma, making it the most relevant clinical trial ID for the requested information."
"Find/search the clinical trial id that best describes the efficacy of ATRA, Mercaptopurine, Methotrexate compared to ATRA monotherapy when used to treat Acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Output it in the format NCT<Number>","I can see Figure 3 showing:
- Figure 3A: Relapse according to maintenance CT
- Figure 3B: Relapse according to maintenance ATRA
- Figure 3C: Relapse according to maintenance treatment group

The figure clearly shows that the CT (continuous chemotherapy with mercaptopurine and methotrexate) significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared to ATRA alone.

I can also see a list of the collaborating centers and investigators who participated in this European APL Group study.

I'm now in the References section of the paper, and I do not see any clinical trial registration information or NCT number mentioned. This is likely because this trial (APL93) was conducted between April 1, 1993 and December 31, 1996, which was before the requirement for trial registration with clinicaltrials.gov became standardized.

After searching through all available sources including the original APL93 trial publication and more recent review articles, I cannot find any NCT number associated with this trial. This is likely because the trial was conducted in the 1990s, before the requirement for clinical trial registration became standard.

Based on all the evidence we've examined:

1. The European APL Group's APL93 trial is the clinical trial that best describes the efficacy of ATRA, Mercaptopurine, Methotrexate compared to ATRA monotherapy when used to treat Acute promyelocytic leukemia.

2. The Italian GIMEMA group's AIDA 0493 protocol also compared similar maintenance regimens, including ATRA monotherapy versus mercaptopurine and methotrexate.

3. I cannot find an NCT number for either of these trials, most likely because they were conducted in the 1990s, before clinical trial registration with clinicaltrials.gov became standard practice.

4. The closest recent trial with an NCT number that includes ATRA, Mercaptopurine, and Methotrexate for APL treatment is NCT02688140, but this trial does not specifically compare ATRA + Mercaptopurine + Methotrexate versus ATRA monotherapy as the primary objective.

Therefore, I cannot provide an NCT number for the clinical trial that best describes the efficacy of ATRA, Mercaptopurine, Methotrexate compared to ATRA monotherapy for APL, as it appears this trial (APL93 by the European APL Group) predates the NCT numbering system."

This abstract from the clinical trial NCT01311687 (MM-003) clearly states that ""Pomalidomide alone has shown limited efficacy in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, but synergistic effects have been noted when combined with dexamethasone."" This directly addresses the comparison of Pomalidomide monotherapy versus Pomalidomide plus Dexamethasone (Pd).

While this trial (NCT01311687) itself compared Pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone with high-dose dexamethasone alone (not directly Pomalidomide monotherapy), it references previous findings about the difference in efficacy between Pomalidomide monotherapy and Pomalidomide plus Dexamethasone.

This trial does include a comparison between ibrutinib monotherapy and a rituximab-containing regimen (bendamustine plus rituximab), which is close to what we're looking for. However, it doesn't directly compare rituximab monotherapy to ibrutinib monotherapy, as the rituximab is used in combination with bendamustine.

Find/search the clinical trial id that best describes the efficacy of AC-TH (Docetaxel) compared to AC-D when used to treat Breast cancer (Node Positive). Output it in the format NCT<Number>,"Based on my research, the clinical trial that best describes the efficacy of AC-TH (Docetaxel) compared to AC-D when used to treat node-positive breast cancer appears to be NSABP B-31. However, I've also found that this trial is often paired with the N9831 trial (NCT00005970) in joint analyses.

From the information available, it appears that NSABP B-31 compares AC followed by paclitaxel (AC-T) with AC followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-TH) in node-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer. However, I'm not finding a direct comparison of AC-TH (with docetaxel) to AC-D as specified in the original request.

The most relevant NCT number I've found for the comparison of AC+docetaxel vs. AC+docetaxel+trastuzumab in node-positive breast cancer is:
