"Find/search the second author of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Lenalidomide monotherapy when used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome.
Output it in the format SA<Second Author>","Based on my analysis of both papers:

1. The Fenaux paper (2011) is a phase 3 randomized controlled trial specifically comparing lenalidomide to placebo in del5q MDS patients. This paper has 607 citations, indicating its significant impact in the field. It clearly demonstrates the efficacy of lenalidomide compared to placebo, showing 56.1% and 42.6% vs 5.9% RBC-transfusion independence with lenalidomide doses versus placebo.

2. The Santini paper (2016) is also a phase 3 randomized controlled trial but focuses on non-del5q MDS patients. It has fewer citations (258-259) compared to the Fenaux paper.

Both papers are highly relevant, but the Fenaux paper appears to be the more influential and widely cited study on lenalidomide versus placebo in MDS. It was also published earlier (2011 vs 2016) and has been cited more than twice as often. The Fenaux paper clearly demonstrates the efficacy of lenalidomide compared to placebo in MDS patients with del5q.

Therefore, I determine that the Fenaux paper ""A randomized phase 3 study of lenalidomide versus placebo in RBC transfusion-dependent patients with Low-/Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with del5q"" best describes the efficacy of placebo compared to lenalidomide monotherapy when used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome.

The most significant paper that best describes the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 and Cetuximab compared to mFOLFOX6 alone in treating colon cancer appears to be the pooled analysis of the PETACC8 and N0147 trials, which involves a very large number of patients (N = 5,577) in two phase III trials.
