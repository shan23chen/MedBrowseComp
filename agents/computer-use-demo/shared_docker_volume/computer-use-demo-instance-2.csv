Run 'python --version' in the terminal and explain what this command does.,"## Explanation of the `python --version` command

I've successfully run the command in the terminal, and here's what it does:

The command `python --version` is used to display the version of Python that is installed on your system. It consists of two parts:

1. `python`: This is the command to invoke the Python interpreter
2. `--version`: This is a flag (or option) that tells Python to display its version information instead of entering the interactive mode

### Results:
As shown in the terminal, both `python --version` and `python3 --version` returned the same output:
```
Python 3.11.6
```

This indicates that Python 3.11.6 is installed on this system, and both the `python` and `python3` commands point to the same Python installation.

### Why this command is useful:
- It helps verify that Python is properly installed on your system
- It confirms which version of Python you're using, which is important because code written for different Python versions might have compatibility issues
- It's a quick way to check if you have the required version for a particular project or library
- In some systems, `python` might point to Python 2.x while `python3` points to Python 3.x, so checking both can be informative

This is a basic but essential command that's often used before starting Python development work or when troubleshooting Python-related issues."
