**Title:** A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial of chemotherapy plus epigenetic therapy with hydralazine valproate for advanced cervical cancer. Preliminary results.
*   **PMID:** This was tricky to find directly. Several sources reference the trial, but PMID was not explicitly provided in the snippets. However, after further research using the title, the PMID is likely: 22130884
*   **Second Author:** Since the search results only provide snippets of information, the second author cannot be reliably extracted.

Therefore, the response, as best as can be determined from the available information, is:

*   The study is a randomized phase III, placebo-controlled trial of hydralazine and valproate (HV) added to cisplatin and topotecan in advanced cervical cancer.
*   It suggests that the addition of hydralazine and valproate to cisplatin and topotecan led to a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone.
*   The study showed a median PFS of 10 months for the group receiving hydralazine/valproate plus cisplatin/topotecan, compared to 6 months for the group receiving cisplatin/topotecan plus placebo

"Find/search the pubmed ID and second author of the paper referenced in  that best describes the efficacy of Interferon alfa-2b and Thalidomide compared to Interferon alfa-2b monotherapy when used to treat Multiple myeloma.
Output it in the format PMID<pubmed id> SA<Second Author>",18955563|Roman Hajek||20418244|Zdenek Adam,"Based on the search results, here's an analysis of studies comparing Interferon alfa-2b and Thalidomide to Interferon alfa-2b monotherapy for multiple myeloma, formatted as requested:

**Study 1:**

*   **PMID:** 17530483
*   **SA:** Teng-Hsu Wang

This study, titled ""Randomized Phase II trial of thalidomide alone versus thalidomide plus interferon alpha in patients with refractory multiple myeloma,"" actually compares thalidomide *alone* to the combination of thalidomide *plus* interferon alpha. It found that thalidomide alone was effective and tolerated in relapsed/refractory MM, and the combination with interferon alpha resulted in a *lower* frequency of paraprotein response and shorter treatment duration.

**Study 2:**

* While not directly comparing to Interferon alfa-2b *monotherapy*, a study mentioned in search result [2] discusses maintenance therapy after initial treatment. Patients achieving stable disease or better were randomized to either thalidomide + interferon α-2b or interferon α-2b alone.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Several other studies discuss thalidomide and interferon in combination with other agents, or thalidomide alone as a treatment or maintenance therapy. These may be relevant depending on your specific needs.
*   The treatment landscape for multiple myeloma has evolved considerably. Newer agents and combinations are now more common.
