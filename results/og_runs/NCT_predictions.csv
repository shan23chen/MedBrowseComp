Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of ATG (Rabbit) monotherapy compared to Observation when used to treat Graft versus host disease.,NCT00678275,"Based on the information I found, it's challenging to provide a single, definitive clinical trial ID (NCT number) that perfectly answers your question about the efficacy of ATG (Rabbit) monotherapy *compared to Observation* in treating Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). Here's why, and what the research indicates:

*   **ATG is rarely used as monotherapy and typically compared to other active treatments:** Most studies investigate ATG in combination with other immunosuppressants (like cyclosporine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, etc.) for *prophylaxis* (prevention) of GvHD, rather than as a treatment on its own compared to doing nothing (""observation"").
*   **Focus on Prevention, Not Treatment:** The majority of research focuses on preventing GvHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) rather than treating established GvHD with ATG monotherapy versus observation.
*   **Different ATG formulations**: There are different rabbit ATG formulations (Thymoglobulin vs. Grafalon) which may have slightly different effects.

**What the Research Suggests About ATG (Rabbit) in GvHD:**

*   **Reduced GvHD Incidence:** Several studies and meta-analyses suggest that adding rabbit ATG to standard immunosuppressive regimens (like cyclosporine and methotrexate) reduces the incidence and severity of both acute and chronic GvHD.
*   **No Survival Benefit:** While ATG can reduce GvHD, this does not always translate to improved overall survival. Some studies have even shown a potential for increased infection-related mortality or non-relapse mortality with higher ATG doses.
*   **Dose Matters:** Some research indicates that lower doses of ATG may be as effective as higher doses in preventing GvHD, with a potentially better safety profile (less infection risk).

While a direct comparison of ATG monotherapy *versus observation* for *treating* established GvHD is lacking, here's a general idea of the trend that can be said about it's efficacy based on the snippets:

*   **ATG is effective in reducing the risk of GvHD:** Multiple studies have demonstrated that ATG, particularly rabbit ATG, is effective in preventing both acute and chronic GvHD when used as part of a conditioning regimen in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
*   **Combination Therapies are Common:** ATG is typically used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents like cyclosporine, methotrexate, or tacrolimus to enhance its efficacy in GvHD prevention.
*   **Dosage Considerations:** While ATG is effective, determining the optimal dosage is crucial. Some studies suggest that lower doses of ATG may be as effective as higher doses in preventing GvHD, with a potentially better safety profile.

It is important to note that I couldn't find a specific clinical trial with an NCT ID that compares ATG monotherapy to observation, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional or refer to specialized databases for comprehensive information.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Paclitaxel monotherapy compared to Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab when used to treat Breast cancer (Metastatic).,NCT00028990,"Based on the search results, here's what can be said about the efficacy of Paclitaxel monotherapy compared to Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in treating metastatic breast cancer:

*   **Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab Combination Shows Improved Progression-Free Survival:** Multiple studies, including a phase 3 trial, have shown that adding bevacizumab to paclitaxel significantly prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) compared to paclitaxel alone. For example, one study reported a median PFS of 11.8 months for the combination versus 5.9 months for paclitaxel alone. In another study focusing on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, the combination resulted in a PFS of 8.8 months compared to 4.6 months with paclitaxel alone.

*   **Overall Survival (OS) Benefit is Less Clear:** While the combination improves PFS, studies haven't consistently shown a significant improvement in overall survival (OS). Some studies have shown similar OS rates between the two groups. However, a real-world study using the ESME database suggested that the combination therapy might improve OS compared to paclitaxel monotherapy.

*   **Increased Response Rate:** The combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab has also been shown to increase the objective response rate (ORR) compared to paclitaxel alone.

*   **Increased Side Effects:** It's important to note that the paclitaxel and bevacizumab combination is associated with a higher incidence of certain side effects, such as hypertension, proteinuria, headache, cerebrovascular ischemia, and infection.

Regarding a specific clinical trial ID, several are mentioned in the search results in relation to this topic:

**General Findings:**

*   Several studies suggest that aspirin and rivaroxaban have comparable efficacy in preventing VTE in certain situations, particularly after total hip or knee arthroplasty.
*   However, some research indicates rivaroxaban may be more effective than aspirin for long-term prevention of recurrent VTE.
*   Dual pathway inhibition (rivaroxaban plus aspirin) may reduce the risk of VTE compared to aspirin alone in patients with atherosclerosis.

**Specific Studies and Trials:**

*   **COMPASS Trial:** Data from this trial indicate that dual pathway inhibition (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg daily) reduced the risk of incident VTE compared to aspirin monotherapy in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Rivaroxaban monotherapy did not significantly reduce VTE events compared to aspirin monotherapy in this trial.
*   **EPCAT II Trial:** This trial found no significant difference in VTE rates between aspirin and rivaroxaban groups at 90 days post-total hip or knee arthroplasty.
*   A study comparing aspirin with rivaroxaban and subcutaneous LMWH, found a higher DVT rate in patients receiving aspirin than that in rivaroxaban
*   **MAYO Clinic PEPPER Study:** a randomized study comparing enteric coated aspirin, low intensity warfarin, and rivaroxaban after hip and knee replacement, with **NCT02810704**

**Efficacy Summary:**

*   **Improved Progression-Free Survival (PFS):** Studies like GOG-0218 and ICON-7 demonstrated that adding bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel improved PFS in women with advanced ovarian cancer. For example, GOG-0218 showed a median PFS of 14.1 months in the group receiving bevacizumab throughout the treatment compared to 10.3 months in the control group (carboplatin and paclitaxel alone).
*   **Overall Survival (OS):** While bevacizumab improved PFS, some trials, including the final OS analysis of GOG-0218, did not demonstrate a significant difference in overall survival (OS) among the groups. However, in high-risk patients in the ICON-7 study, OS was better in the bevacizumab group.
*   **Extended Bevacizumab Duration:** A study with the identifier NCT01462890 investigated whether extending bevacizumab treatment duration improved outcomes. The conclusion was that longer treatment duration with bevacizumab (up to 30 months) did *not* improve PFS or OS compared to the standard 15-month duration.

**Relevant Clinical Trial IDs (NCT Numbers):**

*   **NCT01462890:** This trial compared standard versus extended duration of bevacizumab treatment.
*   **NCT03602859:** This trial studies the effects of dostarlimab and niraparib in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab

**Efficacy of EC-D + Bevacizumab vs. EC-D:**

*   **pCR Rates:** Some studies, like GeparQuinto, initially showed that adding bevacizumab to anthracycline/taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (like EC-D) increased pathological complete response (pCR) rates, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). A subsequent analysis reported at ASCO 2011 indicated higher pCR rates in breast and lymph nodes with EC -> T plus bevacizumab compared to EC -> D alone (36.4% vs. 28%).
*   **Long-Term Outcomes:** However, longer-term follow-up data from studies like GeparQuinto didn't support the sustained benefit of bevacizumab. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were not significantly different between patients who received bevacizumab and those who received chemotherapy alone. Specifically, in the GeparQuinto study, with a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the outcome was not different for patients receiving bevacizumab (HR 1.03; P = 0.784 for DFS and HR 0.974; P = 0.842 for OS) compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Radiation therapy compared to Nivolumab and RT when used to treat Non-small cell lung cancer.,NCT03110978,"Based on the search results, several clinical trials explore the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) compared to nivolumab and RT in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here's a summary of relevant findings and corresponding clinical trial IDs:

*   **NCT03391869:** This phase III trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab work with or without local consolidation therapy (surgery or radiation therapy) in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. It aims to determine if the combination improves survival outcomes compared to nivolumab and ipilimumab alone. The study description indicates that it is unknown whether adding local consolidation therapy to nivolumab and ipilimumab is more effective.
*   **NCT04013542:** This phase I trial studies the side effects and efficacy of ipilimumab and nivolumab in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer. The trial seeks to compare this combination to standard chemotherapy plus radiation therapy.
*   **NCT02768558:** This trial assesses nivolumab as consolidation therapy for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. The trial is ongoing, and no results have been reported yet.
*   **NCT02595944:** This phase III trial studies how well nivolumab after surgery and chemotherapy work in treating patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

Several studies suggest that combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab can improve outcomes compared to immunotherapy alone:

*   A meta-analysis found that adding RT to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic NSCLC. The study also indicated that RT could improve local control of lesions outside the irradiation field.
*   One study retrospectively analyzed patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and found that those who received radiotherapy within 60 days of immunotherapy with nivolumab had longer median OS and PFS than those who received immunotherapy more than 60 days after radiotherapy.
*   Another study including patients with stage III and IV NSCLC who received sintilimab with or without radiotherapy showed that PFS and OS were significantly longer in the immune-combined radiotherapy group compared to the immunotherapy alone group.
*   A phase I study found that hypofractionated radiotherapy could increase the responsivity to nivolumab with acceptable toxicity and encouraging remission rates.

Therefore, based on the information available, a combination of radiation therapy and Nivolumab appears to be more efficient in treating Non-small cell lung cancer.

*   **Ipilimumab Alone vs. gp100 Alone:** Ipilimumab monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to the gp100 vaccine alone. In previously treated patients, ipilimumab alone reduced the risk of death by 34% compared to the gp100 vaccine alone. The median overall survival was 10.1 months with ipilimumab and 6.4 months with gp100 alone.

*   **Ipilimumab + gp100 vs. gp100 Alone:** The combination of ipilimumab and gp100 also resulted in a significant improvement in OS compared to gp100 alone. The median overall survival was 10.0 months with the combination, versus 6.4 months with gp100 alone.

*   **Ipilimumab Alone vs. Ipilimumab + gp100:** There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the ipilimumab alone group and the ipilimumab + gp100 group. This suggests that adding the gp100 vaccine to ipilimumab did not provide additional benefit.

In conclusion, ipilimumab, whether used alone or in combination with the gp100 vaccine, was more effective than the gp100 vaccine alone in improving overall survival for patients with previously treated, advanced melanoma. However, the addition of the gp100 vaccine to ipilimumab did not significantly improve outcomes compared to ipilimumab monotherapy.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (CP) compared to Durvalumab monotherapy when used to treat Non-small cell lung cancer.,NCT02453282,"Based on the search results, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (CP) is often used as the chemotherapy backbone in combination with Durvalumab for treating Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). When comparing CP to Durvalumab monotherapy, studies like the PACIFIC trial (though it uses chemoradiotherapy followed by Durvalumab) demonstrate that Durvalumab, especially after chemoradiation, improves overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo. Direct comparisons of CP alone versus Durvalumab alone are less common, as Durvalumab is frequently studied in combination with chemotherapy or after chemoradiation.

Several clinical trials are investigating Durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy regimens including Carboplatin and Paclitaxel:

*   **NCT03800134:** A study of neoadjuvant/adjuvant Durvalumab for resectable NSCLC.
*   **NCT05358691:** A phase I trial studying AN0025 with Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, Durvalumab, and radiation for stage III NSCLC.
*   **NCT03916419:** A phase II trial of MR-guided hypofractionated adaptive radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (including carboplatin and paclitaxel) and consolidation Durvalumab for inoperable stage IIB, IIIA, and select IIIB and IIIC NSCLC.

Based on the available information, it's difficult to provide a single clinical trial ID that *directly* compares CP alone to Durvalumab monotherapy. However, trials investigating Durvalumab in combination with CP, or following CP-based chemoradiation, suggest that Durvalumab improves outcomes in NSCLC.

*   **ABVD alone vs. ABVD + Radiation:** Several studies suggest that ABVD alone can lead to a higher overall survival rate compared to treatment that includes subtotal nodal radiation therapy, primarily due to a lower rate of death from other causes. However, ABVD alone may result in a lower rate of freedom from disease progression.
*   **Early-stage favorable Hodgkin Lymphoma:** The GHSG (German Hodgkin Study Group) trials have shown that for early-stage favorable HL, 2 cycles of ABVD followed by involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT) with 20 Gy is an effective primary treatment.
*   **Advanced Stages:** In advanced stages, consolidation RT after systemic therapy remains controversial. Some studies suggest that in PET-negative patients after chemotherapy, radiation may not be necessary.

Here are a few relevant clinical trial IDs related to these findings:

*   **NCT00002561:** This trial compared ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Dexamethasone monotherapy compared to Pd when used to treat Multiple myeloma (Relapsed or Refractory).,NCT01311687,"Based on the information available from the searches, Dexamethasone monotherapy is generally less effective compared to Pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Pd) in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

In a phase III MM-003 trial, Pd showed superior efficacy compared to dexamethasone alone, with higher ORR (31% vs. 10%), longer PFS (4.0 vs. 1.9 months), and improved OS (12.7 vs. 8.1 months).

While several clinical trials explore dexamethasone in combination with other agents for RRMM, including NCT02773030, which studies CC-220 in combination with dexamethasone, dexamethasone monotherapy is not generally favored due to its lower efficacy compared to combination regimens like Pd.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Pacritinib monotherapy compared to Hydroxyurea monotherapy when used to treat Myelofibrosis.,NCT01773187,"Based on the information available, here's the clinical trial ID and a summary of the efficacy of Pacritinib compared to Hydroxyurea in treating Myelofibrosis:

*   **Clinical Trial ID:** NCT02055781, NCT03165734.

It's challenging to provide a definitive statement about Pacritinib's efficacy compared *specifically* to Hydroxyurea based solely on the search results. Here's why and what the trials suggest:

*   **""Best Available Therapy"" (BAT) Comparisons:** Many trials compare Pacritinib to ""Best Available Therapy"" (BAT). BAT could include Hydroxyurea, but also other treatments or even just symptom management. So, it's not a direct head-to-head comparison in those cases.
*   **Focus on Thrombocytopenia:** Pacritinib has shown promise, particularly in myelofibrosis patients with low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). Some trials specifically enroll this population.
*  **Efficacy Highlights:**
    *   Pacritinib has demonstrated significant and durable reduction in splenomegaly and improved symptom control compared to BAT in myelofibrosis patients, including those with severe thrombocytopenia.
    *   In PERSIST-1, which compared Pacritinib to BAT (excluding Ruxolitinib), Pacritinib showed better spleen and symptom burden reduction regardless of allele burden.
    *   PERSIST-2 compared Pacritinib to BAT, *including* Ruxolitinib, in patients with lower platelet counts.
*   **PACIFICA Trial:** The PACIFICA trial (NCT03165734) compares Pacritinib to ""Physician's Choice,"" which *could* include Hydroxyurea (along with low-dose Ruxolitinib, Danazol, or corticosteroids) in patients with advanced Myelofibrosis and severe thrombocytopenia.

Here's a summary of the findings:

*   **Efficacy in Thrombocytopenia:** Pacritinib has demonstrated superiority in patients with myelofibrosis and low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). This is because standard JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib can worsen thrombocytopenia, often requiring dose reductions that compromise efficacy.

*   **Spleen Volume Reduction and Symptom Improvement:** Studies like PERSIST-2 showed that pacritinib achieved higher rates of spleen volume reduction (SVR) and total symptom score (TSS) response compared to best available therapy (BAT), which often included ruxolitinib.

*   **Dose Intensity:** Patients treated with pacritinib were more likely to maintain full dose intensity compared to those on ruxolitinib, particularly in the presence of cytopenias.

*   **Overall Survival:** Some data suggests a potential overall survival benefit with pacritinib compared to ruxolitinib in patients with cytopenic myelofibrosis.

**Summary:**

*   **Postmenopausal Women:** Several studies, including the TEAM trial, suggest that exemestane monotherapy and sequential treatment with tamoxifen followed by exemestane are both reasonable options for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. Some studies suggest Aromatase inhibitors improved disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen when given as an initial adjuvant treatment or after 2-3 years of tamoxifen to postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.
*   **Metastatic Breast Cancer:** One phase III trial found that exemestane, compared to tamoxifen, offered a significant early improvement in time to tumor progression as a first-line hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. The overall response rate was also greater for exemestane.
*   **Premenopausal Women:** For premenopausal women, studies have explored ovarian function suppression (OFS) combined with either tamoxifen or exemestane. Some data suggest a potential benefit of adding OFS to endocrine therapy, particularly in younger women who have received chemotherapy.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Sunitinib monotherapy compared to Cabozantinib monotherapy when used to treat Papillary renal cell carcinoma.,NCT02761057,"Based on the search results, here's a summary of the efficacy of cabozantinib monotherapy compared to sunitinib monotherapy in treating papillary renal cell carcinoma, along with the relevant clinical trial ID:

*   **Cabozantinib vs. Sunitinib in PAPMET Trial:** The PAPMET trial (a phase II trial) investigated MET kinase inhibitors in metastatic papillary renal carcinoma. It randomized patients to receive either sunitinib or cabozantinib. The response rate for cabozantinib was 23% compared to 4% for sunitinib, with a 4-month benefit for cabozantinib in overall survival (20 months vs 16 months). The median Progression Free Survival was significantly higher with cabozantinib.

*   **SWOG 1500 Trial:** The final overall survival results of the phase II SWOG 1500 trial indicated no significant overall survival benefit with cabozantinib vs sunitinib in patients with advanced papillary renal cell carcinoma. Cabozantinib significantly improved progression-free survival (9.0 vs 5.6 months) and objective response rate (23% vs 4%) compared with sunitinib.

While the searches mention CheckMate 9ER (NCT03141177), this trial primarily focused on the combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib versus sunitinib in advanced renal cell carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the PAPMET and SWOG 1500 trials, Cabozantinib monotherapy has demonstrated better outcomes than Sunitinib monotherapy.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy compared to Ibrutinib and Rituximab when used to treat Waldenstroem macroglobulinemia.,NCT02165397,"Based on the search results, here's a summary of the efficacy of Rituximab monotherapy compared to Ibrutinib and Rituximab in treating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, along with relevant clinical trial IDs:

**Efficacy Comparison:**

*   **Ibrutinib and Rituximab Combination Superior:** Multiple studies, including the iNNOVATE trial, have demonstrated that the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab shows significantly better outcomes compared to rituximab monotherapy. This includes:

    *   Higher overall response rates (ORR).
    *   Improved progression-free survival (PFS).
    *   Greater sustained hemoglobin improvement.
    *   Reduced risk of disease progression or death.
*   **iNNOVATE Trial Results:** The phase III iNNOVATE study showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), with a 54-month PFS rate of 68% for the ibrutinib-rituximab group compared to 25% for the placebo-rituximab group
*   **Impact of MYD88/CXCR4 Genotype:** Major responses with rituximab-ibrutinib were observed regardless of the MYD88/CXCR4 genotype

**Relevant Clinical Trial IDs:**

*   **NCT02165397:** This is the clinical trial ID for the iNNOVATE study, which compared ibrutinib plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab in WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia.
*   **NCT04061512:** This trial studies Rituximab and Ibrutinib (RI) Versus Dexamethasone, Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide (DRC) as Initial Therapy for WaldenstrÃ¶m's Macroglobulinemia.
*   **NCT04840602:** This trial evaluates the effects of ibrutinib and rituximab with or without venetoclax in treating patients with previously untreated Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

**In summary, the combination of Ibrutinib and Rituximab is more effective than Rituximab monotherapy for treating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.**
