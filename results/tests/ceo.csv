"determine who was the CEO of JANSSEN BIOTECH INCin Feb 17, 2023
Output it in the format CEO<CEO>",JANSSEN BIOTECH,"Based on the information available, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact CEO of Janssen Biotech, Inc. in February 2023.

Here's what I can infer:

*   Janssen Biotech, Inc. is one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.
*   It appears that leadership roles within Janssen Biotech might be structured more around functional areas or broader roles within Johnson & Johnson.
*   For example, Jennifer L. Taubert is mentioned as Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine at Johnson & Johnson, which would include oversight of Janssen's pharmaceutical activities.
*   Other leaders within Janssen Research & Development, LLC include Sen Zhuang (Vice President, Clinical Research and Development) and Yusri Elsayed (Vice President, Disease Area Leader, Hematologic Malignancies).

Therefore, without a definitive name for the CEO of Janssen Biotech in February 2023, the answer is undetermined.

"determine who was the CEO of PF PRISM CVin Sep 7, 2023
Output it in the format CEO<CEO>",PF PRISM CV,"Based on the search results, here's the information I found regarding CEOs of companies with ""PF PRISM CV"" or similar names as of September 7, 2023:

*   **Prism Johnson Ltd:** Anil Kulkarni was appointed as the new Executive Director and CEO on June 19, 2023.
*   **Prism Medical Products, LLC:** Chris Cartwright was the Founder and President of Prism Medical Products as of January 5, 2021.

It is important to note the following:

*   ""PF PRISM CV"" is associated with drugs from Pfizer. However, ""PF PRISM CV"" itself doesn't appear to be a company with a CEO. It seems to be a designation related to Pfizer's drug portfolio.
*   For Pfizer, Ian Read was CEO until 2010. It is important to look up who the CEO was on September 7, 2023, as the information in the search results is not specific to that date.

To provide a more precise answer, more information is needed to clarify which entity ""PF PRISM CV"" refers to.

"determine who was the CEO of AMRING PHARMACEUTICALS INCin Nov 13, 2009
Output it in the format CEO<CEO>",AMRING PHARMS,"Unfortunately, pinpointing the CEO of Amring Pharmaceuticals Inc. on November 13, 2009, is difficult. Here's what the search results indicate:

*   **Amring's Founding Date:** Several sources state that Amring Pharmaceuticals Inc. was founded in 2015. This suggests the company didn't exist in 2009.
*   **LYSTEDA Acquisition:** One search result mentions that LYSTEDA oral tablets received FDA approval on November 13, 2009. However, in 2009, LYSTEDA was acquired by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, not Amring Pharmaceuticals.
*   **Later CEO:** Daniel Carbery was mentioned as President and CEO of Amring in a 2020-2021 timeframe.
*   **Name Change:** Amring Pharmaceuticals Inc. changed its name to Nordic Pharma, Inc. on March 4, 2024.

Given the information available, it's highly unlikely that Amring Pharmaceuticals Inc. existed as a company on November 13, 2009. Therefore, it's impossible to determine who would have been the CEO at that time.
