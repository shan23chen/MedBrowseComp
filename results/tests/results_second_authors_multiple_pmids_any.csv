"Find/search the second author of any of the papers referenced in  that best describes the efficacy of Cisplatin and Topotecan compared to Cisplatin, Topotecan, Hydralazine, Valproate when used to treat Cervical cancer.
Output it in the format SA<Second Author>",Lucely Cetina,"Based on the search results, the most relevant study is a phase III clinical trial that evaluated the addition of hydralazine and valproate (HV) to cisplatin and topotecan (CT) in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Study Design:** Randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial.
*   **Treatment Groups:**
    *   Cisplatin + Topotecan + Hydralazine/Valproate (CT + HV)
    *   Cisplatin + Topotecan + Placebo (CT + PLA)
*   **Key Findings:** The study indicated a statistically significant advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) for the CT + HV group (10 months) compared to the CT + PLA group (6 months).

To find the second author of this study, I need to look at the publication details. Based on the search results, one relevant citation is:

*   Coronel et al., ""A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial of chemotherapy plus epigenetic therapy with hydralazine valproate for advanced cervical cancer. Preliminary results,"" *Medical Oncology*, 2011;28(Suppl 1):S540–S546.

Therefore, based on this information, the second author is unknown.

Output it in the format SA<Second Author>",Lucely Cetina,"Based on the information from the search results, here's the answer:

SA<Cetina>

**Explanation:**

*   Several sources ([1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10]) refer to a study examining hydralazine and valproate in combination with cisplatin and topotecan for cervical cancer.
*   Specifically, source [10] identifies Coronel J, Cetina L, et al. as authors of a relevant study (NCT00064077). Therefore, Cetina is the second author.

Output it in the format SA<Second Author>",Andrew Armstrong,"Based on the search results, here's the information you requested, focusing on studies comparing Tasquinimod monotherapy to placebo in prostate cancer:

**Study 1:**

*   **Reference:** A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study of maintenance therapy with tasquinimod in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer responsive to or stabilized during first-line docetaxel chemotherapy.
*   The median rPFS was 31.7 weeks in the tasquinimod arm and 22.7 weeks in the placebo arm.
