However, here's a breakdown of trials and considerations:

*   **Trials Comparing the Monotherapies:**
    *   Several sources ([1, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13]) discuss the use of both LoDAC and azacitidine as monotherapies in AML, particularly for patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Some studies compare them directly or in combination with other agents.

*   **Indirect Comparisons & Combination Therapies:**
    *   Many trials investigate azacitidine in combination with other drugs (e.g., venetoclax) and compare this combination to azacitidine monotherapy. These trials indirectly provide some efficacy data relative to the monotherapy, but the focus isn't a head-to-head LoDAC vs. Azacitidine comparison.
    *   NCT03926624: This trial uses LoDAC and Azacitidine combination regimens as a control arm against DFP-10917 in AML patients who have relapsed/refractory AML.

*   **Relevant Trial with Azacitidine Arm:**
    *   NCT04229979: This trial has an azacitidine arm within its ""Best Available Therapy"" arm for patients with AML in second complete remission. It is a phase III trial.

Therefore, based on the available information, **NCT04229979** may be the closest relevant trial, as it includes an azacitidine arm for comparison against a new therapy in AML patients.

    *   NCT03643276 looks at a treatment protocol that includes both drug combinations.
*   **Why it's difficult to find a direct comparison:**

    *   Treatment regimens for B-cell ALL in pediatric patients are complex and often tailored based on risk factors.

*   **CheckMate 9LA Study (mentioned in source 1):** While not a specific NCT ID, this study is referenced for showing that carboplatin with paclitaxel had a slightly better Hazard Ratio for Overall Survival than cisplatin with pemetrexed in squamous cell carcinoma. It also highlights the complexities of comparing different histological types of NSCLC.
*   **Studies mentioned in source 1:** A phase IB study by Kanda et al. demonstrated that the combination of nivolumab with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab had the best effect, while nivolumab with cisplatin and pemetrexed achieved poorer results. Similarly, Rizvi et al. demonstrated the best efficacy for the combination of 5 mg/kg nivolumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel, with 2-year OS of 62% versus 33% for the combination of cisplatin with pemetrexed.

"Find/search the clinical trial id that best describes the efficacy of Irinotecan monotherapy compared to IROX when used to treat Colorectal cancer.
Output it in the format NCT<Number>",NCT00012389,"While I can provide some information on clinical trials involving Irinotecan and IROX for colorectal cancer, pinpointing *the* single ""best"" trial ID is difficult because efficacy can be measured in different ways (overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, etc.) and different trials have different patient populations.

However, here's a breakdown of relevant trials and how to potentially find the most useful one for *your* specific needs:

**Key Trials & Findings:**

*   **IROX (Irinotecan + Oxaliplatin) vs. Irinotecan Monotherapy:**
    *   Haller et al. conducted a randomized phase 3 trial (PMID: 11867748) comparing IROX to irinotecan alone as a second-line treatment for mCRC after failure of fluoropyrimidine therapy. The study showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with IROX compared to irinotecan alone (13.4 vs. 11.1 months). IROX also showed benefits in objective response rate (ORR) and time-to-progression (TTP).

*   **Irinotecan Monotherapy Efficacy:**
    *   Cunningham et al. reported a trial where irinotecan + supportive care resulted in significantly greater overall survival than supportive care alone in patients who progressed on 5-FU therapy.
    *   Rougier et al. compared irinotecan to continuous infusion of 5-FU in patients with mCRC whose disease progressed on first-line bolus 5-FU. Irinotecan monotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared to infusional 5-FU.

**How to Find a Specific Clinical Trial ID (NCT Number):**

1.  **Identify Key Search Terms:** Start with the specifics of what you're looking for. For example:
    *   ""Irinotecan monotherapy vs IROX colorectal cancer""
    *   ""Irinotecan oxaliplatin colorectal cancer clinical trial""
    *   ""Second-line treatment colorectal cancer irinotecan clinical trial""
2.  **Use Clinical Trial Databases:**
    *   **[clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov):** This is the primary US government database of clinical trials. Use the search terms you identified to find relevant trials. The NCT number will be prominently displayed for each trial.
    *   **PubMed:** Search PubMed using similar search terms. Clinical trial publications often include the NCT number.
3.  **Examine Trial Publications:** Once you find a relevant publication (like the Haller et al. study mentioned above), look for the clinical trial registration number. It's often included in the abstract or methods section.

**Example Search on ClinicalTrials.gov:**

If you were to search clinicaltrials.gov for ""Irinotecan IROX colorectal cancer"", you would likely find several trials. Examine the results to find trials that specifically compare the two regimens and match your patient population of interest.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Specific Patient Population:** The ""best"" trial for you might depend on the specific characteristics of the patient you're considering (e.g., prior treatments, performance status).
*   **Outcomes of Interest:** Decide which outcome is most important to you (e.g., overall survival, quality of life) and look for trials that focused on that outcome.

Several trials have investigated this, but their designs, patient populations, and outcomes vary. However, I can provide you with some relevant trial information and IDs where available:

1.  **MRC TE21/EORTC 30983:** This trial compared BEP to T-BEP (paclitaxel-BEP) for intermediate-prognosis germ cell tumors. The results suggested T-BEP might be safe and help prevent recurrence, but the trial didn't recruit the planned number of participants.

2.  **EORTC 30983 Study:** A randomized phase III study comparing T-BEP to standard BEP in intermediate-prognosis germ cell cancer. While T-BEP with G-CSF appeared safe and effective, the study's primary analysis couldn't definitively prove T-BEP's statistical superiority due to a smaller-than-planned sample size and some ineligible patients.

3.  **A trial presented in European Urology compared CBOP/BEP to BEP** in patients with poor-prognosis germ cell tumors.

It's important to note that directly comparing these trials and their results can be complex due to differences in study design, patient populations, and other factors.

Here's a breakdown of findings from the search results, focusing on trials comparing FULV (Fluorouracil/Leucovorin) to FOLFIRI (Folinic acid, Fluorouracil, and Irinotecan) in colorectal cancer treatment:

*   **FULV vs. FOLFIRI:**

    *   Several Phase III trials have compared FOLFOX and FOLFIRI (both using infusional 5FU/LV as a backbone) and have shown similar response rates (54-56%) and PFS (8-8.5 months).
    *   FOLFIRI tends to have more side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and neutropenia, while FOLFOX has a higher chance of neuropathy.

It's important to note that the search results focus on trials comparing FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, both of which use FULV as a base. Direct comparisons of FULV alone vs. FOLFIRI are less common in first-line treatment due to the demonstrated benefits of adding either oxaliplatin or irinotecan to FULV.

Here's why and what I can offer:

*   **Heterogeneity of Trials:** Many clinical trials have investigated this comparison, but they vary significantly in their specific protocols (doses, schedules, combinations with other drugs), patient populations (age, risk factors, prior treatment), and endpoints (remission rate, survival, toxicity).
*   **Meta-Analyses:** Meta-analyses ([7]) exist that combine data from multiple trials, but they don't provide a single NCT number.
*   **No Single ""Best"" Answer:** The ""best"" trial might depend on the specific context you're interested in (e.g., a particular patient subgroup).

**Here's what I can suggest based on the search results:**

1.  **JPLSG AML-12 Trial:** ([4]) This is a Japan Children's Cancer Group trial that compares high-dose Ara-C in induction therapy to standard induction therapy (ECM) in children with de novo AML. While the search results do not explicitly provide the NCT ID, this trial appears relevant to your question. You may be able to find the NCT ID by searching for ""JPLSG AML-12 NCT ID"".

2.  **Trials Mentioned in Meta-Analysis:** The meta-analysis ([7]) includes 22 trials that compare high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) to standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) in AML. Reviewing the trials included in this meta-analysis could be a good starting point.

3.  **Other Relevant Trials**

    *   MRC AML-HR trial ([2]) This trial compares standard chemotherapy comprising cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE) to fludarabine and high-dose cytosine (FLA). While not a direct comparison of standard vs. high-dose Ara-C, it uses ADE as a standard treatment arm.

Output it in the format NCT<Number>",NCT00412022,"While I can provide information about trials investigating letrozole and OFS versus tamoxifen and OFS, pinpointing the *single* ""best"" trial based solely on efficacy is difficult. Here's why, and how to approach finding relevant trials:

*   **Multiple Trials, Different Designs:** Several trials have compared these treatments. Each has slightly different patient populations, definitions of efficacy (e.g., disease-free survival vs. overall survival), and follow-up times.
*   **Efficacy Endpoints:** ""Efficacy"" can be measured in various ways. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) are common, but trials may also look at recurrence rates, distant recurrence, etc.
*   **Subgroup Analyses:** The ""best"" treatment may vary depending on patient characteristics (age, stage of cancer, prior chemotherapy, etc.). Trials often include subgroup analyses.

With that in mind, here's how to find potentially relevant trials and some examples:

1.  **Key Trials to Consider**

    *   **SOFT (Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial):** This trial compared tamoxifen alone, tamoxifen + OFS, or exemestane + OFS. It's a major study in this area.
    *   **TEXT (Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial):** This trial compared tamoxifen + OFS directly to exemestane + OFS.
    *   **HOBOE trial:** This trial compared letrozole-OFS with tamoxifen-OFS

2.  **How to Search Clinical Trial Databases:**
    *Go to websites like clinicaltrials.gov
    *Search for breast cancer trials, and use keywords like ""letrozole"", ""tamoxifen"", ""ovarian suppression"", ""OFS"", ""premenopausal"".
    *Look for trials that directly compare the treatments of interest.
    *Examine the inclusion/exclusion criteria to see if the patient population matches your specific case.

It's important to remember that treatment decisions are complex and should be made in consultation with a qualified oncologist.

However, several studies and meta-analyses provide indirect comparisons and relevant information.

Here's a summary of findings from the search results:

*   **Indirect Comparisons & Meta-Analyses:** Several meta-analyses ([1], [6], [8]) compare Azacitidine (AZA) and Decitabine (DAC) indirectly by comparing each drug to conventional care regimens (CCR) or best supportive care (BSC). These analyses suggest:

    *   Both AZA and DAC improve overall response (OR) rate and overall survival (OS) compared to CCR ([1]).
    *   DAC may have a higher complete remission (CR) rate than AZA, but AZA may have lower toxicity ([1], [6]).
    *   AZA showed better AML-free survival, while DAC had a higher possibility of achieving better CR and ORR, and AZA had the possibility of obtaining better OS with lower toxicity. ([6]).
    *   One meta-analysis showed a survival benefit for AZA but not for DAC when compared to conventional care ([2]).
*   **Phase II Study:** One phase II study directly compared low doses of Decitabine and Azacitidine and found that Decitabine was more effective in patients with higher IPSS-R scores ([7]).
*   **Retrospective Study:** A recent retrospective study found that Azacitidine showed a statistically significant greater overall survival probability and reduced risk of death compared to Decitabine ([12]).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Recurrent vs. Newly Diagnosed:** Note that some trials focus on *recurrent* ovarian cancer (where the cancer has come back after initial treatment), while others focus on *newly diagnosed* ovarian cancer. The best trial for your needs depends on the specific patient scenario.
*   **Platinum Sensitivity:** Several trials specify ""platinum-sensitive"" recurrent ovarian cancer, meaning the cancer responded to initial platinum-based chemotherapy and recurred after a certain interval.
*   **Phase of Trial:** Phase 3 trials generally provide more robust evidence than Phase 2 trials.
*   **Bevacizumab Dose and Schedule:** The dose and schedule of bevacizumab administration can vary between trials.

A direct comparison against observation isn't the typical study design. However, here's a breakdown of relevant trials and why they are important:

*   **APEX Trial:** The APEX trial compared bortezomib monotherapy to high-dose dexamethasone (HDD) in relapsed multiple myeloma. While not a direct comparison to ""observation,"" it established bortezomib as an effective treatment compared to a standard of care. The BLOOD RESEARCH journal notes it reported a better overall response rate (ORR) (38% vs. 18%), a better time-to-progression (TTP), and a 1-year overall survival (OS) (80% vs. 66%) compared to high-dose dexamethasone.

*   **Bortezomib plus Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin vs Bortezomib Alone:** This study demonstrated that while the combination initially showed superior time to progression, long-term follow-up revealed that the combination did not improve overall survival compared with bortezomib alone in relapsed/refractory MM. This highlights the efficacy of bortezomib monotherapy as a baseline.

    *   **NCT04075292:** This trial compares acalabrutinib monotherapy to chlorambucil plus rituximab in previously untreated CLL. This could be relevant as it benchmarks a rituximab combination against a newer monotherapy.
    *   **NCT04666038:** This trial studies LOXO-305 versus investigator's choice of idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab in BTK inhibitor pretreated CLL. It highlights rituximab's use in combination in later lines of therapy.
    *   A study mentioned in one of the articles (though without a specific NCT ID) compares chlorambucil alone to chlorambucil and rituximab. This would be a more direct comparison of rituximab's added benefit.
*   **Trials of Rituximab monotherapy (without a direct observation arm):** These trials demonstrate the efficacy of rituximab on its own.
    *   A study by Thomas et al., mentioned in one of the articles, gave eight weekly doses of rituximab to previously untreated, early-stage CLL patients.
    *   Another study by Hainsworth et al. gave four weekly doses of rituximab to previously untreated, symptomatic patients with CLL.

**In summary:** While there isn't a perfect ""Rituximab monotherapy vs. Observation"" trial ID readily available in these results, the closest and perhaps most relevant would be studies that evaluate rituximab monotherapy in early-stage CLL patients, even without a direct observation arm for comparison. You could also look at trials that compare a rituximab-containing regimen to a chemotherapy-only approach.

**Key Findings & Considerations:**

*   **Docetaxel vs. Paclitaxel:** Several studies suggest docetaxel may have greater efficacy than paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but often with increased toxicity.
*   **TAX 311 Study:** This phase III trial directly compared docetaxel and paclitaxel as monotherapy for advanced breast cancer. It's a head-to-head randomized study.
*   **nab-Paclitaxel:** Some research focuses on nab-paclitaxel (an albumin-bound form) compared to docetaxel. nab-paclitaxel may offer a better therapeutic index.
*   **Sequencing:** Some trials examine docetaxel after paclitaxel resistance.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Many trials involve taxanes in combination with other drugs (e.g., carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab), which complicates direct comparisons of docetaxel vs. paclitaxel monotherapy.

**Potentially Relevant Clinical Trial ID:**

*   **NCT04547907:** This trial (HELEN-006) investigates nab-paclitaxel *monotherapy* plus dual HER2 blockade vs. docetaxel plus carboplatin and dual HER2 blockade in HER2-positive early breast cancer.
