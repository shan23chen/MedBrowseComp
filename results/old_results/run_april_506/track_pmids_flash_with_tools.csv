Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",18073378,"Based on the search results, identifying a single PubMed ID that *directly* compares Anastrozole monotherapy *versus* observation alone is challenging. Many studies compare Anastrozole to Tamoxifen or investigate its use in specific scenarios (e.g., after Tamoxifen treatment). However, result [2] discusses the ABCSG Trial 6a, which is relevant.

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Abiraterone monotherapy compared to Prednisone monotherapy when used to treat Prostate cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",29264210,"Based on the search results, it's difficult to pinpoint a single paper that *directly* compares abiraterone monotherapy to prednisone monotherapy. Abiraterone is almost always used *with* prednisone in prostate cancer treatment. However, here's the closest information I can provide, keeping in mind the nuances:

*   **Why Abiraterone is Typically Used with Prednisone:** Abiraterone acetate suppresses testosterone and cortisol production. This leads to a rise in cortisol precursors with mineralocorticoid activity. Prednisone is co-administered to counter this, reducing side effects like hypokalemia, hypertension, and fluid retention.

*   **Indirect Comparison & Key Trials:** The COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302 trials are frequently referenced. These trials studied abiraterone *with* prednisone versus placebo *with* prednisone. While not a direct comparison of abiraterone monotherapy vs. prednisone monotherapy, they highlight the *added* benefit of abiraterone when combined with prednisone.

    *   COU-AA-301: Abiraterone + prednisone in patients who had prior docetaxel chemotherapy.
    *   COU-AA-302: Abiraterone + prednisone in patients who were chemotherapy-naïve.

*   **Abiraterone Monotherapy Considerations:** One of the search snippets mentions early clinical data suggesting abiraterone can be administered *without* prednisone, and mineralocorticoid adverse effects can be managed with eplerenone. However, this isn't a direct head-to-head comparison with prednisone monotherapy.

Given this, and keeping in mind the common clinical practice, it's difficult to provide a single, definitive PubMed ID for a study comparing abiraterone monotherapy *directly* to prednisone monotherapy. The existing research focuses on abiraterone + prednisone versus placebo + prednisone.

It's important to note that treatment decisions should always be made in consultation with a qualified medical professional.

*   **Rituximab Maintenance:** The AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance trial ([1]) investigated rituximab *maintenance* (after initial chemoimmunotherapy) versus observation. It found that rituximab maintenance prolonged progression-free survival compared to observation alone.
*   **Rituximab in Combination:** Some studies explore rituximab in combination with other agents like chemotherapy (e.g., FCR regimen) or novel agents. These combinations often show efficacy in CLL treatment, but it's not a direct comparison of rituximab monotherapy vs. observation.
*   **Network Meta-Analyses:** Several meta-analyses ([2], [6], [8]) compare various treatment regimens for CLL, including those with rituximab. These often focus on relapsed/refractory CLL and compare novel targeted agents, sometimes including venetoclax plus rituximab as a favorable option.
*   **Rituximab Monotherapy Limitations:** One search result ([4]) mentions that rituximab monotherapy is substantially less effective in CLL than in follicular lymphoma.
*   **Zanubrutinib Plus Rituximab:** One study ([5]) examines time-limited therapy with zanubrutinib plus rituximab, followed by observation. This approach shows promising early results, but it's not a direct comparison of rituximab monotherapy vs. observation.

However, I can provide information from studies that evaluate these treatments separately and in combination with other therapies, which may help you draw some comparisons:

**Gemcitabine Monotherapy:**

*   Gemcitabine monotherapy in elderly patients with NSCLC produced an overall response rate of 22.2–38.5% with minimal toxicities.
*   Some studies have reported that Gemcitabine consistently yields response rates that exceed 20% when used as a single agent.

**Durvalumab and Tremelimumab:**

*   Adding tremelimumab to durvalumab and chemotherapy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone.
*   In a phase III trial, durvalumab was associated with a significantly higher overall survival than placebo and increased progression-free survival in limited-stage small cell lung cancer after chemoradiotherapy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   The information available often discusses durvalumab and tremelimumab in combination with chemotherapy, rather than as a direct comparison to gemcitabine monotherapy.
*   Efficacy can vary based on factors like PD-L1 expression, specific genetic mutations (e.g., STK11, KRAS), and the overall health and age of the patient.

**Relevant Studies (though not a direct comparison):**

*   **POSEIDON trial:** Evaluated tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in metastatic NSCLC. It showed significant improvements in both PFS and OS with the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab and chemotherapy.
*   **MYSTIC trial:** Assessed durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in treatment-naïve stage IV NSCLC patients. The combination of durvalumab plus tremelimumab did not meet the primary endpoint of improving PFS compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 ≥25%.

*   **RESOLVE Trial:** The RESOLVE trial (PMID: 34252374) compared perioperative/adjuvant SOX to adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapOx) in locally advanced gastric cancer. While it didn't directly compare SOX to S-1 monotherapy, it established the benefit of SOX over CapOx. It also provides a good overview of SOX regimens.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Erlotinib + Bevacizumab vs. Erlotinib Monotherapy:** Multiple meta-analyses ([1], [2], [4], [5]) indicate that combining Erlotinib and Bevacizumab improves Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLC compared to Erlotinib alone. However, these combinations did not show a significant improvement in Overall Survival (OS) or Objective Response Rate (ORR). Furthermore, the combination is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events like hypertension, proteinuria, and other grade 3 or higher adverse events.
*   **Bevacizumab Monotherapy:** One source [3] mentions a retrospective analysis showing that Bevacizumab maintenance monotherapy had a benefit in PFS compared to the control group, but no benefit in OS was observed.

Based on the information available, it appears that there isn't a direct comparison of Bevacizumab *monotherapy* versus Erlotinib and Bevacizumab combination therapy within these search results.

*   **Result [13]** discusses BCIRG 006. This trial compared ACTH (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) and TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab), but it doesn't include AC-D (docetaxel alone).

**Conclusion**

Based on the available information, it's difficult to pinpoint a single paper that *directly* compares AC-TH to AC-D. The closest relevant paper appears to be **Result [2]** which compares TAC to FAC, establishing the efficacy of docetaxel in node-positive breast cancer.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",26482278,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint a single paper that *directly* compares Etirinotecan pegol monotherapy *head-to-head* against Eribulin monotherapy in breast cancer treatment. However, I can offer some relevant information and potentially useful leads:

*   **BEACON Trial & Etirinotecan Pegol:** The ""BEACON"" trial evaluated Etirinotecan pegol versus Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC). While TPC could include Eribulin, the study wasn't a direct comparison. A key finding was that there wasn't a statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) between Etirinotecan pegol and TPC. However, some subgroup analyses suggested Etirinotecan pegol prolonged OS in patients with brain metastases or liver metastases.
*   **Eribulin's Efficacy:** Several studies highlight the efficacy of Eribulin monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), especially in heavily pretreated patients. Some studies compare Eribulin to other chemotherapies like vinorelbine or capecitabine.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Some recent research explores Eribulin in combination with other agents (e.g., anlotinib) and compares this combination to Eribulin monotherapy.

Given the lack of a direct comparison study, here are a couple of options, depending on what you're looking for:

1.  **For Information on Etirinotecan Pegol:** Look for the primary publication of the BEACON trial. While it doesn't directly compare to Eribulin, it provides the most detail on Etirinotecan pegol's efficacy versus a physician's choice of treatment (which *could* be Eribulin in some cases).
2.  **For Eribulin Monotherapy Efficacy:** Search for studies specifically evaluating Eribulin monotherapy in heavily pretreated MBC patients.

It's important to recognize that without a direct head-to-head trial, drawing definitive conclusions about the *comparative* efficacy of these two agents is difficult.

This analysis (PMID not explicitly provided in the snippet, but findable via search) found a higher ORR, and better progression-free and overall survival with nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin compared to solvent-based paclitaxel + carboplatin in Japanese patients. It also noted differences in adverse event profiles.

**3. NEPTUN Study (Real-World Data):**

*   Sources [5] and [7] discuss the NEPTUN study, a non-interventional study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin as first-line therapy in advanced NSCLC in a real-world setting (Germany). Source [7] provides the *PubMed* ID: 36757197.

**4. CAPITAL Trial:**

*   Source [6] discusses the CAPITAL trial, which compared carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel versus docetaxel as first-line therapy for patients aged 70 years and older with advanced squamous NSCLC. While it doesn't directly compare to carboplatin and paclitaxel, it suggests that carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel can be used as standard first-line treatment for these patients due to longer overall survival.

**Recommendation:**

To identify the ""best"" paper, consider:

*   **Focus of Interest:** Are you specifically interested in a Phase III trial, real-world data, or a specific subgroup (e.g., elderly patients)?
*   **Outcomes:** What outcomes are most important to you (ORR, PFS, OS, safety profile)?

Given the initial request for a paper describing efficacy, I would recommend focusing on the Phase III trial and its subgroup analyses (Japanese). You may also consider the NEPTUN study for real-world evidence.

Here's a breakdown of relevant findings and why pinpointing a single ""best"" paper is difficult:

*   **Rituximab Primarily Studied in Combination:** Rituximab is most often studied and used in combination with other therapies (chemotherapy, targeted agents). Many studies focus on these combinations rather than rituximab alone versus observation.

*   **Maintenance Therapy Studies:** Some studies examine rituximab as maintenance therapy *after* initial treatment, comparing maintenance rituximab to observation. These aren't exactly ""monotherapy vs. observation"" in the initial treatment sense.

*   **Limited Efficacy as Monotherapy:** The search results suggest rituximab monotherapy has limitations in CLL, particularly compared to its use in lymphomas.

**Potentially Relevant Paper:**

While not a direct ""monotherapy vs. observation"" study, this paper is relevant as it discusses Rituximab maintenance versus observation:

*   **AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance Trial:** ""[1] Rituximab maintenance versus observation alone in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who respond to first-line or second-line rituximab-containing chemoimmunotherapy: final results of the AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance randomised trial - PubMed""

    *   This study ( PMID not explicitly available in the snippet, you'd need to look up ""AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance"" in PubMed to get the PMID) compares rituximab maintenance to observation in patients who already responded to chemoimmunotherapy. It found a longer progression-free survival in the rituximab group.

**Why No Single ""Best"" Paper?**

*   The treatment landscape for CLL has evolved. Initial treatment strategies have shifted with the advent of novel agents (BTK inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors).
*   Monotherapy is less common than combination approaches, so studies directly comparing rituximab monotherapy to observation are less frequent in recent years.

In summary, while a direct ""rituximab monotherapy vs. observation"" study is hard to pinpoint as the *best*, the AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance trial (find the PMID in PubMed) addresses a related question of maintenance rituximab versus observation after initial treatment.

Research often looks at broader treatment protocols or compares different aspects of these regimens.

However, here's how to approach this and some potentially relevant leads:

**PubMed Search Strategy:**

A highly specific search is key. You've already started well. Consider variations like:

*   ""childhood ALL mercaptopurine methotrexate vincristine asparaginase pegaspargase comparison""
*   ""pediatric B-ALL treatment protocols mercaptopurine methotrexate""
*   Add terms like ""efficacy,"" ""randomized controlled trial,"" or ""outcome"" to refine the search.

**Why it's tricky to get a direct answer:**

*   **Treatment protocols are complex:** ALL treatment involves multiple phases (induction, consolidation, maintenance) and many drugs. Studies often evaluate entire protocols, not just single drug swaps.
*   **Pegaspargase is common:** Pegaspargase (a longer-acting form of asparaginase) is a standard component of many modern ALL protocols. It is often compared to native L-asparaginase, not necessarily the omission of asparaginase altogether.
*   **Focus on Minimal Residual Disease (MRD):** Many current studies focus on MRD as a way to tailor therapy. They might adjust asparaginase dosing or other drugs based on MRD response.

Given the information available, I am unable to provide a specific pubmed ID that directly answers your question. More information may be available with a more specific search.

**Key Findings & Relevant Studies:**

*   **Cisplatin/Pemetrexed vs. Carboplatin/Pemetrexed - General Efficacy:** Several sources suggest similar efficacy between cisplatin-based and carboplatin-based chemotherapy when combined with pemetrexed, particularly when also combined with immunotherapy. The choice often depends on toxicity profiles.
*   **Nivolumab Combinations:**
    *   One study ([1]) suggests nivolumab with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab might have better outcomes than nivolumab with cisplatin and pemetrexed. However, this needs careful interpretation based on the specific study design and patient populations.
    *  Study [2, 3] compares Nivolumab alone to Carboplatin-Pemetrexed in EGFR-mutated NSCLC resistant to EGFR TKIs. Nivolumab did *not* confer a longer Progression Free Survival (PFS) compared to Carboplatin-Pemetrexed in this study population.
*   **IMpower132 and KEYNOTE-189:** These studies ([1]) indicate that the addition of a platinum agent to pemetrexed and immunotherapy has a similar effect, regardless of whether it's cisplatin or carboplatin. This suggests the platinum component is important for efficacy.
*   **CheckMate 9LA:** This study ([1]) showed only a slightly better Hazard Ratio (HR) for Overall Survival (OS) in squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel versus adenocarcinoma patients treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed when combined with nivolumab.

**Potential Relevant Papers (PubMed IDs if available):**

It is difficult to identify a single paper. However, based on the information found, the following articles might be relevant to your query:

*   ""[1] Can Previous Chemotherapy Affect the Outcome of Nivolumab Treatment in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer?"" While it doesn't directly compare all the regimens you listed, it discusses studies comparing nivolumab combinations with different platinum-based chemotherapies.

    *   I could not find the pmid for this paper.

**General Notes:**

*   Many studies focus on comparing platinum-based doublets (cisplatin/pemetrexed vs. carboplatin/paclitaxel) *without* the addition of Nivolumab or other immunotherapies.
*   The KEYNOTE-189 trial is a landmark study that established platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (often carboplatin) plus pembrolizumab as a standard of care.
*   Some studies suggest that the specific platinum agent (cisplatin vs. carboplatin) may not be as crucial as the inclusion of a platinum agent within a chemoimmunotherapy regimen.

**In summary, it's challenging to provide a single ""best"" paper with a PMID that directly compares all the regimens you listed.** The optimal choice depends on factors like patient characteristics (frailty, EGFR/ALK status, PD-L1 expression), treatment line, and specific clinical goals.

**Lenalidomide Monotherapy:**

*   A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated lenalidomide monotherapy in relapsed/refractory DLBCL. The cumulative objective response rate (ORR) was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.40), with better responses in the non-GCB phenotype (ORR 0.50) compared to the GCB phenotype (ORR 0.06). The median progression-free survival (PFS) ranged from 2.6 to 34 months, and overall survival (OS) ranged from 7.8 to 37 months. This suggests lenalidomide monotherapy has activity in DLBCL, particularly in the non-GCB subtype.

**Etoposide in DLBCL Regimens:**

*   While etoposide is a component of multi-drug regimens like EPOCH, information on etoposide *monotherapy* efficacy in DLBCL is limited in the search results.

However, here's a breakdown of relevant findings and some potentially useful PubMed IDs:

*   **Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (TD) Combination Superiority:** Several sources indicate that the combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone (TD) generally shows improved response rates compared to thalidomide alone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
*   **Dexamethasone Monotherapy as a Comparator:** Some studies use dexamethasone alone as a comparator arm when evaluating new treatments or combinations. For example, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (RD) is often compared to dexamethasone alone.
*   **Thalidomide's Role:** Thalidomide's use has diminished somewhat due to tolerability issues and the advent of newer agents like lenalidomide. It remains an option in some cases, particularly if patients are thalidomide-naive.

Given this, a paper that uses dexamethasone monotherapy as a comparator could provide some insight, even if it's not a direct head-to-head comparison focused *solely* on dexamethasone vs. TD.

While I cannot give you *the* definitive ""best"" paper based on the current search, here are some potentially relevant PMIDs from the search results that might be a good starting point for your research:

*   From result \[3] that talks about how heavily pretreated patients with RRMM who received lenalidomide 25 mg in combination with dexamethasone (Rd) showed a significantly better ORR (60.6% vs. 21.9%), CR (15.0% vs. 2.0%), TTP (13.4 vs. 4.6 mo), and OS (38.0 vs. 31.6 mo) compared with a dexamethasone-only group:  Although the study focuses on lenalidomide, it uses dexamethasone monotherapy as a comparison.  You'd need to examine the cited papers within this article to see the original source of this data.
*   From result \[2] that says Thalidomide monotherapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) has a response rate of 30%. The combination of thalidomide with dexamethasone (Thal/Dex) is expected to improve responses.

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of MOPP-ABV, then Radiation therapy compared to Radiation therapy when used to treat Classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",17989384,"Based on the search results, it's difficult to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of MOPP-ABV and radiation therapy versus radiation therapy alone for Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. However, here's a breakdown of relevant studies and how to interpret them, along with potential leads for finding specific PubMed IDs:

**Key Studies and Findings**

*   **H8-F Trial:** This trial compared MOPP-ABV ×3 plus Involved Field Radiation Therapy (IFRT) with subtotal nodal irradiation alone (STNI) in favorable early-stage HL. MOPP-ABV + IFRT showed significantly higher 5-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) and 10-year Overall Survival (OS). This suggests a benefit to combined modality treatment in this specific scenario.
*   **EORTC Study:** This study randomized patients in complete response after MOPP-ABV to either no further treatment or IFRT. There was *no* significant difference in Event-Free Survival (EFS) or Overall Survival (OS) between the groups. This indicates that in patients achieving complete remission with MOPP-ABV, radiation might not add benefit.
*   **GHSG HD-7:** Compared ABVD ×2 plus Extended Field Radiation Therapy (EFRT) to EFRT alone in favorable stages I and II. Combined treatment had better freedom from treatment failure, but overall survival was similar.
*   **CALGB Study:** Compared MOPP alone, MOPP alternating with ABVD, and ABVD alone in advanced HL. MOPP was inferior, and ABVD was as effective as MOPP/ABVD, with less myelosuppression.

**Challenges in Direct Comparison**

*   **Evolution of Treatment:** MOPP-ABV is an older regimen. Current standards often involve ABVD or BEACOPP, sometimes with modifications, and the role of radiation is increasingly tailored based on PET scans.
*   **Stage and Risk Factors:** The effectiveness of different approaches depends heavily on the stage of the lymphoma (early vs. advanced), risk factors, and response to initial chemotherapy.
*   **Radiation Techniques:** The type of radiation therapy matters. IFRT is more targeted than older techniques like EFRT, potentially reducing side effects.
*   **PET Imaging:** Many modern protocols use PET scans to assess response and guide radiation decisions. Studies from the pre-PET era may not be directly applicable.

**How to Find Relevant PubMed IDs**

1.  **Identify Key Trials:** Based on the descriptions above, pick the trial that best matches your specific question (e.g., early-stage favorable HL, comparing MOPP-ABV + IFRT to radiation alone).
2.  **Search PubMed:** Use a precise search query in PubMed. For example, if you are interested in the H8-F trial, search for:

    *   `""H8-F trial"" Hodgkin lymphoma MOPP-ABV radiation`
    *   `Ferme C ""H8-F trial"" Hodgkin lymphoma` (using the first author's name if known)
3.  **Look for Meta-Analyses/Reviews:** Search for systematic reviews or meta-analyses that address your question. These articles often summarize the findings of multiple studies and provide a broader perspective. Search PubMed for:

    *   `""Hodgkin lymphoma"" MOPP-ABV ""radiation therapy"" meta-analysis`
    *   `""Hodgkin lymphoma"" ABVD ""radiation therapy"" review`
4.  **Check Cited References:** Once you find a relevant article, look at the papers it cites. This can lead you to other important studies.

**Important Considerations**

*   **Publication Date:** Be aware of the publication date. Older studies may not reflect current treatment approaches.
*   **Study Design:** Pay attention to the study design (randomized controlled trial, retrospective analysis, etc.). Randomized trials provide the strongest evidence.
*   **Patient Population:** Consider the patient population included in the study. Are they similar to the patients you're interested in?
*   **Outcomes:** What outcomes were measured (overall survival, progression-free survival, etc.)? Do they address your question?

Once you've identified a paper that closely addresses your question, you can find its PubMed ID (PMID) on the PubMed website.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",29229324,"Based on the search results, several studies discuss the efficacy of radiation therapy compared to observation in treating Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. A particularly relevant study is the UK RAPID trial, which investigated the possibility of avoiding radiotherapy altogether in patients with a negative interim PET scan after three cycles of ABVD. The results showed a difference in the 3-year PFS rates, favoring combined modality therapy (chemotherapy and IFRT) over chemotherapy alone. Another relevant trial is the North American Children's Oncology Group CCG 5942 trial, where children who achieved CR after chemotherapy were randomized into low-dose IF-RT or no further treatment and showed a significant difference in event-free survival favoring the radiotherapy group.

    *   However, the trial was terminated early due to concerns about vascular adverse events associated with ponatinib.

*   **Ponatinib in resistant/intolerant CML:**
    *   Ponatinib has demonstrated significant activity in CML patients resistant or intolerant to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including imatinib.
    *   The **PACE trial** was a phase 2 trial that included patients with chronic-phase CML resistant to multiple prior TKIs. Ponatinib showed deep and durable responses in this population.
    *   Notably, ponatinib is effective against the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to most other TKIs.

Therefore, while a direct comparison in newly diagnosed patients was cut short, the available data, particularly from the PACE trial, highlights the efficacy of ponatinib in patients who have failed imatinib and other TKIs.

While gemcitabine monotherapy has been a standard treatment, studies have explored combination therapies to improve outcomes. The GIP-1 study (PMID: 20354204) suggests that adding cisplatin to gemcitabine may not provide a significant advantage. The study with PMID 15925814 suggests the PEFG regimen might be a consideration, though with increased toxicity. Different gemcitabine schedules (PMID: 21519814) can also impact toxicity.

*   **Rituximab Hycela requires initial IV Rituximab:** It's important to note that Rituxan Hycela is only administered *after* the patient has received at least one full dose of intravenous Rituxan (rituximab).

*   **SABRINA Study:** The ""SABRINA"" study (NCT01200758) is a relevant study. It was a randomized, multi-center study that included patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. It compared intravenous rituximab to Rituxan Hycela in combination with CHOP or CVP chemotherapy.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",33626197,"While I can't pinpoint a single paper that *perfectly* and definitively compares FLAG to azacitidine monotherapy in AML, here's a breakdown of relevant information from the search results and how to potentially find the best paper:

**Challenges:**

*   **FLAG is typically used as intensive induction therapy.** Azacitidine is often used for patients unfit for intensive chemo. Direct comparisons are less common because they are used in different patient populations.
*   **The treatment landscape is evolving.** Many studies now focus on combinations (e.g., azacitidine + venetoclax) rather than azacitidine alone.

**Here's what the search revealed, and how to proceed:**

1.  **Azacitidine as a Standard (Especially for Older/Unfit Patients):**
    *   Azacitidine is a recommended front-line treatment for older AML patients who can't tolerate intensive regimens ([5]).
    *   It has shown benefit over supportive care in intermediate/high-risk MDS and AML (eviQ document \[2]).

2.  **FLAG Regimens (Intensive):**
    *   FLAG (often with idarubicin) is associated with high complete remission rates ([3]).
    *   A study combined FLAG-IDA with venetoclax in newly diagnosed AML, showing promising results ([1, 4]).

3.  **Indirect Comparisons & Evolving Standards:**
    *   The VIALE-A trial ([4, 10]) showed azacitidine + venetoclax significantly improved overall survival compared to azacitidine alone in patients ineligible for intensive chemo.
    *   There's research into combining FLT3 or IDH inhibitors with azacitidine ([4, 7, 8]). Gilteritinib + azacitidine was compared to azacitidine alone in FLT3-mutated AML, but OS wasn't significantly different ([4, 7]).
    *   Some data suggests azacitidine may prolong survival similarly to other AML treatments, but with less toxicity ([5]).

4.  **Why a Direct Comparison is Difficult:**
    *   A key point is that azacitidine is often used when intensive chemo (like FLAG) isn't an option. So, a head-to-head trial would be ethically challenging to design.

**How to Find the ""Best"" Paper:**

*   **Focus on specific patient subgroups:** Are you interested in a specific age group, risk category, or AML subtype (e.g., FLT3-mutated)? This will narrow your search.
*   **Look for retrospective studies:** These may compare outcomes of patients who received FLAG-based therapy vs. azacitidine based on real-world treatment decisions.
*   **Consider combination therapies:** Since azacitidine monotherapy is becoming less common, look for studies that compare FLAG to azacitidine-based combinations (e.g., azacitidine + venetoclax). This might give you a more relevant comparison.
*   **Use PubMed with very specific keywords:** Try searches like:
    *   ""FLAG chemotherapy"" ""azacitidine"" ""acute myeloid leukemia"" ""outcomes""
    *   ""intensive chemotherapy"" ""hypomethylating agent"" ""AML"" ""comparative study""
    *   ""AML"" ""FLAG"" ""azacitidine"" ""elderly"" (if that's your population of interest)
*   **Check the cited articles:** When you find a relevant paper, look at the articles it cites. This can lead you to other important research.

The median survival time (MST) was 13.37 months for HAIF plus sorafenib versus 7.13 months for sorafenib alone (P<0.001). The objective response rate (ORR) was also significantly higher in the combination group (40.8% vs 2.46%, P<0.01).
*   **HAIC Efficacy**: HAIC is recommended for advanced HCC in Japan, with high response rates, favorable long-term outcomes, and acceptable toxicities.
*   **HAIC FOLFOX vs Sorafenib:** A large sample retrospective study showed that hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) monotherapy can significantly improve survival compared with sorafenib for advanced HCC (median OS 14.5 vs. 7.0 months; P<0.001).

Given the information, it appears that studies comparing HAIC FOLFOX *alone* versus sorafenib monotherapy may be less common than studies of HAIC FOLFOX *plus* sorafenib versus sorafenib monotherapy.

*   **Lyu et al. [92]** evaluated in a phase II study the comparison between 180 patients treated with HAI FOLFOX-6 vs. 232 patients treated with Sorafenib (400 mg twice daily).

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",22730113,"Based on the search results, identifying a single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of dexamethasone monotherapy compared to thalidomide and dexamethasone (TD) in multiple myeloma is challenging. The results highlight several relevant studies, but they often focus on combination therapies or compare dexamethasone to other treatments. Here's a summary of findings and potential avenues for identifying the specific paper you need:

*   **Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (TD) is a common comparison point:** Several papers discuss the efficacy of TD in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. These provide a baseline for comparison.
*   **Dexamethasone Monotherapy:** Some results mention dexamethasone monotherapy, but often in the context of comparing it to other monotherapies or as part of combination regimens.
*   **Bortezomib and Dexamethasone:** One study directly compares bortezomib plus dexamethasone versus bortezomib monotherapy.
*   **Thalidomide vs Dexamethasone:** One paper compares thalidomide monotherapy to dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

To pinpoint the *best* paper, consider these approaches:

1.  **Review Article Citations:** Look at the references within the review articles identified in the search results. These reviews may cite the specific study you're looking for.
2.  **Narrowed Search Terms:** Try more specific PubMed searches like:

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",28804126,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint a single paper that ""best"" describes the efficacy of Fludarabine monotherapy compared to observation. Here's why, and how to interpret the information:

*   **Observation vs. Active Treatment:** The primary focus in CLL research has shifted *away* from observation alone when active treatment is indicated. Initial studies compared fludarabine to older treatments like chlorambucil.
*   **Evolution of Treatment:** Fludarabine monotherapy, while a significant advance, is generally *not* considered the gold standard anymore, especially with the advent of chemoimmunotherapy (like Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + Rituximab - FCR) and targeted agents.
*   **Study Focus:** Many studies compare fludarabine *combinations* to fludarabine alone, or fludarabine to older agents (like chlorambucil). Finding a direct comparison of fludarabine *vs.* observation is difficult because it's often considered unethical to *withhold* treatment if a patient needs it.

With all of this being said, here's how to approach interpreting the findings with that in mind:

*   **Fludarabine vs. Chlorambucil:** Several sources ([1, 2, 7]) show fludarabine monotherapy was superior to chlorambucil (an older standard) in terms of response rates and progression-free survival. This implies fludarabine is more active than just ""watching and waiting"" (which is, in essence, what observation is).
*   **Fludarabine Combinations:** Studies like [3, 5] demonstrate that combining fludarabine with cyclophosphamide (FC) improves outcomes compared to fludarabine alone. This suggests that fludarabine monotherapy, while active, can be improved upon, so observation would be of less value than the monotherapy.
*   **Elderly Patients:** Study [7] indicates that in elderly patients, fludarabine *may not* provide a major *survival* benefit compared to chlorambucil. This is nuanced, but suggests in some populations, the advantage of fludarabine monotherapy *over* an older treatment might be less pronounced. But this does not mean observation is a better alternative.

Given the difficulty in finding direct fludarabine vs. observation studies, and considering the historical context, a paper that could be relevant (although not a direct comparison) is:

*   Study [7]: First-line therapy with fludarabine compared with chlorambucil does not result in a major benefit for elderly patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia | Blood.

**Potentially Relevant Studies (but not a direct head-to-head comparison of *only* melphalan variations):**

Some articles suggest it's a preferred first-line regimen when combined with bevacizumab for metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer due to its balance of efficacy and safety.

*   **Comparison Studies:** Some studies compare cisplatin/paclitaxel to other cisplatin-based doublets, including cisplatin/gemcitabine.

    *   One GOG trial compared cisplatin/paclitaxel against cisplatin/vinorelbine, cisplatin/gemcitabine, and cisplatin/topotecan. The results indicated no significant differences in response rates between the arms. The trends in ORR, PFS, and OS favored paclitaxel/cisplatin as standard care
    *   Vinorelbine/cisplatin, gemcitabine/cisplatin, and topotecan/cisplatin are not superior to paclitaxel/cisplatin in terms of OS.

*   **Gemcitabine in Combination with Radiation:** Gemcitabine is also investigated in combination with cisplatin and radiation therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer. Some studies suggest improved outcomes with the addition of gemcitabine to cisplatin and radiation, while others highlight the challenges of increased toxicity.

*   **Challenges in Direct Comparison:** It seems a clear-cut study directly comparing *only* cisplatin/paclitaxel vs. cisplatin/gemcitabine as *systemic therapy alone* (without radiation) for cervical cancer is not explicitly identified in the search results.

To find the ""best"" paper for your needs, I recommend:

1.  **Refining your search:** Use more specific keywords in PubMed, such as ""cisplatin paclitaxel gemcitabine cervical cancer randomized trial"" to find studies that directly compare these regimens.
2.  **Looking at meta-analyses or reviews:** Search for systematic reviews or meta-analyses that combine the results of multiple studies. These can provide a more comprehensive overview of the evidence.
3.  **Consider the context:** Are you interested in:
    *   First-line treatment for advanced/metastatic disease?
    *   Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery?
    *   Chemoradiation regimens?

Once you clarify the specific context, you can better evaluate the available literature.

Because I can't give you a single ""pmid"" with the information available, I recommend you follow the steps above to refine your search.

*   **Cisplatin vs. Carboplatin + 5-Fluorouracil:** A retrospective analysis ([2], [7]) comparing carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (carbo-5FU) to cisplatin found that the cisplatin cohort had a higher chemotherapy completion rate and a better 3-year overall survival (OS). However, after adjusting for other factors, chemotherapy regimen was not independently associated with OS.

*   **Cetuximab vs. 5-Fluorouracil/Carboplatin vs. Cisplatin:** One study ([3], [6]) compared cetuximab, 5FU/carboplatin, and cisplatin with IMRT. It found that cetuximab was associated with inferior overall survival and locoregional control compared to cisplatin. Late toxicity was highest with 5FU/carboplatin. The study concluded that there was no significant difference between 5FU/carboplatin and high-dose cisplatin

*   **Carboplatin Alone:** One article ([1]) mentions that ""randomized trials have demonstrated that chemoradiation with carboplatin plus 5-FU was superior to radiotherapy alone in patients with head-and-neck cancer"". However, it also indicates in one trial that carboplatin-based chemoradiation was superior to radiotherapy alone but inferior to cisplatin-based treatment with respect to time to progression and median OS

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Observation compared to Emicizumab monotherapy when used to treat Inherited coagulopathy.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",30157389,"Based on the search results, it's difficult to pinpoint a single paper that *perfectly* describes the efficacy of observation compared to emicizumab monotherapy in inherited coagulopathy. This is because emicizumab is a relatively new treatment, and direct comparisons to observation alone may not be widely studied due to ethical considerations (withholding treatment). However, here's a breakdown of relevant information and potential options:

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Ethical Issues:** It's often *unethical* to leave patients with severe bleeding disorders on observation only when effective treatments like emicizumab are available. Therefore, studies directly comparing the two are scarce.
*   **Emicizumab's Efficacy:** The search results overwhelmingly highlight the *superior efficacy* of emicizumab in reducing bleeding rates compared to previous treatments (like bypassing agents) or, implicitly, to observation (where bleeding events would be expected to be much higher).
*   **Focus on Hemophilia A:** Many studies focus specifically on hemophilia A, where emicizumab is approved. Inherited coagulopathies are broader, but hemophilia A is a significant subset.
*   **No head-to-head studies**: I am unable to provide a single study that compares observation versus Emicizumab.

Given these limitations, I can offer a few options:

**Option 1 (Focus on Emicizumab's Impact):**

*   You could consider studies demonstrating the significant reduction in bleeding rates with emicizumab compared to *historical* bleeding rates *before* emicizumab was available. This implicitly shows the benefit of emicizumab over observation.
*   For example, the study in Taiwan ([9] in the search results) ""Efficacy, safety and cost of emicizumab prophylaxis in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors: A nationwide observational study in Taiwan"" shows a significant reduction in bleeding rates after emicizumab prophylaxis.

**In summary:** While a direct comparison study is unlikely to exist, you can build a case for emicizumab's superiority over observation by looking at studies that demonstrate its significant impact on reducing bleeding rates in inherited coagulopathies like hemophilia A.

I am unable to provide a pubmed ID because there is no study that compares observation versus Emicizumab.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",28379796,"Based on the information from the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint one single paper with a PubMed ID that *perfectly* encapsulates the efficacy comparison you're asking about, especially head-to-head. However, here's a breakdown of relevant studies and why a specific PMID is difficult to provide:

**Key Findings & Studies**

*   **Melphalan + ASCT vs. RVD Alone:** Some studies (like Attal et al. [52] mentioned in source \[5]) show that RVD plus ASCT results in longer progression-free survival (PFS) than RVD alone, *but* overall survival (OS) may not differ significantly. The DETERMINATION and IFM 2009 trials (source \[2]) also demonstrated improved PFS with RVD + ASCT but no OS benefit after longer follow-up.
*   **RVD vs. Rd:** The SWOG S0777 study (mentioned in source \[1]) compared RVD to Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone). RVD led to higher response rates and improved overall survival.
*   **Melphalan + ASCT vs. other regimens:** Palumbo et al. [55] (source \[5]) compared melphalan 200 mg and ASCT with melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide (MPR), with results favoring melphalan and ASCT for both PFS and OS.
*   **Quadruplet Therapy:** Newer research focuses on adding a fourth drug to RVD (e.g., daratumumab) and comparing that to RVD + ASCT (GRIFFIN study, source \[1, 6]).
*   **Meta-analyses:** Some meta-analyses (source \[1]) suggest that early vs. delayed ASCT doesn't impact OS. Others find no OS benefit with transplant-containing strategies vs. standard-dose therapy like RVD, despite PFS advantages.

**Why a Single PMID is Difficult**

1.  **Evolving Landscape:** Multiple myeloma treatment is rapidly evolving. Older studies might focus on melphalan-based regimens, while newer ones emphasize novel agents like RVD and quadruplet therapies.
2.  **Study Design Variations:** Studies vary in their specific comparisons, patient populations, induction regimens, and maintenance strategies, making direct comparisons challenging.
3.  **Focus on PFS vs. OS:** Many studies show a PFS benefit for certain approaches (like ASCT), but not always an OS benefit. This is a critical distinction.
4.  **Indirect Comparisons:** Much of the evidence is *indirect*, comparing different regimens to a common comparator (like Rd or VMP).

**Therefore, I can't provide a single ""best"" PMID.** It depends on exactly *what* comparison you're most interested in and what outcomes are most important to you (PFS, OS, MRD negativity, etc.). I can suggest reviewing the studies cited within the search results, particularly the Attal et al. [51, 52] and Palumbo et al. [55] papers mentioned in source \[5] as a starting point, keeping in mind the publication dates and the context of treatment options available at the time. Also consider looking at the GRIFFIN study for more recent data on quadruplet therapy vs. RVD.

Bevacizumab appears to be more effective when used in combination with other anticancer agents.
*   **Capecitabine and Bevacizumab Combination:** Several studies (search results 1, 3, 4) examine the combination of capecitabine and bevacizumab. These studies generally show improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) compared to capecitabine alone.
*   **RIBBON-1 study:** Search result 1 mentions the RIBBON-1 study, which compared capecitabine alone to capecitabine plus bevacizumab. The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the combination group.
*   **Meta-analysis:** Search result 4 is a meta-analysis of bevacizumab combined with capecitabine. It concludes that the combination therapy can significantly improve the response duration period (RDP) and overall survival rate (OSR) compared to the control group.

*   **General Recommendation:** Both prednisone and dexamethasone are recommended as initial corticosteroid treatments for newly diagnosed ITP.
*   **Speed of Response:** Dexamethasone *may* lead to a more rapid platelet count response compared to prednisone.
*   **Sustained Response:** Some studies suggest dexamethasone, particularly when used with post-therapy (multiple courses or tapering), *may* improve long-term sustained response. However, other studies show no significant difference in sustained response between dexamethasone and prednisone.
*   **Adverse Events:** Some data indicates that dexamethasone may have a better safety profile (fewer side effects like Cushing's syndrome, weight gain) compared to prednisone.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Studies suggest that combining rituximab or thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) with dexamethasone may lead to better sustained responses compared to dexamethasone or prednisone monotherapy.

Given the information, the following article directly compares high-dose dexamethasone with prednisone in a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial:

However, here are a few options with different strengths, along with their PubMed IDs:

**1. A clinical trial mentioned in ""Analysis of the Curative Effect of Neoadjuvant Therapy on Pancreatic Cancer""**:

*   This paper discusses a clinical trial that evaluated gemcitabine-based NACRT (neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy). It states that, compared to upfront surgery, patients who received NACRT showed a benefit in overall survival (OS) (17.1 months vs. 13.5 months) and an increased R0 resection rate (65% vs. 31%).
*   While the PubMed ID for the *review* article is retrievable, the *clinical trial* it mentions is not explicitly cited with a PMID in this review. More searching would be needed to find the original study.

**2. ""Outcomes of neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus S-1 and radiation therapy for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer"":**

*   **PMID: 36178433**
*   While this study focuses on *borderline* resectable pancreatic cancer, it investigates neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1 (another chemotherapy drug) and could provide insights. It found that patients undergoing resection after NACRT had better overall survival than those without resection.

**3. ""Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine Plus Nab-Paclitaxel in Borderline Resectable and Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"":**

*   **PMID: 34503138**
*   This is a meta-analysis, offering a broader view of the efficacy of neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (another chemotherapy drug) in borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer. While not directly comparing to *no* neoadjuvant therapy, it provides data on resection rates, survival, and safety.

**In Summary:**

It appears difficult to provide one specific paper that directly answers your question using only the search queries provided. The available papers focus on:

*   The general benefits of neoadjuvant therapy (without a specific focus on gemcitabine + RT vs. nothing).
*   Neoadjuvant gemcitabine + RT in borderline resectable cancer (rather than resectable cancer).
*   Neoadjuvant gemcitabine + other chemotherapy drugs (rather than specifically gemcitabine + RT)

To find the ""best"" paper, it would be helpful to refine the search with more specific criteria, such as focusing on:

*   Studies with resectable pancreatic cancer specifically.
*   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly comparing neoadjuvant gemcitabine + RT to upfront surgery (no neoadjuvant therapy).

However, finding one single paper that ""best"" describes it is subjective. Here's a breakdown of relevant findings and potentially useful papers:

*   **Cetuximab Monotherapy vs. Cetuximab + Chemotherapy:**

    *   Several sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [7]) indicate that cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy (like FOLFIRI or FOLFOX) is generally more effective than cetuximab monotherapy, especially in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors.
    *   Cetuximab monotherapy can be considered in later lines of treatment or for patients who cannot tolerate more aggressive chemotherapy regimens ([1], [5]).
    *   The phase III CO.17 study ([2]) compared cetuximab + best supportive care (BSC) vs. BSC alone in patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC refractory to chemotherapy. Cetuximab significantly improved OS, PFS, and ORR compared to BSC alone, but with higher rates of adverse events.

*   **Cetuximab + mFOLFOX6:**

    *   The TAILOR trial ([9]) showed that adding cetuximab to FOLFOX-4 significantly improved PFS, OS, and ORR compared to FOLFOX-4 alone in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC.
    *   The CECOG trial ([7]) confirmed that cetuximab combined with FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI improves clinical outcomes in KRAS wild-type mCRC compared to KRAS-mutated mCRC. However, no significant difference was found between the two chemotherapy regimens (FOLFOX6 vs. FOLFIRI) when combined with cetuximab.

*   **KRAS/RAS Status:**

    *   It's consistently highlighted that the efficacy of cetuximab (both as monotherapy and in combination) is strongly dependent on the KRAS/RAS status of the tumor ([1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7]). Cetuximab is most effective in patients with wild-type KRAS/RAS tumors.

Given this information, here are some potentially relevant papers and their PubMed IDs (if available):

1.  **Cunningham, D. et al. (2004). Cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. *N. Engl. J. Med.*, *351*(4), 337–345.**  This paper (referenced in multiple search results like [1] and [6]) directly compares cetuximab monotherapy to cetuximab plus irinotecan.  The Google search results mention its PMID but it's best to verify using another source.

Oncol.*, *25*, 1346–1355.** While this study examines panitumumab (another EGFR inhibitor) with FOLFOX, it provides a relevant comparison to a chemotherapy-only regimen. The Google search results mention its PMID but it's best to verify using another source.

1.  **PMID: 25559808** This paper, ""Effectiveness of androgen-deprivation therapy and radiotherapy for older men with locally advanced prostate cancer,"" examines whether the survival advantage of ADT plus RT relative to ADT alone, reported in randomized trials, holds in real-world clinical practice. The study uses SEER-Medicare data to compare ADT plus RT versus ADT alone in different patient cohorts. The findings suggest that older men with locally advanced or screen-detected high-risk prostate cancer who receive ADT alone risk decrements in cause-specific and overall survival.

2.  Based on the information I have, the study with **PMID: 25691677** provides strong evidence for the efficacy of ADT+RT compared to ADT alone. This study is the final report of the NCIC/MRC trial, a randomized trial comparing ADT plus RT vs. ADT alone for locally advanced non-metastatic prostate cancer. The results confirm substantial improvements in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and biochemical recurrence with the addition of RT to ADT.

This could be a useful point of comparison if you are considering ""no induction.""
*   **PMID: 20177072**: This study assesses the efficacy and tolerability of bortezomib with or without dexamethasone in AL amyloidosis.

While none of these directly address ""no induction"" vs. Vd, they provide efficacy data on Vd and other bortezomib-containing regimens that could be helpful in your analysis. You might need to look for studies where a ""watch and wait"" approach (which could be considered similar to ""no induction"" in some contexts) was used as a comparator, though this is less common in AL amyloidosis due to the need for prompt treatment.

**1. Bortezomib monotherapy vs. Dexamethasone (Relevant Comparator):**

*   A systematic review in PMC (PubMed Central) noted that bortezomib monotherapy was better than dexamethasone alone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (HR: 0.77; p = 0.027). Unfortunately, the tool search results do not provide the specific PMID of this review. However, the search results point to PMC, which is a free archive, and you can search there using the terms ""Bortezomib in multiple myeloma: systematic review and clinical considerations"".

**2. Bortezomib plus Dexamethasone vs. Bortezomib Monotherapy:**

*   A study in *Haematologica* compared bortezomib plus dexamethasone to bortezomib monotherapy in relapsed multiple myeloma. While not a direct comparison to *observation*, it provides insight into the efficacy of bortezomib alone. The study found a higher overall response rate with the combination (75% vs. 41%) and longer time-to-progression with the combination. The PMID for this article is not available in the search results. However, the search results point to the journal, and you can search there using the terms ""Retrospective matched-pairs analysis of bortezomib plus dexamethasone versus bortezomib monotherapy in relapsed multiple myeloma"".

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Observation Alone:** Finding a study that *directly* compares bortezomib monotherapy to *observation only* might be challenging. In many cases, observation is not the standard of care, especially in symptomatic multiple myeloma.
*   **Relapsed/Refractory vs. Newly Diagnosed:** The efficacy of bortezomib can vary depending on whether the patient has relapsed/refractory disease or is newly diagnosed.
*   **Combination Therapy:** Bortezomib is often used in combination with other drugs (e.g., lenalidomide, dexamethasone). Studies of combination regimens are more common than studies of bortezomib monotherapy.

To give you the *most* relevant PMID, please clarify:

*   Are you interested in newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma?
*   Are you specifically looking for a comparison to *observation only*, or are other comparators (like dexamethasone) acceptable?

It investigated niraparib as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. Results showed significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) with niraparib compared to placebo, regardless of HRD status.

*   **NOVA and NORA Trials:** These trials studied niraparib in recurrent ovarian cancer. They demonstrated that niraparib significantly improved PFS compared to placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease.

*   **QUADRA Study:** This single-arm, phase 2 study evaluated niraparib monotherapy in heavily pretreated (fourth-line or later) ovarian cancer. It showed clinically relevant activity, especially in patients with HRD-positive platinum-sensitive disease.

*   **PRIME Trial:** This Phase 3 trial demonstrated the efficacy of niraparib versus placebo in newly diagnosed Chinese OC patients after first-line chemotherapy.

**The ""Best"" Descriptor**

Given the prominence and broad impact, the **PRIMA/ENGOT-OV26/GOG-3012 trial** likely provides the best overall description of niraparib's efficacy compared to placebo. It's a large, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study that demonstrated a significant benefit in PFS in a first-line maintenance setting, regardless of biomarker status.

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of UFT monotherapy compared to Observation when used to treat Rectal cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",20490797,"Based on the search results, identifying a single paper that *directly* compares UFT monotherapy to observation in rectal cancer and provides a definitive PubMed ID is difficult. Several sources discuss UFT in the context of rectal cancer, but they often involve combination therapies or compare UFT to other chemotherapy regimens, rather than a direct comparison to observation alone.

Here's a breakdown of what the search found and how to interpret it:

*   **UFT's Role:** UFT (tegafur-uracil) is an oral fluoropyrimidine that has been used in the treatment of rectal cancer. Some studies suggest it's a reasonable alternative to intravenous 5-FU.

*   **Combination Therapy:** Many studies evaluate UFT in combination with radiation therapy or other chemotherapy agents. This makes it difficult to isolate the effect of UFT monotherapy versus observation.

*   **Adjuvant Setting:** Some articles mention UFT in the adjuvant setting (after surgery), but often in comparison to other chemotherapy options, not observation.

*   **Lack of Direct Comparison:** The search results don't readily show a study that *directly* randomizes rectal cancer patients to either UFT monotherapy or observation following surgery (which would be the ideal comparison).

**Possible Relevant Paper (But Not a Direct Comparison):**

The paper with PubMed ID **PMID: 18381370** discusses UFT in rectal cancer. While it doesn't directly compare UFT monotherapy to observation, it does mention that ""adjuvant UFT improved survival and reduced distant relapse compared with surgery alone."" This implies a comparison to a scenario *without* adjuvant treatment, which could be considered a form of observation.

**Therefore, the closest answer I can provide based on the search is:**

pmid18381370

**Important Considerations:**

*   This paper is a review article, meaning it summarizes existing studies. The original studies cited within this review might contain more direct comparisons, but those would need to be investigated individually.
*   The lack of a clear study directly comparing UFT monotherapy to observation highlights the complexities of cancer treatment research. Ethical considerations often make it difficult to have a true ""observation only"" arm in studies where treatment options exist.

However, directly comparing UFT monotherapy to observation alone is less common in the studies provided. Here's a breakdown of relevant findings and potential studies to investigate further:

*   **UFT Compared to S-1:** Some studies ([5], [7]) compare UFT to S-1 monotherapy as adjuvant treatments after gastrectomy. These suggest comparable outcomes between UFT and S-1.
*   **UFT in Combination Therapy:** Several sources ([1], [3]) discuss UFT's role in combination chemotherapy regimens for gastric cancer.

While a direct comparison of UFT monotherapy *versus* observation may not be explicitly present in the provided snippets, the following article comes the closest to addressing your query:

*   **""Maintenance treatment of Uracil and Tegafur (UFT) in responders following first-line fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in metastatic gastric cancer: a randomized phase II study""** ([6])

    *   This study compares UFT maintenance therapy to observation in patients who responded to initial chemotherapy. While not a first-line monotherapy vs. observation study, it does provide data on UFT versus observation in a relevant patient population.

    *   Fludarabine monotherapy has shown effectiveness in Follicular Lymphoma (FL), but complete response rates in MCL are not as impressive.
    *   It is more effective in combination with other agents like anthracyclines, alkylating agents, or rituximab.

    *   Temsirolimus has also been tested in combination with rituximab.
*   **Ibrutinib vs. Temsirolimus:**
    *   One study (Rule S, et al.) directly compared ibrutinib and temsirolimus in relapsed/refractory MCL. Ibrutinib showed significantly better ORR and PFS.

1.  **REVEL Trial:** The phase 3 REVEL trial ([8]) compared ramucirumab plus docetaxel to placebo plus docetaxel as a second-line treatment for stage IV NSCLC after platinum-based therapy. It showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR) with the combination therapy. Specifically, median OS was 10.5 months for the ramucirumab plus docetaxel group and 9.1 months for the placebo plus docetaxel group (HR 0.86, p=0.023). Median PFS was 4.5 months vs. 3.0 months, respectively (HR 0.76, p<0.0001).

2.  **Systematic Literature Review:** A systematic review ([4], [7]) analyzing clinical outcomes of ramucirumab plus docetaxel in NSCLC patients after immunotherapy reported a median OS of 19.8 months in the ramucirumab plus docetaxel group versus 8.6 months in the docetaxel monotherapy group in one study. It also noted a significant PFS improvement with the combination. However, it also highlights the lack of randomized controlled clinical studies focusing on ramucirumab plus docetaxel after prior ICI treatment.

3.  **EVOKE-01 Study:** While not directly comparing docetaxel monotherapy to docetaxel and ramucirumab, the EVOKE-01 study ([1]) uses docetaxel monotherapy as a comparator arm when studying sacituzumab govitecan versus docetaxel in previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC. It notes that docetaxel with or without nintedanib/ramucirumab has been investigated in this setting, but both are associated with modest efficacy and significant AEs affecting patient QoL. The study indicates that docetaxel monotherapy is a globally accepted comparator for NSCLC studies in this setting due to the modest OS improvement from the addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel seen in the REVEL trial.

Given the above information, the **REVEL trial** ([8]) appears to be the most relevant pivotal study directly comparing docetaxel monotherapy to docetaxel plus ramucirumab in the second-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC.

**2. NEJM Journal Watch report on Subcutaneous Rituximab:**

*   This ([6]) summarizes a study comparing subcutaneous rituximab to IV rituximab *monotherapy* in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma with low tumor burden.

**1. Comparing CMF to other regimens:**

*   **CMF vs. Anthracycline-based Regimens:** An Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis suggested a slight advantage for anthracycline-containing regimens over CMF in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
*   **CMF vs. AC-T:** A systematic review and network meta-analysis found that CMF was associated with significantly worse overall survival (OS) compared to sequential anthracycline-cyclophosphamide and taxane (AC-T).
*   **CMF vs. E-CMF:** Several studies compared CMF to E-CMF (epirubicin followed by CMF). Longer follow-up confirmed that E-CMF was significantly superior to CMF for relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). (PMID: 17339755)

**2. CMF and Radiotherapy (RT):**

*   **Concurrent CMF and RT:**
    *   A pilot study of concurrent CMF and RT showed acceptable toxicity and outcomes, warranting further comparison to alternative sequences. (PMID: 9089838)
    *   Another study found that whole-breast RT and concurrent CMF are a safe adjuvant treatment in terms of toxicity. However, there was a slightly higher rate of Grade 2 acute skin toxicity in the concurrent group. (PMID: 18595919)
*   **Sequencing of CMF and RT:**
    *   One review mentions that adjuvant chemotherapy (A-CT) has typically preceded adjuvant radiotherapy (A-RT) in breast cancer treatment. The review analyzes studies assessing different sequencing strategies, including sequential, concomitant, and sandwich modalities.

**3. CMF Effectiveness in Specific Subgroups:**

*   A study on node-negative, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) found that adjuvant CMF reduced the locoregional recurrence rate and prolonged DFS in patients with tumors greater than 2 cm or who had undergone partial mastectomy.

*   **Dactinomycin and Vincristine as Baseline:** Dactinomycin and vincristine are often the base chemotherapy for Wilms tumor, especially in earlier stage tumors (source \[1]).
*   **Adding More Chemotherapy:** For more advanced or high-risk Wilms tumor, other drugs are added to this base, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (source \[1, 4]). So, the question becomes whether *adding* more drugs or extending the duration of treatment improves outcomes in specific situations.
*   **""Prolonged"" Chemotherapy and Neoadjuvant Treatment:** Some sources discuss the duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery). Source \[3] mentions a study finding that prolonged periods of neoadjuvant chemotherapy didn't necessarily confer additional benefits.
*   **NWTS-5 Study:** Source \[6] discusses a study of infants with very low-risk Wilms tumor treated with surgery alone versus surgery followed by vincristine and dactinomycin (referred to as ""EE4A"").

*   **Stroke Prevention:** Transfusions have a well-established role in primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia and abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) results. The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) demonstrated a significant reduction in overt strokes through chronic blood transfusions.

*   **Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS):** While some studies show a decrease in ACS rates with transfusion, others indicate similar rates between hydroxyurea and transfusion. Hydroxyurea is often recommended as initial therapy for ACS.
*   **Pain Management:** A pilot trial didn't show significant improvement in hospital stay or opiate use with early transfusion for acute pain.
*   **Preoperative Management:** The Transfusion Alternatives Preoperatively in Sickle Cell Disease (TAPS) study indicated reduced complications with prophylactic transfusions before low- to medium-risk surgeries.
*   **General Considerations:** Transfusions reduce the burden of sickled cells, improving oxygen-carrying capacity. However, they also carry risks like alloimmunization and iron overload.

**Relevant Publications:**

*   **STOP Trial:** Established the importance of TCD screening and prophylactic transfusions for stroke prevention.
*   **TCD With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea Trial:** Showed the efficacy of hydroxyurea as an alternative to transfusions for stroke prevention.
*   **Transfusion Alternatives Preoperatively in Sickle Cell Disease (TAPS) study:** Assessed the benefits of prophylactic preoperative transfusion.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",29395502,"Based on the search results, identifying a single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of docetaxel monotherapy compared to observation for prostate cancer is challenging. Here's why and what I can offer:

*   **Docetaxel is generally used in combination:** The current standard of care typically involves docetaxel in combination with other therapies, particularly androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), rather than as a monotherapy, especially in metastatic settings.
*   **Evolution of treatment:** Newer hormonal agents (NHAs) are also now frequently used in combination with ADT.
*   **Lack of direct comparisons:** Head-to-head trials directly comparing docetaxel monotherapy to observation alone are scarce in recent literature, likely because observation alone would not be a typical approach in situations where docetaxel is considered.
*   **Monotherapy studies focus on other aspects:** Some studies explore docetaxel monotherapy in specific contexts, such as after failure of other treatments or in combination with novel agents to overcome resistance.

While a definitive ""best"" paper is elusive for the specific comparison you requested, here are some relevant findings and potentially useful articles based on the search:

*   **Docetaxel vs. NHAs:** One study (PMID not available from the search snippets, but the article is: Real-world comparison of Docetaxel versus new hormonal agents in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer descrying PSA Nadir ≤ 0.05 ng/ml as marker for treatment response) compared docetaxel + ADT to NHAs + ADT. While not a comparison to observation, it provides real-world data on docetaxel's effectiveness relative to another standard treatment. The study suggests a trend toward higher benefit with NHAs as first-line treatment in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.
*   **Combination therapies vs. ADT monotherapy:** Several sources emphasize that combination therapies (including docetaxel + ADT) are superior to ADT monotherapy. This indirectly suggests that docetaxel has a benefit over observation alone (since observation would likely be less effective than ADT alone).
*   **DKN-01 with or without Docetaxel:** A phase 1/2 trial (DOI: 10.1038/s41391-024-00798-z) investigates DKN-01 as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

**Papers directly comparing ABVD (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) +/- Radiation:**

*   **ABVD Alone versus Radiation-Based Therapy in Limited Stage Hodgkin's Lymphoma:** This study (if you can access the full text via PubMed) directly compares ABVD alone to treatment including radiation therapy in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.
*   Several sources mention trials where ABVD followed by radiation therapy was a standard approach, and some studies explored reduced radiation doses or omitting radiation based on PET scan results.

**Papers on Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine (AVD) regimens:**

*   Some studies explore AVD (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine) with or without Brentuximab vedotin, sometimes followed by radiation, as a strategy to reduce bleomycin-related lung toxicity. These might be relevant if you're interested in bleomycin-sparing regimens.

**Other Relevant Information:**

*   **Combined Modality Therapy:** Many sources emphasize that combined modality therapy (chemotherapy like ABVD *plus* radiation) has been a standard approach. The goal has been to maintain efficacy while reducing long-term toxicities by optimizing the chemotherapy regimen and radiation dose/volume.
*   **Response-Adapted Therapy:** Some trials use interim PET scans to guide treatment decisions, including whether or not to administer radiation therapy.
*   **BEACOPP vs. ABVD:** Some studies compare BEACOPP (a more intensive chemotherapy regimen) to ABVD, with radiation therapy sometimes used in both arms based on disease bulk or residual disease after chemotherapy.

To give you a specific PubMed ID, I'd need more information about what aspect of the comparison you're most interested in (e.g., early vs. advanced stage, specific chemotherapy regimen, bleomycin-sparing approaches, or response-adapted therapy). You can then use the information above to search PubMed for the most relevant paper.

Here's why and what can be gleaned from the results:

*   **Observation vs. Active Treatment:** Many studies focus on comparing different *active* treatments (like TAC vs. other chemotherapy regimens) rather than comparing an active treatment (like TAC) to *observation* alone. Observation is typically considered when the risk of recurrence is deemed low enough that the potential benefits of treatment might not outweigh the risks/side effects.
*   **Context is Key:** The decision to use observation versus TAC depends heavily on the specific characteristics of the breast cancer (stage, grade, hormone receptor status, HER2 status), as well as patient-specific factors.
*   **Indirect Comparisons:** Some of the search results provide information that *could* be used to indirectly inform a decision about observation vs. TAC in specific situations:

    *   **PDQ Summary (Result 1):** This comprehensive summary from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) discusses breast cancer treatment options and outcomes. It won't give you a single study ID, but it's a good starting point to understand the factors that go into treatment decisions. The PDQ summary mentions studies of trastuzumab vs observation, which highlights that observation *is* a relevant comparator in some contexts, particularly for HER2+ breast cancer.
    *   **NATT Study (Result 2):** This study compares TAC to TC (docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide) in neoadjuvant treatment of triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer. While it doesn't directly compare to observation, it provides evidence about the efficacy of TAC in specific subtypes of breast cancer, which would be relevant when considering if the potential benefit of TAC warrants its use over observation.

Given the difficulty of finding a direct comparison study, I recommend exploring the NCI's PDQ summary (result 1) to understand the factors that influence treatment decisions and whether observation might be a reasonable approach in certain low-risk scenarios.

*   **Observation vs. Early Treatment:** Several sources ([1], [3], [8]) indicate that observation is appropriate for asymptomatic patients with low tumor burden and no cytopenias. Early treatment with chemotherapy or single-agent rituximab does not show an overall survival advantage in these cases.

*   **R-CVP vs. Observation after localized treatment**: Study \[12] suggests that after radiation therapy for localized disease, adding systemic treatment (CVP or R-CVP) improved 10-year progression-free survival, but this is in the context of *adjuvant* therapy *after* radiation.

*   **R-CVP Compared to Other Regimens**:
    *   FOLL05 trial ([4], [16]) compared R-CVP to R-CHOP and R-FM. While it showed similar overall survival among the arms, R-CHOP and R-FM had superior time to treatment failure compared to R-CVP. Patients initially treated with R-CVP had a higher risk of lymphoma progression.
    *   A meta-analysis ([15]) suggested that R-CVP might achieve higher complete response rates in first-line therapy compared to R-CHOP.

*   **Obinutuzumab-based regimens**: One retrospective study ([5]) suggests O-CVP (Obinutuzumab-CVP) showed superior efficacy and survival compared to R-CVP in previously untreated elderly patients with advanced FL.

**Potentially Relevant Papers**

Given the prompt's focus on *observation* compared to *CVP*, here are two possible papers, keeping in mind that the most direct comparisons might be in the context of maintenance therapy or specific patient subgroups:

1.  **""Follicular lymphoma in the modern era: survival, treatment outcomes, and identification of high-risk subgroups"" (PMID: 32678074)** This study ([2]) mentions observation and subsequent treatment, and relates FLIPI score increases after observation to inferior survival following first-line treatment. This may provide some insight into the efficacy of observation as an initial strategy and factors influencing outcomes.
2.  **""Is watch and wait still acceptable for patients with low-grade follicular lymphoma?""** This article ([8]) directly addresses the watch-and-wait approach, providing data on time to treatment initiation, freedom from treatment failure, and overall survival in patients initially managed with observation.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",22364685,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of observation compared to Defibrotide monotherapy for hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). The reason is that many studies focus on the efficacy of Defibrotide *versus* historical controls or best available therapy, rather than a direct comparison to observation alone.

However, here's a breakdown of relevant papers and why they might be useful, along with their PubMed IDs where available:

**Papers discussing Defibrotide efficacy:**

*   **Richardson PG, et al. Blood. 2016;127(13):1656-1665. (PMID: 26825712)** This is a Phase 3 trial of Defibrotide for severe VOD and multi-organ failure, which would have compared Defibrotide to a control arm (often best available treatment), giving some insight indirectly into the effect of observation.
*   **Semin Thromb Hemost. 2019 Nov;45(8):767-777. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-1698763.** This is a meta-analysis that looks at the efficacy and safety of Defibrotide for VOD post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
*   Some sources mention that Defibrotide, in a phase 3 trial, had superior 100-day survival compared to best available treatments/conservative management.

**Why a direct comparison is difficult:**

*   ""Best available treatment"" in the control arms of these studies often includes supportive care. True ""observation only"" would likely be reserved for very mild cases, making a comparison difficult.
*   Ethically, it can be challenging to have a true ""observation only"" arm in severe VOD studies, given the high mortality rate.

Therefore, while I can't provide a single PMID for a paper *directly* comparing observation to Defibrotide, the PMID listed above (26825712) and the meta-analysis are good starting points for understanding Defibrotide's efficacy in VOD, which can be indirectly compared to the expected outcome with supportive care/observation alone.

*   **VOLFI Trial:** This phase 2 trial showed that modified FOLFOXIRI plus panitumumab was associated with a higher objective response rate (ORR) than FOLFOXIRI alone in patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type mCRC.

*   **Meta-analysis:** A meta-analysis examining triplet chemotherapy plus anti-EGFR agents (including panitumumab) showed a pooled ORR of 82% and a pooled R0 resection rate of 59% for colorectal liver metastases.

*   **Propensity Score-Based Analysis:** One study comparing FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab to FOLFOX + panitumumab found no significant differences in progression-free survival or overall survival between the two groups.

*   **TRICE trial:** This trial found that in RAS/BRAF wild-type CRC patients with initially unresectable CRLM, the objective response rates (ORRs) were comparable between cetuximab plus FOLFOXIRI versus cetuximab plus FOLFOX .

Given the conflicting information and the complexity of the topic, it's difficult to pinpoint one single ""best"" paper. However, the TRIPLETE study is a phase 3 trial directly comparing mFOLFOXIRI + panitumumab to a relevant comparator (mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab) and provides a clear conclusion of no added benefit with the triplet regimen in that context.

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Placebo compared to Aspirin monotherapy when used to treat Venous thromboembolism.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",22621626,"Based on the search results, identifying a single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of placebo compared to aspirin monotherapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is challenging. The studies found often compare aspirin to other anticoagulants or dual therapies, rather than directly comparing aspirin to placebo in VTE treatment.

However, I can offer some relevant information and potential leads:

*   **Aspirin vs. Other Anticoagulants:** Several studies (like the meta-analysis with PMID: 37861503) compare aspirin to other anticoagulants for VTE prevention, particularly in orthopedic surgery. These studies generally find aspirin to be less effective than other anticoagulants in preventing VTE.
*   **Aspirin Monotherapy:** One article mentions that aspirin monotherapy is associated with a 32% relative risk reduction in VTE recurrence compared to no treatment or placebo. However, it also notes that it is less effective than anticoagulation.
*   **Rivaroxaban vs. Aspirin:** One study compared rivaroxaban with aspirin for extended VTE treatment, finding a lower risk of recurrent events with rivaroxaban.

To find a paper that *directly* compares aspirin monotherapy to placebo for VTE treatment, I would suggest the following search strategy on PubMed:

1.  Search for ""aspirin"" AND ""placebo"" AND ""venous thromboembolism"" AND ""randomized controlled trial"".
2.  Carefully review the abstracts of the search results to identify studies that meet your specific criteria (aspirin monotherapy vs. placebo).

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",28682681,"Based on the search results, several studies discuss the efficacy of T-DM1 compared to Trastuzumab in treating breast cancer. Here are a few options, focusing on studies that directly compare T-DM1 to Trastuzumab-based regimens:

1.  **Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC): a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial:** This meta-analysis (source [3]) evaluates the efficacy and safety of T-DM1 compared to other anti-HER2 therapies, including trastuzumab-based regimens, for HER2-positive breast cancer. It concludes that T-DM1 significantly prolonged PFS and OS. While it doesn't focus specifically on the ET combination, it provides a broader comparison.

2.  **Efficacy and Safety of Pyrotinib Versus T-DM1 in HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Pre-Treated With Trastuzumab and a Taxane: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis** (Source [2]): This study compares T-DM1 to other therapies, including Trastuzumab combinations, in patients pre-treated with Trastuzumab.

3.  **Combining Endocrine Therapy with Trastuzumab Emtansine Improves Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival in HER2-Positive, Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (Source [7])**: This study directly compares T-DM1 in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) to T-DM1 alone. It demonstrates that the combination significantly improves PFS and OS in HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive MBC.

To best answer your request, focusing on T-DM1 and ET compared to Trastuzumab and ET, I recommend looking into source [7] further, as it directly addresses the efficacy of T-DM1 + ET versus T-DM1 alone and finds a significant improvement in PFS and OS with the combination therapy. While it does not directly compare to Trastuzumab + ET, this information can potentially be extrapolated from the results presented in the paper.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",27614621,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of ADT and zoledronic acid compared to ADT alone for prostate cancer. However, here's a breakdown of relevant studies and how to potentially find the most suitable one, along with a potential PMID:

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Specific Patient Population:** Are you interested in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)? Some studies focus on earlier stages, while others look at later stages where ADT is no longer fully effective. Also, is the patient population metastatic or non-metastatic?
*   **Outcomes of Interest:** Are you most concerned with overall survival (OS), time to castration resistance, bone mineral density (BMD), skeletal-related events (SREs), or pain management?
*   **Study Design:** Was the study a randomized controlled trial (RCT), a meta-analysis, or an observational study? RCTs generally provide stronger evidence.

**Relevant Studies and Findings (from the search results):**

*   **Zoledronic acid + ADT may prolong time to castration-resistant prostate cancer:** One study suggests that the combination *may* be better than ADT alone, particularly in patients with lower baseline PSA or Gleason score (from search result 1).
*   **STAMPEDE Trial:** This large trial investigated ADT + zoledronic acid, among other combinations. The search results indicate that zoledronic acid did *not* provide an overall survival benefit or improvement in SREs when added to ADT in men with bone-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (search result 2).
*   **Bisphosphonates and SREs:** Zoledronic acid is used to manage bone metastasis in prostate cancer and may prolong the time to SREs and alleviate bone pain. However, its effectiveness varies across studies (search result 3).
*   **Zoledronic acid for mCRPC:** Zoledronic acid is an established treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (search result 7).
*   **Zoledronic acid and BMD:** Zoledronic acid can improve BMD in men on ADT who have osteopenia or osteoporosis (search result 9).

**How to Find the ""Best"" Paper:**

1.  **Define your specific question:** Be as precise as possible about the patient population, outcomes, and study design you're interested in.
2.  **Refine your PubMed search:** Use more specific keywords based on your defined question. For example:
    *   `""prostate cancer"" AND ""androgen deprivation therapy"" AND ""zoledronic acid"" AND ""overall survival"" AND ""randomized controlled trial""`
    *   `""metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer"" AND ""ADT"" AND ""zoledronic acid"" AND ""skeletal-related events""`
3.  **Critically evaluate the results:** Look for studies with large sample sizes, rigorous methodology, and results that are directly relevant to your question.

**Potential Relevant PMID:**

Given the information available, and erring on the side of a negative finding (since several sources suggest zoledronic acid doesn't add significant benefit in many scenarios when combined with ADT *vs.* ADT alone), you might find the STAMPEDE trial results relevant. You would need to search PubMed directly for the STAMPEDE trial publication focusing on the zoledronic acid arm to get the specific PMID. A search for `STAMPEDE trial zoledronic acid prostate cancer` on PubMed should help you locate the relevant publication and its PMID.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a specific PMID without further refinement of your requirements and a more precise search.**

The study concluded that both regimens had comparable efficacy, but IP had less hematologic toxicity and more gastrointestinal toxicity.
    *   This study is published as: ""Phase III trial of irinotecan/cisplatin compared with etoposide/cisplatin in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: clinical and pharmacogenomic results from SWOG S0124"" with several publications. One of them is in PubMed.
