- **Arm I**: Patients receive Rituximab intravenously on day 1 of cycle 1, followed by Rituximab and hyaluronidase subcutaneously on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, and then subcutaneously on day 1 of subsequent cycles.

- **Arm II**: Patients receive Mosunetuzumab subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, and on day 1 of subsequent cycles.

The primary objective is to compare the 3-year progression-free survival probabilities between the two treatment arms. ([ichgcp.net](https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT06337318?utm_source=openai)) ",NCT06337318,False,
