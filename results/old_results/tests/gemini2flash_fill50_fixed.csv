Many regimens for TB include **Isoniazid**.
Other potential ingredients starting with ""I"" could include:
*   **Itraconazole**
*   **Isepamicin**

However, Isoniazid is the most likely ingredient starting with ""I"" found in a TB treatment regimen.

**2. FDA Exclusivity for Isoniazid (approved before Dec 2024):**

Determining the *exact* exclusivity date for Isoniazid is difficult, as it is an older drug. Here's why:

*   **Isoniazid is not a New Chemical Entity (NCE):** Since Isoniazid is not a new chemical entity and has been approved for a long time, it would not have the 5-year data exclusivity granted to new drugs.
*   **Possible 3-Year Exclusivity:** A 3-year exclusivity could have been granted if new clinical trials were required for a *change* to the drug (e.g., a new formulation or indication). However, this exclusivity would only prevent the *approval* of generic applications for that specific change for three years, not the submission.
*   **Pediatric Exclusivity:** It's *possible* that pediatric exclusivity (an extra 6 months) was granted if studies were done in children at the FDA's request.
*   **Exclusivity Expired:** Given that Isoniazid has been available for many years, any exclusivity periods related to its original approval or subsequent modifications have likely *expired*.

**1. Identifying the Regimen and the Ingredient Starting with 'I':**

Clinical trial NCT01973387 compares Ibrutinib versus Rituximab in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma. Therefore, the ingredient starting with the letter ""I"" among the more effective regimen ingredients is **Ibrutinib**.

**2. Finding Ibrutinib's Exclusivity Date:**

Ibrutinib, sold under the brand name Imbruvica, received its initial FDA approval on **February 12, 2014**, for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who had received at least one prior therapy.

However, based on the provided search results, determining a specific exclusivity date that definitively applies to *overall* FDA drug approval and extends to December 2024 is complex. Here's why:

*   **Multiple Approvals and Exclusivities:** Ibrutinib has received several FDA approvals for different indications and patient populations, each potentially having its own exclusivity period.
*   **Patent vs. Exclusivity:** Patent protection and FDA exclusivity are distinct. Patents can extend for 20 years from the filing date, while exclusivity is typically granted for a shorter period to encourage innovation.
*   **Ongoing Patent Activity:** Search result [6] suggests that Imbruvica has a complex patent landscape with patents filed even after initial approval, potentially extending commercial exclusivity through various means. The same search result suggests that initial patents on Ibrutinib cast a wide net of scientific knowledge and protection, including potential indications and formulations. This knowledge is then disaggregated and patented in phases with more specificity.
*   Search result [1] suggests that no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is currently expected prior to March 30, 2032.

Based on the orphan drug designation, Ibrutinib was designated for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) on 04/06/2012. The exclusivity end date for treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy was **02/12/2021**. The exclusivity end date for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion who have not received at least one prior therapy was **07/28/2021**. The exclusivity end date for treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia without 17p deletion who have not received at least one prior therapy (first line therapy) was **03/04/2023**.

Therefore, it's difficult to provide a single MM-DD-YYYY date that represents the *overall* exclusivity end date for Ibrutinib's initial FDA approval based on the provided information.

**Final Answer:** Due to the complexity of multiple approvals and exclusivity periods, a definitive exclusivity date that meets all the specified criteria (overall FDA approval, extends to Dec 2024) cannot be determined from the provided search results.

Here are the search queries I will use:

Okay, I have gathered some information. Let's break down the answer step-by-step.

**1. Identify the more effective regimen in clinical trial NCT00071799:**

Based on the search results, particularly \[4], \[7], \[8], \[9], and \[10], clinical trial NCT00071799 compared azacitidine to conventional care regimens for higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The results indicated that **azacitidine** demonstrated a statistically significant increase in overall survival compared to conventional care. Therefore, the more effective regimen is the one involving azacitidine.

**2. Find ingredients starting with 'A':**

From the above, the ingredient that starts with the letter ""A"" is **azacitidine**.

**3. Determine the most recent FDA approval (up to December 2024) for azacitidine:**

According to the search results, specifically \[4], an oral formulation of azacitidine/cedazuridine is under investigation (ASTX030). It also mentions that in January 2024, Guillermo Garcia-Manero, MD, spotlights the evolution of oral azacitidine- and decitabine-based regimens for MDS. I will look for FDA approvals for azacitidine and its combinations up to December 2024. I am looking for an original FDA drug approval for a company, not a new indication.

Based on search results \[7], \[8], \[9], and \[10], Azacitidine has been approved for the treatment of higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

**4. Identify the company that received the approval and check for US stock market listing:**

I need to find the pharmaceutical company that received the most recent FDA approval for azacitidine until December 2024.

Based on search result \[4], the FDA-approved oral formulation of decitabine/cedazuridine (Inqovi). It also mentions the investigational oral azacitidine/cedazuridine combination (ASTX030). The search results indicate that this is an investigational drug.

Based on the FDA website ([15] and [17]), there is no new original FDA approval for Azacitidine up to December 2024. There are new approvals for other drugs; however, I am looking for the most recent approval specifically for Azacitidine.

Therefore, I will consider the company that originally received the approval for Azacitidine. While I don't have the *absolute* most recent original approval date through December 2024, I can determine if the original company is publicly traded.

Multiple sources indicate that azacitidine is marketed under the brand name Vidaza. Based on previous knowledge, Vidaza was initially developed and marketed by Pharmion, which was acquired by Celgene. Celgene was then acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS).

Bristol Myers Squibb is a publicly traded company.

**5. Provide stock ticker and opening price:**

*   **Stock Ticker Symbol:** BMS
*   **Opening Stock Price on FDA Approval Date:** Since Bristol Myers Squibb acquired Celgene, finding the opening stock price on the original FDA approval date of azacitidine (Vidaza) would not reflect the same company. Therefore, it is not possible to give the precise opening stock price relevant to *this* company (BMS) on the original FDA approval date for azacitidine.

Therefore:

*   **Ingredient starting with ""A"":** Azacitidine
*   **Pharmaceutical Company:** Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)
*   **Stock Ticker Symbol:** BMS
*   **Opening Stock Price on FDA Approval Date:** Not Possible (company acquired after original approval).
