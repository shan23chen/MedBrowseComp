*   Several studies have compared apixaban to enoxaparin, sometimes in combination with warfarin. Apixaban has demonstrated non-inferiority (meaning it's not worse) to enoxaparin/warfarin in preventing recurrent VTE.
*   Apixaban has shown a statistically significant reduction in major bleeding compared to enoxaparin/warfarin.
*   Apixaban might reduce all-cause hospitalizations and shorten the length of hospital stays compared to enoxaparin/warfarin.

**Specific Clinical Trials and Their NCT IDs:**

*   **Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep-Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy (AMPLIFY) trial:** This trial (NCT00643201) found that apixaban was non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin in preventing recurrent VTE with significantly less bleeding. It also showed a reduction in all-cause hospitalizations.
*   **ADVANCE-1 trial:** This trial compared apixaban to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after knee replacement. While the study didn't meet the pre-defined statistical criteria for non-inferiority due to a lower-than-expected incidence of the primary efficacy outcome in the enoxaparin group, it did suggest a potential advantage of apixaban concerning bleeding.
*   **A study on women undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignant neoplasm (NCT02366871):** This study found no statistically significant differences between apixaban and enoxaparin in major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, or VTE events. It suggested apixaban is a potentially safe, less painful, and easier-to-take alternative to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after surgery for gynecologic cancer.
*   **ADVANCE-3 study:** This study showed apixaban was statistically superior to enoxaparin in reducing the incidence of VTE in patients undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery, with comparable bleeding rates.

So, based on the information I found, here are some relevant NCT IDs:

*   NCT00643201

**Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab vs. Paclitaxel Monotherapy:**

*   **Efficacy:** The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel improves outcomes compared to paclitaxel alone. The AURELIA trial showed that paclitaxel plus bevacizumab resulted in a longer median progression-free survival (mPFS) compared to chemotherapy alone. One analysis of the AURELIA trial showed the most benefit in the weekly paclitaxel cohort, with a median PFS of 10.4 months compared to 3.9 months for paclitaxel alone.
*   **Relevant Clinical Trial:** While the AURELIA trial is key, I don't have the NCT ID for it. The ALIENOR trial (NCT01770301) studied paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in relapsed ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors, but it found similar PFS in both arms.

**Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin and Bevacizumab vs. Paclitaxel Monotherapy:**

*   **Efficacy:** Bevacizumab combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) improves outcomes compared to chemotherapy alone. The AURELIA trial supports this.
*   **Relevant Clinical Trial:** Again, the main trial is AURELIA, but I don't have the NCT ID.

**Topotecan and Bevacizumab vs. Paclitaxel Monotherapy:**

*   **Efficacy:** The addition of bevacizumab to topotecan improves outcomes compared to chemotherapy alone. The AURELIA trial supports this. A study comparing topotecan vs. paclitaxel showed that topotecan had at least equivalent efficacy to paclitaxel, with a higher response rate and significantly longer time to progression.
*   **Relevant Clinical Trial:** The AURELIA trial is the primary one, but I lack the NCT ID.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **AURELIA Trial:** The AURELIA trial (Avastin Use in Platinum-Resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer) is a critical study that evaluated bevacizumab in combination with PLD, paclitaxel, or topotecan in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
*   **Platinum Resistance:** The definition of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) is progression within 6 months of the last platinum-based regimen.

**Efficacy Summary:**

*   Studies like BELLE-2 and BELLE-3 (which used NCT01633060) evaluated the combination of buparlisib plus fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone (with a placebo). These trials focused on postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer that had progressed after prior endocrine therapy and, in the case of BELLE-3, mTOR inhibitors.
*   The combination of buparlisib and fulvestrant showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to fulvestrant alone in some studies. However, the BELLE-3 trial indicated that while buparlisib plus fulvestrant did extend median progression-free survival, the safety profile did not support its further development for all patients.
*   A network meta-analysis indicated that palbociclib plus fulvestrant may be an optimal treatment option.
*   Some studies suggest the combination of targeted therapies plus fulvestrant improved PFS and objective response rate (ORR) compared to fulvestrant monotherapy, but with increased toxicities.

In conclusion, while fulvestrant monotherapy is an effective treatment, studies suggest that combination therapies with drugs like buparlisib or palbociclib can improve outcomes such as progression-free survival. However, these combinations often come with increased side effects, so the benefits and risks need to be carefully considered.

**Efficacy of Radiation Therapy vs. MOPP-ABV in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma**

*   **Early-stage Hodgkin Lymphoma:** A study (H8-F trial) compared MOPP-ABV ×3 plus Involved Field Radiotherapy (IFRT) with subtotal nodal irradiation alone (STNI). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was significantly higher after MOPP-ABV + IFRT than after STNI alone (98% vs. 74%, P<0.001). The 10-year overall survival (OS) estimates were also higher (97% vs 92%, P=0.001).
*   **Advanced Stages:** MOPP-ABV has been compared to ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). ABVD became the standard of care for advanced HL because it was less myelotoxic than MOPP or MOPP-ABVD. In patients with bulky stage 2 disease, ABVD with radiation therapy (RT) was shown to be superior to MOPP with RT.

**Radiation Therapy in Treating Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma**

*   **Early-Stage:** Extended field radiotherapy (EFRT) alone initially showed excellent results. However, combined modality therapy (CMT), including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, has become the standard to reduce late complications. Current recommendations involve 2 cycles of ABVD followed by involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) for favorable cases and 4 cycles of ABVD followed by IFRT for unfavorable cases.
*   **Advanced-Stage:** The role of radiation therapy in advanced stages has been debated. While chemotherapy became the primary treatment, radiotherapy can be beneficial in certain situations. Studies suggest that consolidation RT might improve survival in select patients with stage IV HL, particularly those who are young or without B symptoms.

**Clinical Trial ID:**

*   **The COMPASS trial:** This trial compared rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg daily, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or aspirin 100 mg daily in patients with atherosclerotic coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery disease. It found that the dual pathway inhibition (rivaroxaban plus aspirin) reduced the risk of VTE compared to aspirin alone. Rivaroxaban monotherapy did not significantly reduce VTE events compared to aspirin alone.

It appears that trials directly comparing aspirin monotherapy to rivaroxaban monotherapy for VTE treatment are less common than trials examining dual therapy (rivaroxaban + aspirin) versus aspirin alone, or comparing these options for VTE *prevention* after certain surgeries.

*   **NCT02398825:** This trial evaluated the efficacy of Ponatinib in patients with chronic phase CML who were resistant to Imatinib.
*   **NCT01746836:** This phase II trial studied how well ponatinib hydrochloride works as a second-line therapy for treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase that has not responded to initial treatment with imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, or nilotinib or cannot tolerate imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, or nilotinib.
*   **NCT02467270:** This trial studied Ponatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML who no longer benefit from or have a gene mutation marker for resistance to other kinase-inhibitor treatments.
*   **NCT04043676:** A multicenter open-label, single-arm, phase II, exploratory, prospective clinical trial that was conducted including patients with philadelphia-positive CML who met discontinuation criteria according to European LeukemiaNet recommendations, had received 4 years or more of imatinib therapy, with a documented grade 4 molecular response (MR4) at least 12 months prior to study entry.

Regarding the efficacy of Ponatinib monotherapy compared to Imatinib monotherapy, the EPIC trial (NCT01650805) was designed to assess this directly in newly diagnosed patients. However, it was terminated early, so a definitive conclusion about efficacy couldn't be reached.

*   **Low-activity vs. High-activity Radioiodine:** A systematic review and meta-analysis (2021) compared low-activity RAI to high-activity RAI in low- and intermediate-risk DTC. It found no significant difference in long-term cure recurrence rates or successful remnant ablation between the two activity levels.
    *   This suggests low-activity RAI is preferable due to similar efficacy but reduced morbidity compared to high-activity RAI, but it does not compare to observation.
*   **Low-Dose vs. High-Dose Radioiodine Ablation:** A retrospective comparative analysis (2020) found that low-dose ablation seemed to be less effective than high-dose ablation, especially in patients with positive antithyroglobulin antibodies or higher stimulated thyroglobulin levels at the moment of ablation. Low dose was associated with higher recurrence rates.

*   **ABVD as Standard:** ABVD (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine) has been a standard first-line treatment for advanced-stage Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.
*   **Omission of Bleomycin or Dacarbazine:** Studies suggest that omitting either dacarbazine or bleomycin from the ABVD regimen might reduce its efficacy.
*   **AV (Doxorubicin and Vinblastine):** In a trial investigating reduced-intensity regimens, AV was compared to ABVD. However, the overall conclusion was that the standard of care should remain ABVD-based because omitting either bleomycin or dacarbazine increased the risk of relapse.

**Relevant Clinical Trial IDs (NCT numbers):**

While the search results don't directly provide a trial comparing ABVD to AV alone, they do mention trials exploring modifications of ABVD and related regimens:

*   **NCT00654732:** This trial compared ABVD to Rituximab plus ABVD (R-ABVD) in advanced-stage, high-risk Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.
*   **NCT01712490:** This trial studied A+AVD (Brentuximab vedotin, Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) versus ABVD as frontline therapy for advanced Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.
*   **NCT01060904:** Phase 1 study of Brentuximab vedotin combined with ABVD or AVD for patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma.
*   **NCT02505269:** Study exploring the omission of vinblastine to minimize toxicity.

The information suggests that ABVD is more effective than AV alone, as the omission of bleomycin or dacarbazine from ABVD can lead to a higher risk of relapse.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of VMP compared to VMPT when used to treat Multiple myeloma.,NCT01063179,"Based on the search results, here's a summary of the efficacy of VMP compared to VMPT in treating multiple myeloma, along with relevant clinical trial IDs:

**Efficacy of VMP vs. VMPT/VMPT-VT**

*   **VMPT/VMPT-VT generally shows superior outcomes compared to VMP alone.** Studies indicate that adding thalidomide to VMP (creating VMPT) and following it with bortezomib-thalidomide maintenance (VT) leads to better progression-free survival (PFS) and complete response (CR) rates.

    *   One study (Palumbo et al., 2010) found that the 3-year PFS rate was 56% for VMPT-VT versus 41% for VMP (p=0.008). Complete response rates were also significantly higher in the VMPT-VT group (38% vs. 24%, p < 0.001).
    *   Another study (Bringhen et al., 2014) also confirmed the superiority of VMPT-VT over VMP.
*   **Improved CR Rate:** The four-drug combination VMPT significantly increased the complete response rate compared to VMP.
*   **PFS Improvement:** There was a numerical increase in PFS with VMPT, although in some studies, this increase wasn't statistically significant. Longer follow-up is suggested to fully assess the effects on PFS and overall survival (OS).
*   **Important Considerations:** While VMPT-VT may offer better outcomes, it's also associated with a higher incidence of certain side effects like neutropenia, cardiologic events, and thromboembolic events.

**Relevant Clinical Trial IDs (NCT Numbers)**

*   **NCT02195479:** This trial compares VMP to Daratumumab in combination with VMP (D-VMP) in previously untreated multiple myeloma patients ineligible for high-dose therapy.
*   **NCT00111319:** This trial studies VELCADE/Melphalan/Prednisone versus Melphalan/Prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

**In summary, VMPT-VT has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to VMP alone in several studies, particularly in terms of progression-free survival and complete response rates. However, it's important to consider the potential for increased side effects with the more intensive VMPT-VT regimen.**

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of VTD compared to Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (TD) when used to treat Multiple myeloma.,NCT01134484,"Based on the search results, here's a summary of the efficacy of VTD compared to TD in treating Multiple Myeloma, along with relevant clinical trial IDs:

**Efficacy of VTD vs. TD:**

*   **Higher Complete Response (CR) Rate:** Several studies indicate that VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone) results in a significantly higher complete response rate compared to TD (thalidomide and dexamethasone) both before and after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).
    *   One study reported a CR rate of 35% with VTD versus 14% with TD (P = .001).
    *   Another analysis showed a post-ASCT CR rate of 46% with VTD versus 24% with TD (P = .004).
*   **Longer Progression-Free Survival (PFS):** VTD is associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival compared to TD.
    *   One study reported a median PFS of 56.2 months with VTD versus 28.2 months with TD (P = .01).
*   **Higher Overall Response Rate:** VTD generally demonstrates a higher overall response rate compared to TD.
*   **Deeper Responses:** Adding Daratumumab to VTD (D-VTD) leads to deeper responses and increased MRD negativity compared to VTD alone.

**Clinical Trial ID:**

*   **NCT00461747:** This trial, conducted by the Spanish Myeloma Group, compared VTD versus TD and another regimen (VBMCP/VBAD/B) in patients with multiple myeloma. It demonstrated the superiority of VTD in terms of CR rate and PFS.
*   **NCT02541383:** The CASSIOPEIA trial investigated the addition of daratumumab to VTD (D-VTD) versus VTD alone.

Therefore, VTD is more efficacious than TD in treating multiple myeloma

*   **Improved Outcomes:** High-dose melphalan (HDM) therapy combined with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) improves response rate, event-free survival, and overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma compared to melphalan monotherapy.

*   **Tandem vs. Single ASCT:** Studies suggest that tandem ASCT (two sequential transplants) may offer progression-free survival (PFS) benefits compared to a single ASCT, particularly in high-risk patients. However, some studies have not shown a significant overall survival (OS) advantage with tandem ASCT.

While I couldn't find one specific clinical trial ID (NCT number) directly comparing tandem melphalan to melphalan monotherapy, NCT01362972 is related to melphalan dosing in autologous stem cell transplantation for lymphoma and myeloma.

    *   One study, NCT01086826, compared induction TPF (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-Fluorouracil) followed by concomitant treatment versus concomitant treatment alone in locally advanced head and neck cancer. The study found that overall survival was significantly higher in the induction chemotherapy (IC) arm compared to the no-induction arm (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.56–0.97; P = 0.031). Complete response, progression-free survival and loco-regional control were also significantly higher in the IC arm.

Keep in mind that the effectiveness and suitability of different treatment approaches can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and other individual factors. It's essential to discuss treatment options with a qualified oncologist.

*   **Lenalidomide vs. Placebo:** Lenalidomide monotherapy generally demonstrates superior efficacy compared to placebo in treating multiple myeloma, particularly in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). However, lenalidomide is associated with an increased risk of second primary malignancies (SPMs).
*   **Lenalidomide Maintenance After ASCT:** Lenalidomide maintenance therapy following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) significantly improves PFS compared to placebo.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Lenalidomide is often used in combination with other drugs like dexamethasone or ixazomib. These combinations have shown improved outcomes compared to lenalidomide alone or placebo-based regimens.

**Relevant Clinical Trial IDs:**

*   **NCT00114101:** This trial (CALGB 100104) compared lenalidomide maintenance to placebo after ASCT, demonstrating improved time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) with lenalidomide, but also an increased risk of SPMs.
*   **NCT03941860:** This phase III trial studies how well lenalidomide in combination with ixazomib works compared to lenalidomide alone.
*   **NCT01564537:** This study compared ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (IRd) versus placebo-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (placebo-Rd)

*   **Improved Overall Survival:** The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group CO.17 study demonstrated that patients with advanced colorectal cancer had improved overall survival when cetuximab was given in addition to best supportive care. In this study, cetuximab monotherapy showed a statistically significant overall survival advantage. The median survival for cetuximab vs. best supportive care was 6.1 months vs. 4.6 months (HR for death = 0.77, P = .005). The survival advantage was even greater in the subset of patients with wild-type KRAS tumors (median overall survival for cetuximab vs. best supportive care: 9.5 months vs. 4.8 months, HR for death = 0.55, P < .001).

*   **Improved Progression-Free Survival:** In the BOND trial, patients who had disease progression on irinotecan-based regimens were randomly assigned to cetuximab monotherapy versus cetuximab and irinotecan. Patients in the combination therapy group experienced improved progression-free survival (4.1 versus 1.5 months).

**Efficacy Summary:**

*   **Limited Efficacy Overall:** Studies suggest that Durvalumab and Tremelimumab have limited efficacy in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC, especially as monotherapy. MSS CRC does not respond well to immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC.
*   **Overall Survival (OS) Improvement:** A phase 2 study (CCTG CO.26) showed that the combination of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab might be associated with prolonged OS in patients with advanced refractory CRC compared to BSC alone. The median OS was 6.6 months for Durvalumab and Tremelimumab vs. 4.1 months for BSC.
*   **Progression-Free Survival (PFS):** The same study reported that progression-free survival was similar between the Durvalumab/Tremelimumab group (1.8 months) and the BSC group (1.9 months).
*   **TMB as a Factor:** Patients with MSS tumors and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) seemed to derive the greatest OS benefit from the combination therapy.
*   **Combination with Chemotherapy:** One study (MEDITREME trial) evaluated Durvalumab and Tremelimumab with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in RAS-mutated metastatic CRC, showing promising clinical activity and tolerability.
*   **Response Rates:** The response rate to Durvalumab/Tremelimumab was generally low.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of ADT compared to ADT and RT when used to treat Prostate cancer.,NCT00002633,"Based on the information from the searches, here's a summary of the efficacy of ADT compared to ADT and RT for prostate cancer, along with relevant clinical trial IDs:

**Efficacy of ADT vs. ADT + RT:**

*   Several clinical trials have shown that adding ADT to definitive radiation therapy (RT) provides a benefit for treating locally advanced prostate cancer.
*   Specifically, adding RT to ADT improves overall survival and reduces the risk of prostate cancer-specific death.
*   Longer durations of ADT have been shown to be more effective than shorter durations.

**Relevant Clinical Trial IDs:**

*   **NCT0023145:** Canadian Prostate Cancer Study IV, which compared 18 months of ADT versus 36 months of ADT in addition to RT.
*   **NCT04513717:** A study evaluating less intense and more intense treatments for high-risk prostate cancer based on gene risk score, comparing different durations of ADT with or without additional therapies alongside RT.
*   **NCT02531516:** ATLAS trial, evaluating the addition of ERLEADA to GnRHa and EBRT in high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.
*   **NCT03311555:** STARTAR trial, evaluating salvage treatment with ERLEADA and ADT plus salvage RT followed by docetaxel in patients with PSA recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.
*   **NCT00936390, NCT00021450, NCT00104741:** Ongoing trials expected to provide a definitive answer on whether intermediate-risk PC patients need ADT at all when treated with dose-escalation RT.

Choose an option that best describes the efficacy of Intermittent ADT compared to ADT when used to treat Prostate cancer.,NCT00003653,"Based on the search results, here's a summary of the efficacy of intermittent ADT (IADT) compared to continuous ADT (CADT) for prostate cancer:

*   **Non-inferiority in some cases:** Some studies, like the NCIC PR-7 trial, showed that overall survival with IADT was not inferior to CADT in men with rising PSA levels after radiation or radical prostatectomy. The ICELAND trial (NCT00378690) also demonstrated similar efficacy, tolerability, and quality of life profiles for IADT and CADT in patients with relapsing M0 or locally advanced prostate cancer.
*   **Inconclusive or worse outcomes in metastatic disease:** The SWOG trial was inconclusive regarding non-inferiority. A meta-analysis indicated a slightly increased risk in disease-specific survival for men treated with IADT relative to CADT. One study of metastatic PCa found IADT had a slightly shorter overall survival.
*   **Quality of Life:** Certain aspects of quality of life were better in the intermittent arms of some trials. IADT may result in fewer treatment-related adverse events and better quality of life outcomes compared to CADT.
*   **Patient Selection:** If using ADT in the setting of biochemical relapse, intermittent ADT should be strongly considered over continuous ADT, except perhaps in patients with Gleason score of 8 or higher. In men with metastatic disease, continuous ADT remains the standard of care, because the SWOG trial did not establish noninferiority of intermittent ADT with respect to survival. However, for those with significant side effects from ADT, establishing the risk group, as determined by PSA value after 7 months of ADT or the presence of pain at diagnosis, may help guide the choice of intermittent versus continuous ADT in men with metastatic disease.

*   **POLLUX trial (RRMM):** Dara-Rd significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to Rd alone (mPFS 45.5 months vs 17.5 months, p < 0.001). It also resulted in deeper responses, with 30.4% of patients achieving negative minimal residual disease (MRD) compared to Rd alone. The median overall survival (OS) was also longer in the Dara-Rd group (67.6 months vs 51.8 months, p = 0.023). The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for the POLLUX trial is **NCT02076009**.
*   **MAIA trial (NDMM):** This study involved transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). The addition of daratumumab to Rd improved progression-free survival (median 61.9 months in Dara-Rd arm). The clinical trial identifier is **NCT02252172**.

Therefore, Dara-Rd is more effective than Rd alone in treating multiple myeloma, leading to longer PFS, improved overall survival, and deeper responses.

*   **PROSPECT Trial:** This trial (though a specific NCT ID isn't provided in the snippets) indicated that in *some* patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, radiation therapy *could be safely omitted* if the tumor responded well to initial chemotherapy (modified FOLFOX6). The study found no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival or overall survival between those who received chemoradiation and those who received FOLFOX with selective chemoradiation.
*   **Benefits of adding chemotherapy (like FULV) to radiation:** Several sources ([6], [7]) mention that combining chemotherapy (particularly fluoropyrimidines like 5-FU) with radiation therapy improves local control and reduces local recurrence rates compared to radiation therapy alone.
*   **Specific Trials:**
    *   The German CAO/ARO/AIO-94 study ([4]) showed improved tumor stage reduction and local recurrence rates with preoperative fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy compared to postoperative.
    *   Another German study, CAO/ARO/AIO-04 ([4]), showed that adding oxaliplatin to 5-FU-RT improved disease-free survival.
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   The choice between different approaches (chemoradiation vs. chemotherapy alone, short-course vs. long-course radiation) often depends on factors like tumor characteristics, patient health, and accessibility of treatment.

While a specific NCT ID that directly compares FULV/RT to RT alone isn't explicitly stated in the search results, the overall evidence suggests that adding chemotherapy like FULV to radiation therapy generally improves outcomes in locally advanced rectal cancer.

*   **Erlotinib monotherapy after chemotherapy:** Studies have shown that erlotinib monotherapy, when used after the failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, can provide a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to placebo. Specifically, one study noted a 19% reduction in the risk of cancer progression (P = 0.0088) and a 29% reduction in the risk of disease progression (P < 0.0001) with erlotinib following chemotherapy.
*   **Erlotinib as maintenance therapy:** The SATURN trial, a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, compared erlotinib with placebo in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease had not progressed following platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. The results indicated that median PFS and OS were significantly longer with erlotinib treatment than with placebo (median PFS 12.3 weeks versus 11.1 weeks, HR 0.71, P < 0.0001).

While erlotinib monotherapy can offer benefits in terms of PFS and OS in certain NSCLC patient populations, it's important to note that not all studies have shown a significant survival advantage. For instance, one study concluded that erlotinib combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy did not confer a survival advantage over carboplatin/paclitaxel alone in previously untreated advanced NSCLC.

*   **Cisplatin is a foundational treatment:** Cisplatin is identified as the most active single agent for treating hepatoblastoma.
*   **Combination Chemotherapy May Offer Benefits:** Several studies explore the benefits of combination chemotherapy. The general consensus is that combination chemotherapy, including Cisplatin and Doxorubicin, may kill more tumor cells than one type of chemotherapy alone.
*   **Similar Efficacy in Some Studies:** One study, the Intergroup Liver Tumor study, showed similar efficacy between cisplatin/5-FU/VCR and cisplatin plus doxorubicin regimens. However, due to increased toxicity, the cisplatin/5-FU/VCR combination was considered standard.
*   **Comparable Outcomes in a Specific Trial:** A study by Perilongo et al. compared preoperative cisplatin alone to cisplatin plus doxorubicin in standard-risk hepatoblastoma patients. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was 83% for cisplatin alone and 85% for the cisplatin/doxorubicin group, with overall survival rates of 95% and 93%, respectively.

*   **TEAM Trial Findings:** The Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial (NCT00279448, NCT00032136, and NCT00036270) compared exemestane monotherapy to sequential treatment (tamoxifen followed by exemestane). While initial results showed no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years, long-term follow-up data confirmed that both exemestane alone and sequential treatment are reasonable options.
*   **First-line Treatment:** Aromatase inhibitors like exemestane have largely replaced tamoxifen as first-line endocrine therapy due to greater efficacy and tolerability in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
*   **Metastatic Breast Cancer:** One phase III trial showed a higher overall response rate with exemestane compared to tamoxifen as a first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

Here's why and what the search revealed:

*   **Dexamethasone is Often Used in Combination:** Dexamethasone is frequently used *in combination* with other drugs like lenalidomide, bortezomib, or isatuximab for multiple myeloma treatment. It's difficult to isolate its effect as a single agent in direct comparison to Rd from these results.

*   **Rd (Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone) is a Standard Treatment:** Several studies use Rd as a *comparator* arm, meaning it's a recognized and effective treatment against which new therapies are tested. This suggests Rd is generally considered more effective than dexamethasone alone.

*   **Dexamethasone Enhances Other Therapies:** Some studies show that adding dexamethasone to other drugs *improves* outcomes. For example, adding dexamethasone to isatuximab increased response rates .

*   **Single-Agent Lenalidomide:** One study suggests lenalidomide's anti-tumor effects might be better when used alone (or independent of corticosteroids), but this doesn't directly address dexamethasone monotherapy.

* **Clinical Trial Focus:** Many of the listed clinical trials focus on combinations *including* dexamethasone or comparing a new combination to Rd, not dexamethasone versus Rd.
