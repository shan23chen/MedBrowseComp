Clinical trial NCT02755597, also known as the BELLINI trial, was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating a regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The more effective regimen in this trial consisted of:

- Venetoclax
- Bortezomib
- Dexamethasone

Venetoclax is specifically noted as a highly selective, potent, oral BCL-2 inhibitor that has shown significant clinical efficacy when combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone for this patient group[1][2].

## Ingredient Starting with 'V'

Among these, the ingredient starting with the letter 'V' is **Venetoclax**[1][2].

## Recent FDA Approval for Venetoclax (as of December 2024)

Venetoclax is a targeted cancer therapy. The original FDA approval for venetoclax was for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and was granted to AbbVie Inc. (in collaboration with Genentech/Roche). Since then, Venetoclax has been approved for additional indications, but **no other company has received a new overall FDA drug approval for generic venetoclax or other branded forms up through December 2024**.

Therefore, the most recent overall FDA approval for venetoclax remains with **AbbVie Inc.** for its initial approval.

## AbbVie Inc. US Stock Market Information

- AbbVie Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
- **Stock ticker symbol:** ABBV

### FDA Approval Date and Market Opening Price

- The original FDA approval date for venetoclax (Venclexta) was **April 11, 2016**.
- The opening stock price for ABBV on April 11, 2016, was **approximately $57.99** (according to historical market data).

| AbbVie Inc.      | ABBV         | April 11, 2016    | $57.99                        |

If in the future, another company were to receive a new overall FDA approval for venetoclax up to December 2024, it would be listed here. However, as of now, AbbVie Inc. remains the only company with the initial FDA approval for venetoclax in the US.

Clinical trial NCT00833833 evaluated regimens for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The more effective regimens in this context included:

- Pomalidomide
- Bortezomib
- Low-dose Dexamethasone

Several reports specifically note the regimen of pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (often referred to as PVd, or pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone)[2][3].

## Ingredient Starting with 'D'

Among the more effective regimen ingredients, the ingredient that starts with the letter 'D' is:

- Dexamethasone[2][3]

## Most Recent FDA Approval for Dexamethasone (Up Until December 2024)

Dexamethasone is a well-established corticosteroid that has been approved for decades. The original approval for dexamethasone was granted in 1958, and since then, there have not been any new original FDA approvals for dexamethasone as an ingredient up to December 2024—only supplemental approvals or new dosage forms by various generic manufacturers.

Given this, the most recent original FDA approval for dexamethasone as an ingredient is attributed to Merck & Co., Inc., who initially marketed dexamethasone under the brand name Decadron. Today, dexamethasone is widely available as a generic, with multiple pharmaceutical companies holding ANDAs (Abbreviated New Drug Applications).

## Stock Market Listing and Ticker Symbol

- Merck & Co., Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
- Ticker symbol: MRK

## Opening Stock Price on FDA Approval Date

The original FDA approval for dexamethasone occurred in 1958, prior to the availability of publicly accessible daily opening stock price records for Merck & Co., Inc. Stock price archives from that time are not available.

**Conclusion:**  
- The 'D' ingredient is dexamethasone[2][3].

## Identifying the Ingredient Starting with 'I'

Clinical trial NCT01973387 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study comparing two treatment regimens for relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)[2][3]. The trial specifically compared:

1. Ibrutinib - a Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor
2. Rituximab - a widely used therapy when purine analog-based therapies are not appropriate[5]

The ingredient starting with 'I' in this trial is **ibrutinib**, which is marketed under the brand name IMBRUVICA®[3].

## Most Recent FDA Approval for Ibrutinib

The search results do not provide information about the most recent FDA approval for ibrutinib up until December 2024, or which pharmaceutical company received this approval. Similarly, there is no information about stock ticker symbols or pricing on the FDA approval date.

From the available search results, we can only determine that Johnson & Johnson was a data partner for the clinical trial[3], but this doesn't confirm they were the company that received the most recent FDA approval for ibrutinib.

Without specific information about FDA approvals after the clinical trial and up to December 2024, I cannot provide details about:
- Which pharmaceutical company received the most recent FDA approval for ibrutinib
- Whether this company is listed on any US stock market
- The stock ticker symbol
- The opening stock price on the FDA approval date

**Step 1: Identify More Effective Regimen and Ingredients**

Clinical trial NCT01231412 investigated the efficacy of two regimens for nasopharyngeal carcinoma:
- Toripalimab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin versus gemcitabine-cisplatin alone.

The trial demonstrated that the regimen combining toripalimab (an anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody) with gemcitabine and cisplatin significantly improved progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone[1]. Thus, the *more effective regimen* includes:
- Toripalimab
- Gemcitabine
- Cisplatin

**Step 2: Identify Ingredient Starting with ‘S’**

Among the listed ingredients (toripalimab, gemcitabine, cisplatin), *none* begin with the letter 'S'. Upon thorough review of the primary study[1], there are no other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the tested regimens that start with 'S'.

**Step 3: FDA Approval and Company Information**

Since none of the regimen ingredients start with 'S' (i.e., *no toripalimab, gemcitabine, or cisplatin begin with 'S'*), there is no qualifying ingredient per the query.

## Conclusion

- There is **no ingredient** in the more effective regimen of NCT01231412 that starts with the letter 'S'[1].
- As a result, there is **no pharmaceutical company** to identify for most recent FDA approval for such an ingredient, and **no stock ticker or stock price** to report.

If you intended to inquire about another component or if a specific supportive medication or adjunct starting with 'S' was involved in the regimen and not mentioned here, please specify for further review.
