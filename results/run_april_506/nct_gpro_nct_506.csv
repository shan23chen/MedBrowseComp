"Find/search the clinical trial id that best describes the efficacy of Abiraterone monotherapy compared to Prednisone monotherapy when used to treat Prostate cancer.
Output it in the format NCT<Number>",NCT01591122,"Okay, finding a trial that *strictly* compares Abiraterone **monotherapy** against Prednisone **monotherapy** for efficacy in prostate cancer is challenging because Abiraterone is almost always studied *with* Prednisone to manage side effects. Prednisone monotherapy is also not a standard comparator for efficacy against potent agents like Abiraterone in major trials.

However, the pivotal trial that established Abiraterone's efficacy essentially compared Abiraterone + Prednisone against Placebo + Prednisone. This design effectively isolates the efficacy contribution of Abiraterone *over* Prednisone alone.

The most representative trial for this comparison (Abiraterone+Prednisone vs Placebo+Prednisone) in the post-chemotherapy setting is COU-AA-301:

"Find/search the clinical trial id that best describes the efficacy of Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) compared to Esophagectomy when used to treat Esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Output it in the format NCT<Number>",NCT00002883,"It is challenging to find a single, definitive clinical trial that perfectly matches the criteria of *directly* comparing the efficacy of Cisplatin and Fluorouracil (CF) chemotherapy *alone* versus Esophagectomy *alone* specifically for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma, primarily because:

1.  **Standard of Care Evolution:** For potentially curative treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma, either surgery (often with neoadjuvant chemo/chemoradiation) or definitive chemoradiation (chemo + radiation therapy) are standard considerations. CF chemotherapy *alone* is not typically used as a curative-intent alternative to surgery for localized disease.
2.  **Common Trial Designs:** Most modern comparative trials involving surgery for esophageal cancer compare:
    *   Surgery alone vs. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (like CF) + Surgery.
    *   Surgery alone vs. Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy + Surgery.
    *   Definitive Chemoradiotherapy (e.g., CF + Radiation) vs. Surgery (sometimes preceded by neoadjuvant therapy).

Therefore, a trial pitting just CF chemo against just surgery is uncommon for adenocarcinoma. Landmark trials often incorporate radiation with chemotherapy when comparing against surgery (definitive chemoradiation vs. surgery) or evaluate chemotherapy/chemoradiation *in addition* to surgery (neoadjuvant setting).

Given these complexities, a specific NCT ID for the *exact* comparison requested isn't readily available or representative of major comparative efficacy studies in this precise setting. Research often focuses on multimodal approaches.",,False,

"Find/search the clinical trial id that best describes the efficacy of Cytarabine and Daunorubicin compared to 4d plus 7 when used to treat Acute myeloid leukemia.
Output it in the format NCT<Number>",NCT00363025,"Based on the description, you are likely looking for trials comparing the standard ""7+3"" induction regimen (7 days of Cytarabine and 3 days of Daunorubicin) with a variation or intensification. The term ""4d plus 7"" isn't standard nomenclature for a widely recognized AML regimen compared against 7+3 in major trials.

However, a very common and significant comparison in AML induction efficacy involves modifying the standard 7+3, particularly by increasing the dose of Daunorubicin. Several trials compared standard-dose Daunorubicin (e.g., 45 mg/m²) with high-dose Daunorubicin (e.g., 90 mg/m²), both given for 3 days alongside 7 days of Cytarabine.

One key trial that included this comparison (standard vs. high-dose Daunorubicin as part of the 7+3 backbone) is the ECOG E1900 study:

**NCT00049517**

While this trial also investigated Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, its dataset was crucial in establishing the efficacy benefit of higher-dose Daunorubicin (90 mg/m² x 3 days) compared to the standard dose (45 mg/m² x 3 days) when combined with 7 days of Cytarabine for younger patients with AML.

Here's why:

1.  **Ethical Considerations:** Once Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) was established as an effective treatment for VTE, it became ethically problematic to assign patients with a potentially life-threatening condition like DVT or PE to a placebo group for initial treatment.
2.  **Standard of Care:** Consequently, pivotal trials establishing the efficacy of Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWHs) like Enoxaparin for VTE *treatment* typically compared them against the existing standard of care, which was UFH (e.g., trials by Levine et al., Merli et al., the Columbus Investigators – often registered later or under different protocols than modern NCT numbers might capture easily).
3.  **Prophylaxis vs. Treatment:** Placebo-controlled trials are much more common in the setting of VTE *prophylaxis* (prevention) in at-risk individuals (e.g., post-surgery, acutely ill medical patients) where the risk/benefit of anticoagulation vs. placebo can be ethically evaluated. An example of a major *prophylaxis* trial is MEDENOX (NCT00003896), which compared different doses of enoxaparin to placebo for VTE prevention in acutely ill medical patients, but this is not *treatment*.

Therefore, based on standard clinical trial practices and ethical guidelines for treating acute VTE, a trial directly comparing Enoxaparin monotherapy to Placebo for *treatment efficacy* is highly unlikely to be a major registered study you can easily find with an NCT number representing that specific primary comparison.

3.  Targeted Agent Monotherapy vs. Best Supportive Care or another agent (often in later lines of therapy).

However, the trial that established the benefit of *adding* Cetuximab to a FOLFOX backbone (showing the combination is better than chemo alone, implying the combination would also be better than Cetuximab alone) is the **OPUS trial**:

Trials typically compare:
1.  ADT vs ADT + *one* novel hormonal agent (e.g., Abiraterone OR Apalutamide).
2.  ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Docetaxel + *one* novel hormonal agent.
3.  In castration-resistant settings, adding a novel agent to an existing regimen.

The trial **NCT02257736 (ACIS)** studied Apalutamide in combination with Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone (AAP) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients were likely on continuous ADT. The comparison arms were:
*   Arm 1: Apalutamide + Abiraterone Acetate + Prednisone (+ ADT)
*   Arm 2: Placebo + Abiraterone Acetate + Prednisone (+ ADT)

While this trial evaluates the *addition* of Apalutamide to an Abiraterone/ADT backbone (effectively comparing ADT+Abi vs ADT+Abi+Apa), it does *not* compare the triplet directly against ADT alone.

Given the constraints and the specific comparison requested, a trial perfectly matching your description (ADT vs ADT+Abiraterone+Apalutamide) is not readily identifiable. However, ACIS is the most relevant study involving the specific combination of Abiraterone and Apalutamide together with ADT.

Output it in the format NCT<Number>",NCT00310180,"Finding a single, large, randomized Phase III trial that *directly* compares **Observation (no adjuvant treatment)** versus the **TAC regimen (Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide)** specifically for efficacy in breast cancer is challenging.

This is because:
1.  **Ethical Considerations:** For patient groups where TAC is typically considered (e.g., node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer), chemotherapy has a known, significant survival benefit compared to observation alone. It would generally be considered unethical to randomize such patients to a 'no treatment' arm when effective therapy exists.
2.  **Trial Design Evolution:** Most pivotal trials involving TAC compared it against older chemotherapy standards (like FAC or FEC) to establish its superiority, rather than against observation.

However, the landmark trial that established the superior efficacy of TAC compared to a previous standard (FAC), thereby strongly *implying* its significant benefit over observation in node-positive breast cancer, is the **BCIRG 001** trial. While it doesn't have an observation arm, its results demonstrating improved disease-free and overall survival with TAC are key to understanding its efficacy relative to doing less.

Therefore, the trial that *best demonstrates the significant efficacy of TAC* (implying superiority over observation for the indicated population) is:
