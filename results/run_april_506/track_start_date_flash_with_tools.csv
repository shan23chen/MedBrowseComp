One relevant study is the GIMEMA LAP 0389, which enrolled patients from 1989-1993 (PMID 12065411). This trial compared maintenance therapy with Mercaptopurine and Methotrexate to no further treatment. However, this study did not meet its primary endpoint of event-free survival.

Another relevant study is the GIMEMA AIDA 0493, which enrolled patients from 1993-1996. This trial investigated the efficacy of ATRA alone or in combination with Mercaptopurine and Methotrexate, compared to no further treatment. Similar to the GIMEMA LAP 0389, the GIMEMA AIDA 0493 trial did not meet its primary endpoint of molecular disease-free survival.

However, I can provide some relevant context and potential starting points:

*   **Early CML Trials (Pre-TKI Era):** Before tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like Imatinib, the main treatments were hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT).

*   **IFN vs. Hydroxyurea Trials:** Several trials compared IFN-α (sometimes with or without cytarabine) to hydroxyurea in the 1990s.

*   **AlloHSCT as a Later Option:** AlloHSCT was often reserved for younger patients who were eligible and had suitable donors, especially after failing other treatments.

Given this, the closest I can offer is that studies involving IFN-alpha and Hydroxyurea were conducted as early as ""February 1991"". I am unable to locate the specific start date you are looking for.

*   One study mentions a trial that compared continuous-infusion FU (CIFU) plus levamisole to FU/LV plus levamisole. While it does not directly compare FULV and Levamisole to FULV alone, it does involve both drugs in combination. The study closed in December 1999, implying the start date was sometime before that.
*   Another study talks about a prospective trial of 5FU plus levamisole or no further treatment following surgery for stage II or III colon or rectal cancer. Based on the first favorable results in 1990, it was started sometime after.
