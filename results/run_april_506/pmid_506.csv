    *   One source states that combining goserelin 3.6 mg with tamoxifen has shown superior efficacy to goserelin alone and at least equivalent efficacy to CMF chemotherapy
    *   One study compared CMF versus Zoladex (goserelin) + Tamoxifen in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer (ACO5). However, this study is marked as ""complete"" but without readily available results in the search snippets.

*   **CMF followed by Tamoxifen:**

    *   One study (IBCSG Trial IX) investigated CMF followed by tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal patients. It concluded CMF wasn't beneficial in ER-positive node-negative breast cancer but was effective in the ER-negative group. *This study focuses on postmenopausal women*.

*   **Goserelin + Anastrozole vs. Goserelin + Tamoxifen:**

    *   The STAGE study compared goserelin plus anastrozole versus goserelin plus tamoxifen.

*   **Ovarian Suppression Trials:**

    *   A Cochrane Library review discusses ovarian suppression (which goserelin achieves) as adjuvant treatment.

It is important to note that the studies found often examine these treatments in specific contexts (e.g., premenopausal vs. postmenopausal, ER-positive vs. ER-negative, node-positive vs. node-negative), so the ""best"" paper depends on the specific patient population you're interested in.

Without a clearer ""best"" option, I can suggest looking into the following studies, searching for their PubMed IDs, and reading their full text:

1.  **The IBCSG Trial VIII:** This trial randomized premenopausal women with node-negative, ER+ early breast cancer to CMF, goserelin, or CMF followed by goserelin. It found a benefit in women <40 years old with the addition of goserelin.

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Anastrozole monotherapy compared to Observation when used to treat Breast cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",18073378,"Based on the search results, identifying a single paper that *directly* compares Anastrozole monotherapy to *observation* alone for breast cancer treatment efficacy is challenging. Most studies compare Anastrozole to Tamoxifen or investigate its use after Tamoxifen treatment.

However, I can offer some relevant findings and potentially useful papers:

*   **ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) Trial:** This large trial compared Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, and a combination of both as adjuvant therapy. While it doesn't have a pure ""observation"" arm, it provides strong evidence for Anastrozole's efficacy compared to the previous standard, Tamoxifen (PMID information can be found within the search results, such as in \[5]).
*   **ABCSG Trial 6a:** This trial, mentioned in \[2], investigated Anastrozole after initial treatment. While not a direct comparison to *initial* observation, it showed that women receiving Anastrozole after prior treatment had a statistically significant reduced risk of recurrence compared to those receiving no further treatment.
*   **Meta-Analyses:** Several meta-analyses (e.g., mentioned in \[3] and \[7]) consolidate data from multiple trials. These often show that aromatase inhibitors, including Anastrozole, reduce recurrence rates compared to Tamoxifen.

It's important to note that directly comparing Anastrozole to observation alone would likely be unethical in most cases today, given the established benefits of endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Given the constraints and the data available, it's difficult to provide a single PMID for a direct Anastrozole vs. Observation study. However, the ATAC trial provides significant data on Anastrozole's efficacy as an initial adjuvant therapy.

The article titled ""Use of Prednisone With Abiraterone Acetate in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer"" discusses the rationale for using Prednisone in conjunction with Abiraterone. While it doesn't directly compare the two as monotherapies in a clinical trial, it explains why Abiraterone is *not* used as a monotherapy due to mineralocorticoid-related adverse events. It references earlier studies of Abiraterone monotherapy where these adverse events were more common, leading to the co-administration of low-dose prednisone to mitigate these effects. Although it doesn't offer a head-to-head efficacy comparison, it provides crucial context.
Unfortunately, the search results did not yield a single paper that directly compares the efficacy of abiraterone monotherapy versus prednisone monotherapy in prostate cancer treatment.

It's important to note that bevacizumab monotherapy is generally *not* a standard treatment approach for colorectal cancer. Bevacizumab is typically used in combination with chemotherapy. Therefore, the comparisons are usually between fluoropyrimidine + bevacizumab *vs.* fluoropyrimidine alone, or more complex chemotherapy regimens +/- bevacizumab.

Here's a breakdown of relevant findings:

*   **Bevacizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer - PubMed:** This paper with pmid 21047491, focuses on a review of clinical effectiveness of bevacizumab when combined with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, versus chemotherapy alone, for first-line treatment. It references the NO16966 trial which showed significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival with the addition of bevacizumab to either XELOX or FOLFOX regimens.
*   **Bevacizumab combined with standard fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimens to treat colorectal cancer - PubMed:** This review article, highlights that adding bevacizumab to 5-FU based chemotherapy in the first-line setting improves survival, progression-free survival, and response rate compared to chemotherapy alone.
*   **Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab Combined With Fluoropyrimidine Monotherapy for Unfit or Older Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - PubMed:** With pmid 28188187, the study suggests adding bevacizumab to first-line fluoropyrimidine monochemotherapy significantly improved progression-free and overall survival in unfit and elderly patients with mCRC.

Several studies compare S-1-based regimens (including SOX) to other treatments for gastric cancer.

Many focus on SOX vs. other combination therapies (like FOLFOX) or S-1 monotherapy vs. other monotherapies (especially in elderly patients).

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",26735993,"Based on the search results, it's difficult to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of observation versus ATG (Rabbit) monotherapy for Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The studies found generally discuss ATG as part of a broader prophylaxis or treatment regimen, rather than comparing it directly to observation alone.

Here's a breakdown of what the search found and some potential avenues for finding a more direct answer:

*   **ATG in GvHD Prophylaxis:** Several papers discuss ATG (particularly rabbit ATG) as part of GvHD prophylaxis, often in combination with other immunosuppressants like Cyclosporine A (CsA) and Methotrexate (MTX).
*   **ATG Dosing:** One study discusses the impact of different ATG doses on GvHD.
*   **ATG vs. Other Therapies:** Some papers compare ATG to other therapies like porcine anti-lymphocyte globulin (pALG).
*   **No Direct Observation Comparison:** None of the snippets directly compare ATG monotherapy to observation alone.

To find a paper that *directly* compares observation to ATG monotherapy, you might need to refine your search with more specific keywords.

*   A systematic review and meta-analysis published in PubMed (PMID not available in the snippet) examines the efficacy and safety of combining erlotinib and bevacizumab with erlotinib alone in advanced NSCLC patients. The study indicates that the combination prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) but did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) or objective response rate (ORR).
*   BMJ Open published a systematic review and meta-analysis with the PMID not available in the snippet, investigating the efficacy and safety of erlotinib plus bevacizumab in EGFRm+ advanced NSCLC.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",37861993,"Based on the search results, here's the information to help you find the relevant PubMed ID:

**Understanding the Treatments**

*   **Carboplatin and Pemetrexed:** This is a chemotherapy doublet commonly used in non-squamous NSCLC.
*   **ABCP:** This acronym refers to a combination regimen of Atezolizumab, Bevacizumab, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel. Atezolizumab is an immunotherapy drug (specifically a PD-L1 inhibitor), and Bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic agent. Carboplatin and Paclitaxel are chemotherapy drugs.

**Key Studies and Findings**

*   **ATTLAS Trial (KCSG-LU19-04):** This phase III trial compared ABCP to Pemetrexed plus Carboplatin/Cisplatin (PC) in patients with EGFR- or ALK-mutated NSCLC who had progressed on prior Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). It found that ABCP was significantly more effective than PC in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).
*   **IMpower150:** This trial investigated ABCP versus BCP (Bevacizumab, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel) and ACP (Atezolizumab, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel) in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. The ABCP arm showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS and OS benefit compared to BCP in the wild-type population (patients without EGFR or ALK alterations).
*   **Bevacizumab addition to Carboplatin-Pemetrexed:** A retrospective study showed that adding bevacizumab to carboplatin-pemetrexed was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.

**Potentially Relevant PubMed IDs**

Given the information, here are some leads to find the specific paper you need, focusing on studies comparing Carboplatin/Pemetrexed to ABCP:

1.  **Phase III ATTLAS trial:** Look for the publication of the ATTLAS trial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology or other major journals. Search PubMed using terms like ""ATTLAS trial NSCLC,"" ""Atezolizumab Bevacizumab Carboplatin Paclitaxel EGFR ALK NSCLC,"" or ""KCSG-LU19-04.""
2.  **IMpower150 subgroup analyses:**  The IMpower150 trial had subgroup analyses that explored the efficacy of ABCP in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Search for publications related to IMpower150 subgroup analysis EGFR or ALK.

**To find the exact PubMed ID:**

*   Go to the PubMed website (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
*   Use the search terms identified above (ATTLAS trial NSCLC, etc.).
*   Look for articles that specifically compare Carboplatin/Pemetrexed-based regimens to ABCP in NSCLC.

*   **Relevant Paper:**
    *   One study, found in search result [1], specifically compared IV Bu-Flu to IV BuCy2 as pre-transplant conditioning in AML/MDS. It used a Bayesian method to analyze outcomes and found that Bu-Flu patients in CR1 had a 3-year overall survival of 78% and event-free survival of 74%. This study postulates that fludarabine instead of cyclophosphamide combined with IV busulfan as preconditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) would improve safety and retain antileukemic efficacy.

**2. Fludarabine and Melphalan (Flu/Mel) vs. Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy):**

*   **Key Finding:** Flu/Mel has emerged as a more tolerable option compared to Bu/Cy. Some studies suggest non-inferior disease control with Flu/Mel.
*   **Relevant Paper:**
    *   A retrospective review mentioned in search result [2] compared allo-HSCT outcomes in AML patients conditioned with Flu/Mel or Bu/Cy-based regimens. While Bu/Cy was associated with increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) on multivariable analysis, regimen choice was not associated with relapse rates (RR), relapse-free survival (RFS), or overall survival (OS). The study suggests Flu/Mel provides non-inferior disease control.

*   **The state of hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy in the management of metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver:** ([1]) This review provides a broad overview of HAI in treating colorectal cancer liver metastasis.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **FULV is a systemic chemotherapy regimen.** When comparing HAI to FULV, it's crucial to note whether the HAI is used *in addition to* systemic chemotherapy (like FULV) or *instead of* it. Many modern studies use HAI *plus* systemic chemotherapy.
*   **Modern Systemic Chemotherapy:** The effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy for mCRC has improved significantly over time. Studies need to be considered in the context of the specific systemic regimens used.
*   **Conversion to Resectability:** A key goal of HAI (often in combination with systemic chemo) is to shrink tumors enough to allow for surgical resection, which significantly improves outcomes.

*   **Long-term Efficacy and Safety of Ravulizumab:**
    *   A study published in January 2025 in *Annals of Hematology* found that ravulizumab provided durable control of terminal complement activity and intravascular hemolysis (IVH) for up to 6 years, resulting in a low incidence of thromboembolic events and reduced risk of mortality compared with untreated patients.
*   **Eculizumab Efficacy:**
    *   A meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in patients with PNH concluded that eculizumab is effective at decreasing LDH levels and transfusion rates while increasing Hb levels.

*   **Superiority of Drug Treatment:** One study (Source 2) indicated that drug treatment (IFN-based) was superior to early alloHSCT as a first-line therapy in CML, especially for low-risk patients. The study compared primary HSCT to the best available drug treatment (IFN based).
*   **Interferon Alfa vs. Chemotherapy:** A study from 1994 (Source 4) compared interferon alfa-2a with conventional chemotherapy (hydroxyurea or busulfan) and found that interferon alfa-2a led to more karyotypic responses, longer delays in disease progression, and improved overall survival.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Some studies explored the combination of interferon-alpha with other drugs like hydroxyurea (Source 9). One such study concluded that IFN in combination with HU achieves a significant long-term survival advantage over HU monotherapy.

*   **General Information on Drug Combinations:**

    *   Treatment for pediatric ALL often involves multiple phases, including induction, consolidation (intensification), and maintenance.
    *   Maintenance therapy typically includes daily mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate, sometimes with vincristine and steroid pulses.

*   **Role of Asparaginase (including Pegaspargase):**

    *   Asparaginase is a crucial component in ALL treatment.
    *   Pegaspargase, a form of asparaginase, is often incorporated into pediatric regimens.

*   **Methotrexate (MTX):**

    *   Methotrexate is essential for controlling systemic leukemia, as well as disease in the central nervous system (CNS) and testes.
    *   High-dose methotrexate has been shown to be superior to the Capizzi methotrexate regimen in high-risk B-ALL. The Capizzi regimen involves escalating intermediate doses of methotrexate followed by asparaginase.

*   **Relevant Studies & Trials (though not a direct comparison):**

    *   Children's Cancer Group (CCG) studies have explored the use of intensified treatment with vincristine and escalating-dose IV methotrexate.
    *   Some studies compared high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) versus Capizzi methotrexate (C-MTX) with pegaspargase during interim maintenance, with varying results depending on the specific type of ALL (B-ALL vs. T-ALL).
    *   Total Therapy Study XV demonstrated that cranial radiation therapy (CRT) could be safely omitted by intensifying systemic treatment with methotrexate, dexamethasone, asparaginase, and intrathecal therapy.

It appears that the most relevant research involves comparing high-dose methotrexate to Capizzi methotrexate (which includes asparaginase) within treatment protocols that also contain mercaptopurine and vincristine.

*   **Lenalidomide Monotherapy:**
    *   A systematic review and meta-analysis found lenalidomide monotherapy to be active and tolerable in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, especially in the non-GCB subgroup. The cumulative objective response rate (ORR) was 0.33 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.40), with a better ORR in patients with the non-GCB phenotype (0.50; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.74).
    *   One study (Wiernik PH, et al., 2008) examined lenalidomide monotherapy in relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    *   The DLC001 trial showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) with lenalidomide monotherapy compared to investigator's choice monotherapy in pretreated DLBCL.
*   **Etoposide in DLBCL:**
    *   Etoposide is a cytotoxic agent used in DLBCL treatment, often within combination regimens like R-CHOEP or DA-EPOCH.
    *   High-dose etoposide has been explored in stem cell mobilization followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) for refractory DLBCL.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",19255334,"Based on the search results, it's difficult to pinpoint a single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of rituximab monotherapy *compared to observation* in CLL. Here's a breakdown of why and some potentially relevant options:

*   **Rituximab is often used in combination:** Many studies focus on rituximab combined with other therapies (chemotherapy, targeted agents) rather than as a single agent compared to observation.
*   **Evolution of treatment:** Rituximab monotherapy was explored earlier in CLL treatment. Current standards often involve combination approaches or targeted therapies, so direct comparisons to observation alone might be less common in recent literature.
*   **Maintenance therapy:** Some studies examine rituximab *maintenance* after initial treatment, comparing it to observation. This isn't quite the same as monotherapy vs. observation from the outset.

Considering these factors, here are some options and why they might be relevant:

1.  **Rituximab maintenance versus observation alone...AGMT CLL-8a Mabtenance randomized trial:** (PMID: Not directly retrievable from search, but the text mentions ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01118234)

While not monotherapy vs. observation initially, it addresses the question of rituximab's benefit compared to observation in managing CLL.
    *   It found significantly longer progression-free survival with rituximab maintenance.

    *   It also references single-agent rituximab studies with previously untreated patients, showing response rates, though it doesn't directly compare to observation.

3.  **Other Considerations**

    *   Keep in mind that studies on rituximab *monotherapy* might be older, as treatment approaches have evolved. Newer studies are more likely to investigate rituximab in combination with targeted therapies.

Given the difficulty in finding a *direct* comparison of rituximab monotherapy *versus* observation in *current* practice, the maintenance therapy study (AGMT CLL-8a) might be the most relevant, even if it's not exactly what you initially asked for. To get a precise PubMed ID, I would recommend searching PubMed directly for ""AGMT CLL-8a"" or ""rituximab maintenance CLL"".

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Observation compared to Whole brain irradiation when used to treat Small cell lung cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",17699816,"Based on the information gathered, it's challenging to pinpoint a single ""best"" paper that definitively describes the efficacy of observation compared to whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Here's a breakdown of relevant findings and considerations:

**Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) vs. Observation:**

*   A meta-analysis (Auperin et al.) found that PCI improved overall survival (OS) compared to observation.
*   However, a more recent Japanese phase III trial (Takahashi et al., Lancet Oncol 2017) indicated a detrimental effect of PCI on median OS when rigid brain imaging was applied. This suggests that earlier trials might have shown a benefit for PCI because they inadvertently treated undetected brain metastases.
*   Several studies suggest PCI reduces the risk of brain metastases.

**Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) vs. WBRT:**

*   The FIRE-SCLC study (Rusthoven et al., JAMA Oncology 2020) is a large retrospective analysis that compared first-line SRS to WBRT for brain metastases from SCLC. It found that WBRT was associated with superior time to central nervous system progression, but there was no overall survival advantage compared to SRS. In some analyses, survival outcomes were slightly better with SRS.
*   The FIRE-SCLC study indicated that SRS might be a reasonable alternative to WBRT, but selection bias could influence the results.

**WBRT vs. Teniposide Alone:**

*   A phase III study (EORTC Lung Cancer Cooperative Group) compared teniposide with or without WBRT for SCLC patients with brain metastases. The study found that adding WBRT to teniposide resulted in a much higher response rate of brain metastases and a longer time to progression of brain metastases than teniposide alone. However, overall survival in both groups was poor and not significantly different.

**Key Considerations:**

*   SCLC was often excluded from trials that established SRS as a preferred treatment for brain metastases from other cancers.
*   The role of PCI is evolving, with modern imaging potentially changing the risk-benefit ratio.
*   Many studies are retrospective, which introduces potential biases.

Given the nuances and lack of definitive, high-level evidence (like a large, randomized controlled trial directly comparing observation and WBRT in the modern era with robust imaging), it's difficult to select one paper as the ""best.""

Based on the search results, I would recommend considering the **FIRE-SCLC study (Rusthoven et al., JAMA Oncology 2020)**, as it is the largest analysis of outcomes with first-line SRS for SCLC, and it directly compares SRS to WBRT. However, be mindful of its retrospective nature. I am unable to provide a pmid as it was not present in the search results.

However, here's a breakdown of relevant findings and potential papers to investigate:

**Key Findings & Considerations:**

*   **Rituximab/Hyaluronidase is Typically Compared to IV Rituximab:** The primary comparison in many studies is between subcutaneous rituximab with hyaluronidase (Rituxan Hycela) and intravenous rituximab (Rituxan). The goal is often to demonstrate non-inferiority (similar efficacy) with the subcutaneous formulation offering convenience.
*   **Monotherapy vs. Combination:** Many studies involve rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. Finding studies isolating *monotherapy* comparisons is more difficult.
*   **Efficacy is Often Similar:** Studies often show comparable outcomes (response rates, progression-free survival) between subcutaneous rituximab/hyaluronidase and IV rituximab when used for approved indications, including follicular lymphoma.

**Potential Papers & Search Strategies:**

Given the above, here's how to approach finding the most relevant information:

1.  **""Subcutaneous Rituximab in Follicular Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma""**: Both the PubMed abstract \[1] and the PMC full text \[4] are relevant. This paper discusses rituximab and hyaluronidase human as a subcutaneous formulation approved for follicular lymphoma. It mentions data supporting non-inferior pharmacokinetics and similar outcomes compared to IV rituximab. Examine this paper and its references. It may contain the direct comparison you are looking for.
2.  **Look for Studies Comparing Subcutaneous Rituximab/Hyaluronidase to IV Rituximab Monotherapy:** Focus your search on studies that specifically investigate *monotherapy* regimens. Some studies might include arms that used rituximab monotherapy.
3.  **""Rituximab Monotherapy for Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma: Which Approach Is Better?""** \[10]: This NEJM Journal Watch summary discusses a phase 3 trial comparing subcutaneous vs. IV rituximab monotherapy in previously untreated follicular lymphoma with low tumor burden. It reports significantly better progression-free survival and overall response rates with subcutaneous rituximab. *This is probably the closest to what you are looking for*. Find the original paper by Cartron et al. in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

**Therefore, based on the available information, the most relevant paper to investigate further is likely the one summarized in \[10]: the phase 3 trial by Cartron et al. comparing subcutaneous and IV rituximab monotherapy in previously untreated follicular lymphoma. Once you find the PubMed ID for that specific article, it will be your answer.**

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",20361253,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin monotherapy compared to observation in breast cancer, as most studies focus on comparing it to other treatments rather than a direct observation arm. However, here's a breakdown of potentially relevant papers and why they might be suitable, along with their implied PubMed IDs (if available from the snippets):

**Potentially Relevant Papers (based on the search and their focus):**

1.  **""Single-agent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer: results of an Austrian observational trial""**: This study (if retrievable with a PMID) is an *observational* trial, which is closer to what you're asking. It describes the efficacy (response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival) of PLD monotherapy in a real-world setting of pre-treated metastatic breast cancer patients. While it doesn't have a direct ""observation"" control arm, it provides efficacy data on PLD alone.
    *   **Implied focus:** Efficacy of PLD monotherapy in advanced breast cancer in a real-world observational setting.
    *   If you can find this paper, it's likely to be the closest to your request.

2.  **""Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Duomeisu®) monotherapy in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer heavily pretreated with anthracycline and taxanes: a single-arm, phase II study""**: While this is a *single-arm* study (no direct comparison group), it assesses the efficacy and safety of PLD monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients.
    *   **Implied focus:** Efficacy and safety of PLD monotherapy in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (single arm study).

3.  **""Efficacy and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer""**: This article compares PLD to epirubicin.

4.  **""Efficacy and Cardiotoxicity of Liposomal Doxorubicin-Based Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Ten Randomized Controlled Trials""**: This article is a meta-analysis, so it is a good overview of the efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin.

**Therefore, the best approach is to first try to find the pubmed ID of the first paper mentioned, ""Single-agent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer: results of an Austrian observational trial"".**

*   **Ibrutinib Monotherapy vs. Ibrutinib + Rituximab:**

    *   In a randomized trial (PMC6366726), the addition of rituximab to ibrutinib in relapsed and treatment-naive high-risk CLL patients *failed to show improvement in PFS.*  However, the combination led to faster remissions and significantly lower residual disease levels. The study concludes that ibrutinib monotherapy remains a standard of care.

    *   The ALLIANCE trial (PMC8076207) also found *no difference in PFS at 2 years* between ibrutinib plus rituximab and ibrutinib monotherapy.

*   **Ibrutinib Monotherapy vs. Ibrutinib + Ublituximab:**

    *   The GENUINE phase 3 study (PMC6366726, 2020-05-29 and Cancer Network) evaluated ublituximab plus ibrutinib versus ibrutinib alone in patients with *high-risk relapsed/refractory CLL*.

    *   One study (PMC8076207) indicates significantly higher ORR with ublituximab plus ibrutinib compared to single-agent ibrutinib (83% vs. 65%; P=0.02).

    *   TG Therapeutics (2020-05-29) announced that the addition of ublituximab to ibrutinib significantly improved ORR compared to ibrutinib monotherapy (93% vs 78%; p<0.01).

    *   Another study (Cancer Network) also stated that the combination of ublituximab plus ibrutinib resulted in a higher overall response rate and a tolerable safety profile for patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk CLL.

Given the available information, the GENUINE phase 3 study appears to directly address the comparison of Ibrutinib monotherapy versus Ibrutinib plus Ublituximab in high-risk relapsed/refractory CLL. However, a direct PubMed ID for the primary publication of the GENUINE study isn't explicitly provided in the search snippets.

However, here's a breakdown of relevant information and potential leads:

**Key Considerations from the Search Results:**

*   **Melphalan Dosage:** Several studies focus on comparing different dosages of melphalan (e.g., 140 mg/m² vs. 200 mg/m²) as conditioning regimens prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).
*   **Single vs. Tandem ASCT:** Some studies compare single ASCT with tandem ASCT (two transplants within a short period).
*   **Impact of Novel Therapies:** The role of melphalan and ASCT is also being evaluated in the context of newer multiple myeloma treatments (proteasome inhibitors, IMiDs).

**Potential Relevant Papers & Information:**

*   **CALM Study Analysis (EBMT):** The Collaboration to Collect Autologous Transplant Outcomes in Lymphoma and Myeloma (CALM) study analyzed the efficacy and tolerability of melphalan at 200 mg/m² versus 140 mg/m². It suggests that remission status at the time of transplant might influence whether the higher or lower dose is more beneficial.

*   **Treatment of Multiple Myeloma and the Role of Melphalan in the Era of Modern Therapies:** This review discusses studies comparing single and tandem ASCT with melphalan conditioning. It also mentions a study comparing melphalan and ASCT to melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide (MPR), favoring melphalan and ASCT.

*   **Efficacy and safety of second salvage autologous transplantation in myeloma patients:** This paper discusses using melphalan in second auto-SCT, but not comparing it to tandem melphalan strategies.

*   **HemOnc.org Wiki:** Mentions ""Tandem melphalan, then auto HSCT"" and cites a relevant paper: *J Clin Oncol. 2021 Nov 10;39(32):3613-3622.* and *N Engl J Med. 2022 Jul 14;387(2):132-147.*

**To find the ""best"" paper, you may need to:**

1.  **Refine your search:** Use more specific keywords in PubMed, such as ""tandem auto transplant melphalan multiple myeloma randomized trial"".
2.  **Review cited articles:** Look for the original research articles cited in the review articles.
3.  **Consider publication dates:** Prioritize more recent publications to account for advances in treatment.

    *   **PubMed ID:** The publication date in the snippet (2020-03-15) suggests you can find it on PubMed using a search for those terms and the date.

**3. For neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX in rectal cancer:**

*   **Title:** ""Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX Improves Disease Control in Advanced Rectal Cancer""

    *   **Why it's relevant:** This article (result \[4]) discusses the use of neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX (given before surgery and chemoradiotherapy) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. It showed improved disease-free survival compared to standard care.

*   One relevant study is a phase III trial comparing oral topotecan/intravenous cisplatin (TC) with intravenous etoposide/cisplatin (PE) in patients with untreated extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). The study concluded that oral topotecan with cisplatin provides similar efficacy and tolerability to the standard (etoposide with cisplatin) in untreated ED-SCLC and may provide greater patient convenience compared with intravenous etoposide and cisplatin.
*   Another phase III study compared topotecan-cisplatin (TP) versus cisplatin-etoposide (PE) in chemo-naive extensive disease small-cell lung cancer patients. The study concluded that TP is noninferior to PE in overall survival and superior in time to progression and overall response rates.

It's important to note that ""noninferior"" doesn't necessarily mean ""equal."" It means that the new treatment (in this case, cisplatin and topotecan) is not substantially worse than the standard treatment (cisplatin and etoposide).

To provide a specific PubMed ID, I'll focus on the study that directly compares the two regimens. One such study is:

*   **eBEACOPP Superior in Some Cases:** Several studies, including the HD15 trial and a meta-analysis, suggest eBEACOPP may offer a survival benefit compared to ABVD in advanced-stage HL. The meta-analysis indicated a statistically significant survival benefit of 7% with eBEACOPP.
*   **Toxicity Considerations:** eBEACOPP is generally associated with higher toxicity than ABVD. Studies have focused on de-escalating strategies to reduce these toxicities.
*   **PET-Adapted Approaches:** Interim PET scans play a role in treatment decisions. Patients with positive PET scans after ABVD may be escalated to eBEACOPP. Some trials start with eBEACOPP and de-escalate to ABVD based on PET results.
*   **No Significant Difference in Some Studies:** The GHSG HD18 study showed no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) following four cycles of eBEACOPP compared to six or eight cycles in an interim PET-adapted design.
*   **ABVD as Effective Option:** One study confirms that ABVD is an effective and less toxic option for advanced-stage HL, although eBEACOPP may provide better initial disease control and prolonged time-to-relapse.
*   **Chinese Study:** A recent study (PMID: 39206988) comparing ABVD and standard BEACOPP found similar objective response rates but significant differences in the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, with ABVD being better tolerated.

Considering the prompt, it is difficult to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy. However, here are a few options with their PubMed IDs that directly address the comparison:

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of No induction compared to DCF when used to treat Head and neck cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",28911070,"Based on the information I found, it's difficult to pinpoint a single paper with a PubMed ID that *best* describes the efficacy of no induction compared to DCF (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, 5-Fluorouracil) for head and neck cancer. This is because studies often compare DCF induction to other induction regimens (like PF) or to concurrent chemoradiation *without* induction.

However, here's what I can tell you, along with some potentially relevant PubMed IDs to investigate further:

*   **DCF vs. Other Induction Regimens:** Some studies compare DCF to older induction regimens like cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF). The goal is often to see if DCF improves response rates or survival compared to these older approaches.

*   **Induction vs. No Induction (Concurrent Chemoradiation):** Many trials investigate whether adding *any* induction chemotherapy (including DCF) before concurrent chemoradiation improves outcomes compared to chemoradiation alone. The value of induction chemotherapy, in general, is still debated.

Given the complexity, I recommend looking at these resources and possibly using them to find more specific papers:

*   **[4] The Slippery Role of Induction Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer: Myth and Reality** This review discusses the debate around induction chemotherapy and mentions trials comparing induction (including TPF/DCF) to concurrent chemoradiation. It references several key trials with PubMed IDs that you could explore.

*   **[6] Induction Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Question of Belief** This article also discusses the ongoing debate.

*   **[11] The Effect of Induction Chemotherapy Using Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Fluorouracil on Survival in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis** This meta-analysis might provide a broader overview, although it focuses on DCF specifically *followed by* chemoradiation versus chemoradiation alone.

To find a *specific* study that isolates ""no induction"" versus ""DCF induction"", you might need to perform a more targeted search on PubMed, focusing on keywords like:

*   `head and neck cancer induction chemotherapy DCF efficacy`
*   `head and neck cancer concurrent chemoradiation vs DCF induction`
*   `HNSCC no induction vs TPF` (TPF is often used interchangeably with DCF in this context).

*   **Emicizumab is generally superior to observation:** Multiple sources indicate that emicizumab prophylaxis is more effective in preventing bleeding episodes than observation or on-demand treatment, especially in severe hemophilia A.
*   **Ethical considerations:** It would be unethical to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled trial directly comparing emicizumab to a strict ""observation only"" approach in individuals with severe inherited coagulopathies, as this would leave patients at high risk for bleeds and complications.

However, some relevant findings regarding Rituximab in DLBCL:

*   **Rituximab monotherapy activity:** Studies have shown Rituximab monotherapy has activity in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, with overall response rates around 37% and some complete responses.

*   **R-CHOP as standard:** The combination of Rituximab with CHOP chemotherapy (R-CHOP) is the standard first-line treatment for DLBCL. Multiple studies have demonstrated that R-CHOP is superior to CHOP alone, leading to improved survival rates.

*   **Maintenance therapy:** Some trials have investigated Rituximab maintenance therapy after initial treatment with R-CHOP, but the results are mixed. Some show improved progression-free survival, while others don't show a significant overall survival benefit.

*   **Salvage therapy:** Rituximab is also used in salvage therapy for relapsed or refractory DLBCL, often in combination with other chemotherapy regimens.

**Papers Discussing Erlotinib Monotherapy Efficacy:**

*   **PubMed ID: 21967156** - ""Erlotinib monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of non-small cell lung cancer after previous platinum-containing chemotherapy: a NICE single technology appraisal."" This article assesses the clinical and cost-effectiveness of erlotinib monotherapy as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy. It notes a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with stable disease. However, it also mentions no significant difference in OS in a subgroup analysis of patients with non-squamous disease.

*   **PubMed Central (no ID given in snippet, link provided)** - ""Observational study on the efficacy and safety of erlotinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer"". This study evaluates erlotinib's efficacy and safety in a real-world setting. It reports tumor response and disease control rates, as well as median time to treatment failure and survival time. The study finds that survival was significantly prolonged in EGFR mutation-positive patients.

*   **Abstract (PubMed ID unavailable from snippet):** ""[Efficacy and safety of erlotinib as monotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer]"" This study of 50 patients with advanced NSCLC found an overall survival (OS) of 21.8 months and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.0 months with erlotinib monotherapy. It also found that patients with EGFR gene mutations had better objective response rates and PFS.

**Why choosing a ""best"" paper is difficult:**

*   **Observation as a Comparator:** Many studies compare erlotinib to *other treatments* (like chemotherapy or other targeted therapies) or to placebo, rather than to *observation* alone.
*   **Specific Patient Populations:** The efficacy of erlotinib varies depending on factors like EGFR mutation status, prior treatments, and other patient characteristics.
*   **Study Design:** Observational studies provide real-world data but may have limitations compared to randomized controlled trials.

    *   While this trial doesn't directly compare COPADM *to* R-COPADM, it provides a baseline for the COPADM regimen and discusses treatment reduction strategies. It's a relevant paper for understanding the evolution of treatment approaches.

*   **Rituximab's Addition:** The studies suggest that adding rituximab (R) to chemotherapy regimens like COPADM has improved outcomes, especially in Burkitt lymphoma.

The efficacy of ICL (presumably meaning a chemotherapy regimen including cytarabine and idarubicin) compared to ""7+3"" (standard cytarabine and anthracycline) in AML treatment is complex and depends on patient characteristics and specific AML subtypes.
Here's a breakdown of relevant information from the search results, which suggests several avenues for further investigation:

*   **CPX-351 (Liposomal Cytarabine and Daunorubicin) vs. 7+3:** Several sources ([4], [5], [7]) discuss CPX-351, a liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin, compared to 7+3. CPX-351 has shown improved overall survival in older patients with secondary AML (AML-MRC or t-AML). One study ([5]) suggests that the benefit of CPX-351 over 7+3 is primarily seen in patients with AML-MR mutations.
*   **Idarubicin vs. Daunorubicin in 7+3:** One source ([6]) discusses studies comparing idarubicin to daunorubicin (both anthracyclines used in the ""7+3"" backbone). Some studies suggest idarubicin may lead to improved complete remission rates and overall survival compared to daunorubicin, particularly in younger patients.
*   **Venetoclax and HMA vs. 7+3:** One study ([3]) compares venetoclax and hypomethylating agent (HMA) to 7+3. It found that while patients selected for intensive chemotherapy (7+3) had superior overall survival in a real-world dataset, a subgroup had similar outcomes with venetoclax/HMA.
*   **Role of MRD:** One article ([2]) highlights the importance of measurable residual disease (MRD) in assessing prognosis and guiding treatment decisions in AML.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to provide a specific PubMed ID. To find the most relevant paper, I recommend refining your search with more specific keywords related to:

*   **Specific AML subtypes:** e.g., ""AML with FLT3 mutation,"" ""TP53-mutated AML,"" ""secondary AML.""
*   **Patient age:** e.g., ""older adults,"" ""young adults.""
*   **Specific outcomes of interest:** e.g., ""overall survival,"" ""complete remission rate,"" ""relapse-free survival.""

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Observation compared to TACE monotherapy when used to treat Hepatocellular carcinoma.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",29420221,"Based on the search results, identifying a single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of observation compared to TACE monotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult. Here's why, and what the results indicate:

*   **Limited Direct Comparison:** The primary focus in recent research is on comparing TACE monotherapy to TACE in combination with other treatments (like lenvatinib, sorafenib, or SBRT). Direct comparisons of observation *versus* TACE alone are less common in the studies retrieved.
*   **TACE vs. Observation is often Stage-Dependent:** The decision to use TACE or observation often depends on the stage and characteristics of the HCC, as well as patient-specific factors.

Given these limitations, I can't provide a single ""best"" PubMed ID for a paper directly comparing observation to TACE. However, the search results suggest that TACE, particularly in combination with other therapies, generally shows better outcomes than TACE alone in many scenarios.

It's important to note that guidelines generally recommend TACE for intermediate-stage HCC (BCLC stage B). Observation might be considered in specific cases (e.g., very early-stage HCC unsuitable for other treatments or when TACE is contraindicated).

However, here's a summary of findings related to rituximab monotherapy versus observation in DLBCL, along with some potentially relevant publications. Note that many studies focus on rituximab in combination with chemotherapy (R-CHOP) rather than monotherapy.

*   **Rituximab Monotherapy Activity:** Several sources mention that rituximab monotherapy does have activity in DLBCL, particularly in relapsed/refractory settings or as maintenance therapy. However, it is generally not considered the standard first-line treatment.
*   **Maintenance Therapy:** Some studies have looked at rituximab maintenance after initial treatment with R-CHOP. The results are mixed, with some showing improved progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS).
*   **Comparison to Observation:** The results of NHL-13 trial showed no difference in the primary end point of EFS after a median follow-up of 45 months; however, PFS was significantly improved in the maintenance therapy arm relative to the observation arm.

Given the information, it's difficult to pinpoint one single ""best"" paper directly comparing rituximab monotherapy to observation in *newly diagnosed* DLBCL. The NHL-13 trial mentioned in the search results compares rituximab maintenance therapy to observation in patients who have already responded to R-CHOP.

*   **Similar Efficacy:** A randomized phase III clinical trial by Pectasides et al. (2015) found no significant differences in efficacy between FOLFOX and CAPOX as adjuvant treatment in high-risk stage II or stage III colorectal cancer patients. Both regimens had comparable 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates.

*   **CAPOX Preference in Older Patients:** A retrospective study found that while there was no significant difference in overall survival rate between CAPOX and FOLFOX, disease progression, metastasis, and mortality rates were significantly higher in the FOLFOX arm. The CAPOX regimen was preferred in older patients.

*   **XELOX (CAPOX) as a Preferred Option:** A meta-analysis concluded that the XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimen had better overall and disease-free survival compared to other adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFOX, for stage III colon cancer after surgery.

*   **Tolerability:** One study found that FOLFOX was better tolerated than CAPOX, with a higher percentage of patients completing the full intended duration of chemotherapy.

However, here's a breakdown of relevant findings and potential papers to investigate further:

**Key Findings & Relevant Studies:**

*   **Durvalumab Monotherapy Limitations:** Several sources ([5, 9]) indicate that durvalumab monotherapy has limitations in improving overall survival (OS) in metastatic NSCLC, particularly compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in certain populations.
*   **PEARL Trial:** The phase III PEARL trial ([5, 9]) showed that durvalumab monotherapy did not significantly improve OS in patients with stage IV NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression (≥25%) compared to platinum-based chemotherapy.
*   **Durvalumab in Combination:** Durvalumab is more frequently used and shows better results in combination with chemotherapy (e.g., carboplatin and paclitaxel) and/or other immunotherapies.
*   **POSEIDON Study:** The phase III POSEIDON trial ([14, 17]) evaluated durvalumab plus chemotherapy (D+CT) versus chemotherapy alone (CT) in metastatic NSCLC. While D+CT showed improved progression-free survival (PFS), the improvement in overall survival (OS) was not statistically significant. The addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab and chemotherapy (T+D+CT) did show statistically significant improvements in both PFS and OS compared to chemotherapy alone. Chemotherapy options included carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel.

**Potential Papers to Investigate Further (PubMed IDs):**

Given the above, directly comparing CP to Durvalumab monotherapy is difficult based on the provided context. A relevant comparison point would involve studies looking at Durvalumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy. It would be useful to research studies on these topics.

    *   However, exploratory analyses suggested a blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) threshold of ≥20 mutations per megabase might identify patients who benefit from durvalumab plus tremelimumab.
    *   Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were less frequent with durvalumab alone compared to chemotherapy, and also less frequent compared to the durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination.

It's important to note that other studies, like the CASPIAN trial (though focused on small cell lung cancer), explore durvalumab and tremelimumab in *combination* with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the TRITON study (NCT06008093) is actively recruiting and comparing durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy versus pembrolizumab with chemotherapy specifically in NSCLC patients with STK11, KEAP1, or KRAS mutations.

Therefore, based on the criteria of directly comparing platinum doublet to durvalumab and tremelimumab, the MYSTIC trial appears to be the most relevant.

The main issue is that observation alone isn't typically a standard comparison; instead, bortezomib monotherapy is often compared to other active treatments like high-dose dexamethasone. However, I can provide some relevant information and links to potentially useful papers:

*   **Bortezomib vs. High-Dose Dexamethasone:** Several papers compare bortezomib monotherapy to high-dose dexamethasone (HDD) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. For instance, the NICE guidance ([1] in the search results) references an RCT suggesting bortezomib increases survival and time to disease progression compared to HDD. It also mentions a cost-effectiveness analysis. Another paper states that bortezomib monotherapy is more effective than high-dose dexamethasone, with a better ORR, TTP, and 1-year OS ([4] in the search results).

*   **Bortezomib Monotherapy vs. Bortezomib-Based Combinations:** Some studies compare bortezomib alone to bortezomib in combination with other drugs. While not a direct comparison to observation, they provide context on the efficacy of bortezomib monotherapy. One retrospective analysis found that bortezomib plus dexamethasone had a significantly higher overall response rate and longer time-to-progression compared to bortezomib monotherapy.

Several sources suggest that CapeOx and FOLFOX4 have similar efficacy in treating colorectal cancer, but may differ in their toxicity profiles and administration:

*   **Meta-analyses:** Some meta-analyses (like the one mentioned in result \[3] and \[8]) conclude that XELOX (CapeOx) has similar efficacy to FOLFOX in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in terms of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR). However, XELOX may have a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, hand-foot syndrome, and diarrhea, while FOLFOX might have a higher incidence of neutropenia.
*   **IDEA Study & Related Analyses:** The IDEA study (mentioned in result \[1] and \[4]) and its related analyses suggest that the duration of adjuvant therapy (3 months vs. 6 months) can be individualized based on the specific chemotherapy regimen (CapeOx or FOLFOX) and patient risk factors. For CAPOX, 3-month therapy may be as effective as 6-month therapy, especially in low-risk patients.
*   **Retrospective Studies:** Result \[14] mentions a retrospective study that found higher disease progression, metastasis, and mortality rates in the FOLFOX arm compared to the CAPOX arm, with no significant difference in overall survival. However, the CAPOX group was significantly older, which could be a confounding factor.
*   **Comparative Studies with Cetuximab:** Result \[13] suggests that CAPEOX combined with cetuximab is an equally viable option for first-line treatment of RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC as FOLFOX combined with cetuximab.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",36183733,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint a single ""best"" paper directly comparing exemestane/palbociclib versus fulvestrant/palbociclib. Several studies explore these combinations, but often within specific contexts or comparing them to other treatments. Here's a breakdown of relevant findings and potential papers:

*   **Young-PEARL Study (Exemestane/Palbociclib vs. Capecitabine):** Several results ([1], [2], [7]) refer to the Young-PEARL study. This study compared exemestane plus palbociclib with ovarian function suppression to capecitabine in *premenopausal* women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. While not directly comparing to fulvestrant/palbociclib, it provides efficacy data for the exemestane/palbociclib combination in a specific population.
    *   Updated results (2024) showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) with exemestane/palbociclib compared to capecitabine, but no overall survival (OS) benefit.

*   **INAVO120 Study (Inavolisib + Palbociclib/Fulvestrant):** Result [3] discusses the INAVO120 study, which evaluated inavolisib in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant in patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. This study does *not* directly compare exemestane/palbociclib and fulvestrant/palbociclib, but it provides data on the efficacy of fulvestrant/palbociclib when combined with inavolisib.

*   **Retrospective Analysis (Everolimus/Exemestane vs. Palbociclib/Fulvestrant):** Results \[4] and \[8] describe a retrospective study comparing everolimus/exemestane (EVE-EXE) to palbociclib/fulvestrant (PALBO-FUL) in pretreated advanced breast cancer with lobular histotype.
    *   This study found longer PFS with EVE-EXE compared to PALBO-FUL, suggesting a potentially more effective sequence in this specific subgroup.
    *   It is important to note that this is a *retrospective* analysis, so the conclusions are not as strong as those from a prospective, randomized trial.

*   **Real-World Studies of Palbociclib/Fulvestrant:** Results \[5], \[10], and \[12] discuss real-world effectiveness of palbociclib plus fulvestrant. These studies suggest that the combination is effective in real-world settings but may have lower effectiveness than reported in clinical trials. These do not offer a comparison to exemestane/palbociclib.

*   **PARSIFAL Trial (Palbociclib + Fulvestrant vs. Letrozole):** Result \[13] mentions the PARSIFAL study, which compared palbociclib with either letrozole or fulvestrant as initial treatment. The study found no improvement in PFS with fulvestrant-palbociclib over letrozole-palbociclib. This doesn't directly address the exemestane comparison, but it does inform the choice of endocrine partner with palbociclib.

*   **Cross-line CDK4/6 Inhibitor Therapy:** Result \[14] mentions the PALOMA-3 trial, which compared fulvestrant plus palbociclib versus fulvestrant plus placebo after progression on previous endocrine therapy.

**In summary:**

A direct head-to-head comparison of exemestane/palbociclib and fulvestrant/palbociclib doesn't appear explicitly in these search results. The choice between these combinations likely depends on the patient's menopausal status, prior treatments, and other clinical factors.

Given the available information, the study that *most closely* addresses the question, although indirectly, is the retrospective analysis comparing Everolimus/Exemestane vs. Palbociclib/Fulvestrant \[4, 8]. However, it's crucial to recognize its limitations as a retrospective study focused on a specific breast cancer subtype.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",33369355,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint one single paper that *perfectly* and comprehensively describes the efficacy of observation versus azacitidine oral monotherapy in AML. It is difficult to provide a single, definitive PubMed ID for a paper directly comparing observation to azacitidine oral monotherapy in AML. Here's why, and what the search reveals:

*   **Observation Alone is Less Common:** True ""observation"" (i.e., active surveillance without immediate treatment) is less frequently a primary treatment strategy in AML, especially when active treatments like azacitidine are available. It's more common in situations where patients are very frail or have other contraindications.

*   **Azacitidine (Oral) vs. Placebo/Supportive Care:** Studies often compare azacitidine to placebo or best supportive care (BSC), which serves as a proxy for observation in some ways.

Given these limitations, here's the most relevant information and potential avenues for finding something closer to your needs:

1.  **Azacitidine vs. Best Supportive Care:**

    *   Several sources mention studies comparing azacitidine to best supportive care (BSC) in AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. BSC can be considered a form of observation in some contexts.
    *   For example, one article mentions that CALGB (Cancer and Leukemia Group B) conducted trials comparing azacitidine (AZA) to BSC, showing higher response rates and prolonged time to AML transformation/death with AZA.

2.  **Oral Azacitidine Trials (vs. Placebo):**

    *   The QUAZAR AML-001 trial is a key study. It compared oral azacitidine to placebo in AML patients in remission after intensive chemotherapy. While it's not *directly* observation vs. azacitidine as initial therapy, the placebo arm provides a comparison to a no-treatment maintenance approach.

This could be useful in comparing to a ""watch and wait"" approach.

**Therefore, I recommend exploring these options to find the most relevant paper:**

*   **Search PubMed Directly:** Use search terms like: ""acute myeloid leukemia"" AND ""azacitidine"" AND ""best supportive care"" OR ""observation"".
*   **QUAZAR AML-001 Trial:** Find the primary publication for this trial. While it's azacitidine *maintenance* vs. placebo, it provides insight into azacitidine's benefit after remission compared to no treatment.
*   **Consider Retrospective Studies:** Look for retrospective studies that analyze outcomes of patients treated with azacitidine monotherapy versus those who received only supportive care (carefully consider the patient populations).

If you can refine your search based on specific patient populations (e.g., very elderly, specific genetic mutations), you might find more targeted comparisons.

Here's why and a breakdown of relevant findings:

*   **R-CHOP vs. CHOP is well-established:** The addition of rituximab (R) to CHOP chemotherapy is a proven improvement. Many studies focus on R-CHOP-14 vs. R-CHOP-21 (where the number indicates the cycle length in days) rather than directly comparing R-CHOP-14 to CHOP-14.
*   **R-CHOP-14 vs. R-CHOP-21 is more common:** The key question has become whether shortening the cycle length to 14 days (R-CHOP-14) provides additional benefit compared to the standard 21-day cycle (R-CHOP-21).
*   **No definitive superiority:** Several studies suggest that R-CHOP-14 and R-CHOP-21 have comparable efficacy. Some studies suggest R-CHOP-14 may be more favorable, but this may be population specific.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",25185099,"Based on the search results, here's a breakdown of the relevant information and a potential answer:

**Key Considerations:**

*   **ROSE/TRIO-012 Trial:** A significant study (PMID: 25578885) investigated adding ramucirumab to docetaxel for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. It found that the addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel did not meaningfully improve clinical outcomes (Progression Free Survival or Overall Survival).

*   **Docetaxel Monotherapy Efficacy:** Several sources ([1], [5], [8], [9]) highlight the established efficacy of docetaxel monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer, particularly in patients who have received prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
*   **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Studies:** Some results ([7], [10], [11], [13], [15]) discuss docetaxel and ramucirumab in NSCLC, but this isn't directly relevant to breast cancer. However, they do provide context on the use of this combination in other cancers.

A comprehensive answer would require a deeper dive into the available literature on PubMed. However, I can guide you on how to find relevant papers and provide some context.

Here's how you can search on PubMed to find the most relevant paper for your needs:

1.  **PubMed Search Strategy:** Go to the PubMed website ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)). Use the following search terms, combining them as needed:

    *   ""Fulvestrant""
    *   ""Taselisib""
    *   ""Breast Neoplasms"" or ""Breast Cancer""
    *   ""Monotherapy""
    *   ""Drug Therapy, Combination"" (to find studies comparing the combination to monotherapy)
    *   ""Clinical Trial""
    *   ""Efficacy""
    *   ""Randomized Controlled Trial"" (to prioritize higher-quality evidence)

2.  **Filters:** After running your search, use the filters on the left side of the screen to narrow your results. Useful filters include:

    *   **Publication date:** Limit to the most recent years for the most up-to-date information.
    *   **Article type:** Select ""Clinical Trial,"" ""Meta-Analysis,"" or ""Randomized Controlled Trial"" for stronger evidence.
    *   **Species:** ""Humans""

3.  **Reviewing Results:** Carefully examine the titles and abstracts of the search results. Look for studies that directly compare fulvestrant monotherapy to the combination of taselisib and fulvestrant in breast cancer patients. Pay attention to the study design, patient population, and the specific outcomes measured (e.g., progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate).

4.  **Identifying the ""Best"" Paper:** The ""best"" paper depends on your specific needs. Consider these factors:

    *   **Study design:** Randomized controlled trials generally provide the strongest evidence.
    *   **Sample size:** Larger studies are generally more reliable.
    *   **Patient population:** Does the study population match the characteristics of the patients you are interested in?
    *   **Outcomes measured:** Does the study report on the outcomes that are most important to you?

Once you have identified the paper that best meets your criteria, you can extract the PMID (PubMed Identifier) from the PubMed record. The PMID is a unique numerical identifier for each PubMed entry.

However, I can provide some relevant information and potential leads based on the search results:

*   **Regarding Observation vs. Chemotherapy (including Adriamycin, a component similar to API):** Several studies compare observation to adjuvant chemotherapy (often including Adriamycin) in early-stage uterine leiomyosarcoma. These studies often find no significant benefit of chemotherapy over observation in terms of overall recurrence rate or survival.

    *   A GOG study ([3]) evaluating Adriamycin in the adjuvant setting for stage I/II uterine sarcomas (including leiomyosarcoma) showed no improvement in PFS or OS with Adriamycin compared to observation.
*   **Regarding API regimens:** The role of adjuvant API (doxorubicin, ifosfamide, cisplatin) is discussed in some sources.
    *   One study ([3]) examined API combined with radiation therapy versus radiation therapy alone in uterine sarcomas (including leiomyosarcoma). While there was improved 3-year disease-free survival in the combined arm, there was no improvement in 3-year overall survival, and increased toxicity.
*   **Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors:** Some studies discuss the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as pazopanib in treating leiomyosarcoma.
*   **Limitations:** It's important to note that leiomyosarcoma is a rare and heterogeneous disease, making definitive comparative studies challenging. Many studies include various subtypes of sarcoma, which can make it difficult to draw specific conclusions about leiomyosarcoma.

Given the information available, it's difficult to pinpoint one specific paper with a direct comparison. However, the systematic review and meta-analysis ([1]) might be a good starting point, as it summarizes data from multiple studies comparing adjuvant chemotherapy (which may include agents similar to those in API regimens) to observation.

*   **Equivalence Studies:** The goal of biosimilar studies is to show that the biosimilar has comparable efficacy and safety to the reference product (Herceptin).

Given this context, here's the most relevant information I can provide:

*   **SB3-G31-BC Trial:** I found a study mentioned in the search results (Pivot et al. 2018 (SB3-G31-BC)) that directly compares TH-FEC + H (with trastuzumab-dttb) to TH-FEC + H (likely with the original trastuzumab). This study aimed to demonstrate the equivalent pathological complete response (bpCR). The bpCR rate was 42% in the trastuzumab arm vs 51.7% in the trastuzumab-dttb arm.
*   **ONTRUZANT (trastuzumab-dttb) Information:** ONTRUZANT is the brand name for trastuzumab-dttb. The search results mention that its approval was based on rigorous evaluation, including clinical data demonstrating equivalent clinical efficacy to Herceptin (trastuzumab).

**In summary:**

While I don't have a specific PubMed ID for a paper that *perfectly* matches your request, the SB3-G31-BC trial (Pivot et al. 2018) is the closest, as it directly compares the treatment regimens you specified. You would need to search for the PubMed ID of this specific publication. You can search for ""Pivot et al. 2018 SB3-G31-BC"" in PubMed to find the exact PubMed ID.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Stage of Cancer:** Some studies focus on stage III colon cancer, while others examine metastatic colorectal cancer. The optimal regimen may differ based on the stage.
*   **Adjuvant vs. Perioperative:** Some studies examine adjuvant chemotherapy (after surgery), while others study perioperative chemotherapy (before and after surgery).
*   **Toxicity Profiles:** XELOX/CAPOX and FOLFOX have different toxicity profiles. Consider the patient's individual risk factors and preferences when choosing a regimen.
*   **Study Design:** Be aware of the limitations of retrospective studies compared to prospective, randomized controlled trials. Meta-analyses can provide a broader overview but are also subject to limitations based on the included studies.

*   Several sources mention BEAM as a common conditioning regimen before auto-HSCT for lymphoma, including DLBCL.
*   Source \[1] mentions a meta-analysis by Auger-Quittet et al. (2014) looking at Z-BEAM (Zevalin (yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan)) which showed a 2-year OS of 84.5%.
*   Source \[2] compares BEAM and BeEAM regimens, noting comparable toxicity and efficacy, but higher pneumonia incidence with BEAM and higher mucositis with BeEAM. It concludes there's no significant survival difference.

    *   **Potential relevant articles:**

The pubmed ID for the meta-analysis is PMID: 24913788.

**2. Efficacy of BEAM followed by auto-HSCT for DLBCL:**

*   Several sources suggest BEAM with auto-HSCT is a standard approach for relapsed/refractory DLBCL.
*   Source \[8] mentions a CORAL study validating auto-HSCT in the rituximab era, showing a 3-year progression-free survival of 37% and a 3-year overall survival of 49% in patients with R/R DLBCL treated with second-line chemotherapy followed by auto-HSCT.

**3. BEAM vs. other conditioning regimens:**

*   Source \[6] compares BEAM to CLV and LEAM, finding significant interactions between histology, HDT regimen, and outcome. It notes CBV was associated with lower mortality in follicular lymphoma but higher mortality in DLBCL compared to BEAM.

**4. Auto-HSCT vs. CAR-T cell therapy:**

*   Sources \[4] and \[5] present a systematic review indicating that while CAR-T shows better overall response rate (ORR), auto-HSCT demonstrates better long-term overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in R/R DLBCL.  This review analyzes multiple studies.
*   Source \[8] highlights the ZUMA-7 and TRANSFORM studies, which showed superior outcomes with CAR-T (axi-cel and liso-cel, respectively) compared to standard chemoimmunotherapy + auto-HSCT in *early* relapsed/refractory DLBCL.
*  Source [11] is titled ""Comparison of CAR-T19 and autologous stem cell transplantation for refractory/relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"" - This might be of interest, but it's for *non-Hodgkin's lymphoma* generally.

**Recommendation**

Given the prompt's request for the paper that *best describes* the efficacy, the systematic review comparing CAR-T and auto-HSCT (Sources \[4] and \[5]) might be a good starting point, as it synthesizes data from multiple studies. However, since CAR-T therapy is now a major treatment option for DLBCL, the more recent trials such as ZUMA-7 and TRANSFORM (Source \[8]) are also highly relevant for understanding current treatment paradigms.

To choose the ""best"" paper, consider the following:

*   **Scope:** Do you want a broad overview (systematic review) or the results of a specific, influential clinical trial?
*   **Recency:** How important is it to have the latest data?
*   **Specific comparison:** Are you most interested in the CAR-T vs. auto-HSCT comparison, or the nuances of different conditioning regimens like BEAM vs. Z-BEAM?

**Based on the above, I would recommend searching for the PubMed ID of the systematic review:** ""Efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy and autologous stem cell transplant in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A systematic review""

*   **Very Low Risk Wilms Tumor (VLRWT):**
    *   A study in *PubMed Central* ([3]) indicated that for very low-risk Wilms tumor, surgery alone had a lower event-free survival than surgery followed by dactinomycin and vincristine (EE4A). However, overall survival was equivalent due to salvage therapy in the surgery-only group.
    *   Another article ([7]) discusses long-term outcomes for infants with very low-risk Wilms tumor treated with surgery alone in National Wilms Tumor Study-5.

Given the information, here's a possible approach to finding the most relevant paper:

1.  **Focus on SIOP-6 and SIOP-9 trials:** Search specifically for the published papers from these trials to get detailed efficacy data comparing different durations of vincristine/dactinomycin.

    *   Some articles discuss combining systemic chemotherapy (like FOLFOX) with other approaches, such as HIPEC (Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy) in specific situations like peritoneal metastases (PMID: 36198694). However, the ASCO guideline (PMID not available) does *not* recommend adding oxaliplatin-based HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery for colorectal peritoneal metastases.

It is important to note:

*   The efficacy of intraperitoneal 5-FU might be most relevant in cases with peritoneal involvement, rather than as a general replacement for systemic mFOLFOX6.
*   mFOLFOX6 is a systemic treatment, while intraperitoneal 5-FU is a regional approach.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",19720922,"Based on the search results, here's a breakdown of relevant studies and a potential answer:

**Key Studies & Findings:**

*   **Plerixafor and G-CSF vs. Placebo and G-CSF (Blood, 2009):** This phase 3 study (PMID: not explicitly stated in the snippets but can be found using DOI: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-174946) demonstrated that adding plerixafor to G-CSF significantly improved stem cell mobilization in multiple myeloma patients compared to G-CSF alone. More patients in the plerixafor group reached the target CD34+ cell count with fewer apheresis sessions.
*   **Meta-Analysis of Mobilization Regimens (2022):** This study (PMID not found, but the study was published in March 2022) indicated that for NHL patients, G-CSF combined with plerixafor showed similar improvements in HSC mobilization efficacy compared to G-CSF alone.
*   **ID-AraC + G-CSF vs. G-CSF Alone (Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 2019):** (PMID not found, but the study was published on 2019-04-16) This trial indicated that intermediate-dose cytarabine (ID-AraC) plus G-CSF was more effective than G-CSF alone for stem cell mobilization in multiple myeloma patients, leading to a higher stem cell yield.
*   **Meta-analysis (Annals of Medicine, 2024):** This study (PMID not found, but the DOI is: 10.1080/07853890.2024.2329140) suggests that G-CSF and plerixafor resulted in more patients achieving the predetermined apheresis yield of CD34+ cells compared to G-CSF alone in MM, NHL and HL patients.

**Answer:**

While several papers address the efficacy of G-CSF monotherapy versus Plerixafor and G-CSF, the phase 3 study published in *Blood* seems to directly address the question. Since the pmid was not directly given, I will provide the DOI: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-174946 so you can search for the pmid.

"Find/search the pubmed id of the paper that best describes the efficacy of Observation compared to TAC (Docetaxel) when used to treat Breast cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",29860917,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint a single paper that *perfectly* describes the efficacy of ""observation"" compared to TAC (Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide) in breast cancer treatment. This is because observation is typically not compared head-to-head with active chemotherapy regimens like TAC in randomized controlled trials, especially when treatment is indicated.

However, I can provide some relevant information and potential leads:

*   **TAC vs. other Chemotherapy Regimens:** Several studies compare TAC to other chemotherapy regimens like FAC (Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide) or TC (Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide). These studies suggest TAC's superiority in certain contexts.

*   **Role of Observation:** Observation is generally considered after primary treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) to monitor for recurrence. It's not usually an *alternative* to initial treatment when treatment is indicated. In some cases, particularly in early-stage, low-risk cancers, observation might be considered after surgery without adjuvant chemotherapy, but this is a very specific scenario.

*   **NCI Breast Cancer Treatment (PDQ®) Report:** This comprehensive resource discusses treatment options, including systemic therapy for various stages of breast cancer. While it won't directly compare TAC to observation, it provides context on when each approach is considered.

Given the above, finding a direct comparison in a single paper is unlikely. To get a sense of when observation *might* be considered, you could look for studies on:

*   **De-escalation of therapy:** Trials that explore less aggressive treatment approaches in specific patient populations with favorable prognoses.
*   **Minimal residual disease:** Research on monitoring patients after initial treatment to detect early signs of recurrence, where observation plays a key role.

It is important to note that treatment decisions should always be made in consultation with a qualified oncologist, considering individual patient factors and the specific characteristics of the breast cancer.

Most studies investigate lapatinib in combination with other therapies like chemotherapy or other targeted agents. However, some information addresses aspects of your query:

1.  **Lapatinib Monotherapy Activity:**

    *   Several studies assessed lapatinib monotherapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, often in patients who had progressed on prior therapies like trastuzumab. While these studies don't directly compare to a placebo arm, they provide data on the *activity* (or lack thereof) of lapatinib alone.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",29975623,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of observation compared to CVP for follicular lymphoma. The most relevant results point to the following:

*   **The PRIMA study:** This study (PMID not directly available in the snippet, but identifiable as NCT00140582 in ClinicalTrials.gov) established that rituximab maintenance after immunochemotherapy (including R-CVP) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with observation. This suggests that observation alone might not be the optimal strategy *after* initial treatment with R-CVP or similar regimens.
*   **Marcus et al. (2008):** This paper, mentioned in several snippets, compared R-CVP vs. CVP alone, demonstrating the superiority of adding rituximab to CVP. This isn't directly observation vs. CVP, but it highlights the benefit of *adding* an agent to CVP.
*   **A review of various frontline treatment options:** One snippet mentions that management of FL has traditionally included a ""watch-and-wait approach"" *or* chemotherapy. This indicates that observation *is* a valid strategy in certain cases, though the criteria for selecting observation vs. treatment aren't fully elaborated in these snippets.
*   **JCOG2008, MAIN study:** This study (PMID not available in the snippet) aims to confirm the non-inferiority of observation compared to obinutuzumab maintenance therapy after obinutuzumab plus bendamustine induction therapy.

It's important to note:

*   The decision to use observation vs. CVP (or other treatments) depends on the stage, grade, tumor burden, symptoms, and the patient's overall health and preferences.
*   Many modern studies involve R-CVP (rituximab + CVP) rather than CVP alone, as rituximab has become a standard component of initial treatment.

Given the nuances, it's difficult to provide a single ""best"" paper. However, to understand the role of observation vs. treatment strategies, I would recommend researching the PRIMA study and the JCOG2008 (MAIN) study further.
