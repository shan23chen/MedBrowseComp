This randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study enrolled 298 patients aged 70 to 85 years with histologically confirmed esophageal cancer. The trial demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy with S-1 significantly improved the 2-year overall survival rate (53.2%) compared to RT alone (35.8%).

Output it in the format NCT<Number>",NCT00143455,"The clinical trial that best describes the efficacy of Cisplatin and Irinotecan (IP) compared to Cisplatin and Etoposide (EP) in treating extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer is identified by the ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT0000349492. This randomized phase III study, conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), compared the two chemotherapy regimens in patients with previously untreated extensive-stage disease. The trial found no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups, with median survival times of 9.9 months for IP and 9.1 months for EP.
