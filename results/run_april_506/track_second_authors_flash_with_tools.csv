*   **CALGB 9781 (ResearchGate result):** This phase III trial compares trimodality therapy (Cisplatin, Fluorouracil, Radiotherapy, and Surgery) with surgery alone.

Some studies (like the Thomas et al. study mentioned in source [1]) show better response rates in previously untreated, early-stage patients, but this is for a specific subset of patients.
*   **Better Efficacy with Combinations:** The sources highlight that rituximab is most effective when combined with other chemotherapy drugs (like fludarabine and cyclophosphamide - FCR) or other targeted agents.

Given this context, finding a paper fitting your exact criteria proves difficult. If you are interested in second authors of papers studying Rituximab in CLL treatment, here are some options from the search results.

**Relevant Studies and Regimens:**

These articles suggest that CD-BEV can improve progression-free survival (PFS), especially in patients who have previously received antiangiogenic treatment.
*   **Atezolizumab in Combination with Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy:** The ATALANTE/ENGOT-ov29 trial ([4]) examined atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab and platinum-based therapy in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. AGO-OVAR 2.29 ([6, 9]) investigates atezolizumab with bevacizumab and non-platinum chemotherapy.
*   **Other Regimens:** Some studies compare paclitaxel-platinum doublets and gemcitabine-carboplatin doublets, with or without bevacizumab, versus single-agent carboplatin.

**Challenges in Identifying *The* Best Paper and Second Author:**

*   **Multiple Studies, Multiple Comparisons:** Several trials compare different combinations. Determining which one is ""best"" depends on the specific criteria (PFS, overall survival, side effects, patient population, etc.).
*   **Second Author Not Always Prominent:** The second author isn't always highlighted in summaries or abstracts.
*   **Focus on Regimen Efficacy:** The articles often emphasize the efficacy of the treatment regimens rather than specific authorship details.

Due to these limitations, I can't definitively provide a single ""SA"" output with the second author's name. To find the second author, you would need to access the full publication of each relevant study and examine the author list.

*   **Bevacizumab vs. Bevacizumab-aveg:** The search results do highlight studies comparing bevacizumab to a biosimilar (bevacizumab-aveg).
*   **CP+Bev vs. CP:** Many studies compare carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP) *with* bevacizumab to CP *alone* in treating non-squamous NSCLC. Some key findings from these studies:

    *   **Improved Outcomes:** Adding bevacizumab to CP often improves progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response rates (RR).
    *   **Toxicity:** Bevacizumab can increase the risk of certain side effects, such as bleeding, hypertension, and neutropenia.

Again, accessing the full paper on PubMed would be necessary to determine the second author.

3.  **Examine Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** RCTs are considered high-quality evidence. Search result [1] mentions the CROSS trial, which is a significant study in this area. Finding the original publication of the CROSS trial would be important, though this result does not name the second author of any paper.

**How to Determine the Second Author (Once You've Identified a Potential Paper):**

*   **PubMed/PMC:** If you find the paper on PubMed or PubMed Central, the author list is clearly displayed.
*   **Journal Website:** You can usually find the author list on the journal's website where the article was published.
*   **Google Scholar:** Searching for the paper on Google Scholar will also typically show the author list.

*   **Rituximab in Combination:** Several papers discuss Rituximab combined with other drugs like Venetoclax, Lenalidomide, or Chlorambucil. These combinations often show improved outcomes compared to the other drug alone.

To give you a useful answer, I need more specific criteria:

*   **Are you interested in specific outcomes?** (e.g., overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival)
*   **Are you interested in specific patient populations?** (e.g., treatment-naive, relapsed/refractory, elderly)
*   **Are you looking for a study that directly compares Rituximab monotherapy to observation (without any treatment)?** This is less common now as combination therapies are often preferred.

Once you provide more details, I can refine the search and provide a more accurate answer in the requested format (SA).

Output it in the format SA<Second Author>",Ute Berger,"Based on the information available, identifying a single paper that *perfectly* matches the request for Allo HSCT (no specific conditioning regimen) compared to Hydroxyurea and Interferon alfa-2a is difficult. However, I can provide some options based on related studies:

**Option 1 (Based on CML-Study III):**

*   The HemOnc.org wiki mentions ""Hehlmann et al. 2007 (CML-Study III), 1995-2001, Phase 3 (E-de-esc), Allo HSCT (no specific conditioning regimen), Seems to have longer OS (primary endpoint).""

    *   While it doesn't directly compare to Hydroxyurea AND Interferon alfa-2a, it uses Allo HSCT (no specific conditioning regimen).
    *   Unfortunately, I don't have the second author for this study.

**Option 2 (Related to Interferon Alfa-2a and Hydroxyurea):**

*   **Hehlmann R** et al. 2003 (CML-Study II) compared Interferon alpha and Hydroxyurea with Hydroxyurea monotherapy.
    *   The second author is **Berger U**

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** Finding a study that *directly* compares Allo HSCT to the *combination* of Hydroxyurea and Interferon alfa-2a may be challenging. Studies often compare Allo HSCT to other standard treatments at the time, which might have been either Interferon-based or Hydroxyurea-based.
*   **Study Design:** The ideal study would be a randomized controlled trial. Observational studies might also provide some insights, but the evidence is generally considered weaker.

Given the available information, I suggest using the study by Hehlmann R et al. with second author Berger U, since this compared Interferon alpha and Hydroxyurea with Hydroxyurea monotherapy

However, I can offer some relevant information and potential leads:

*   **Relevance of Rituximab Monotherapy:** Several sources ([2], [7], [8], [10]) discuss rituximab monotherapy in CLL. It appears to have a role, particularly in specific patient subsets (e.g., early-stage, asymptomatic CLL [7]), but is generally considered less effective than combination therapies or newer targeted agents ([2]).
*   **Comparison to Observation:** The PRIMA study ([1]) demonstrates that rituximab maintenance therapy (after induction) reduces disease progression risk compared to observation. However, the primary paper on this study would likely focus on maintenance *after* induction therapy, not rituximab monotherapy *versus* observation as a primary treatment strategy.
* **CLL11 trial**: Goede et al. presented findings from the CLL11 trial, which compared obinutuzumab (O) plus chlorambucil (Clb) and rituximab (R) plus Clb

*   **Combined Modality Therapy (CMT) vs. Observation/Chemotherapy Alone:** Several studies, including the RAPID trial, GHSG HD16 trial, and EORTC H10 trial, suggest that combined modality therapy (chemotherapy + radiation) often leads to better progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone or observation after chemotherapy in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma. The UK RAPID trial explored observation after chemotherapy for patients with negative interim PET scans.

*   **Radiation Dose and Field:** Studies have focused on reducing the radiation dose and field size (e.g., involved-field radiotherapy IFRT, involved nodal radiotherapy INRT) to minimize late complications like secondary malignancies, while maintaining efficacy.

*   **Individualized Approaches:** The trend is towards risk-adapted and response-based treatment, potentially using PET scans to guide decisions about radiation therapy.

*   **Cisplatin vs. Carboplatin Combinations:** Many articles compare Cisplatin and Gemcitabine to Carboplatin and Gemcitabine. The general trend is that Carboplatin/Gemcitabine is often considered a less toxic alternative with comparable efficacy to Cisplatin/Gemcitabine, *especially* in elderly or less fit patients.

**Option 1 (Focus on Gemcitabine and RT comparison to no neoadjuvant therapy):**

Several sources discuss trials comparing neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT) to upfront surgery or other chemotherapy regimens.

*   The PREOPANC-1 trial is mentioned, which compared neoadjuvant gemcitabine CRT to upfront surgery followed by adjuvant gemcitabine. While the initial publication didn't show a significant OS benefit, an updated abstract reportedly demonstrated an OS improvement in the neoadjuvant arm. Determining the second author would require finding the specific PREOPANC-1 publication or abstract.
*   A study by Golcher et al. (2015) compared upfront surgery with neoadjuvant gemcitabine + cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy. However, the results showed no significant difference in OS or R0 resection rates. Again, the second author would be Brunner TB if this study is what the user is looking for.

**Option 2 (Focus on Efficacy of Gemcitabine and RT):**

*   Evans et al. published a phase II study in 2006 using neoadjuvant therapy with CCRT (gemcitabine 400 mg/m2/RT 30Gy). If this study best describes the efficacy, then the second author is not listed in the snippet.

This is supported by studies like the EORTC trial mentioned in [6] where the combination improved survival.
*   **NOA-04 Trial:** Reference [8] discusses the NOA-04 trial, which compared radiotherapy to PCV or temozolomide chemotherapy in anaplastic gliomas. This study doesn't support a differential efficacy of temozolomide monotherapy compared to radiotherapy.
*   **RT+TMZ vs RT alone:** Reference [3] specifically reports outcomes for anaplastic glioma treated with RT with or without concurrent TMZ.

Here's a breakdown of relevant findings and how to interpret them:

*   **UFT vs. Observation is Not a Common Comparison:** The studies tend to focus on UFT in combination with other treatments (like radiotherapy) or compare it to other chemotherapy regimens (like 5-FU or capecitabine). Direct comparisons of UFT monotherapy *against* observation alone in rectal cancer are less frequent in the literature.

*   **UFT as Part of Multimodal Treatment:** Several sources highlight UFT's role when combined with radiotherapy, especially in the preoperative setting (before surgery) for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).

*   **UFT vs. Other Chemotherapy:** Some studies compare UFT to other chemotherapy drugs like 5-FU or capecitabine, often finding comparable efficacy and sometimes a more favorable side-effect profile.

*   **UFT for Unresectable Disease:** One study mentioned in the search results ([1]) involved UFT monotherapy (with leucovorin) in patients with progressive, unresectable disease. This is a different context than comparing UFT to observation in earlier-stage or resectable rectal cancer.

*   **Improved Outcomes:** Multiple studies suggest that adding cisplatin-based chemotherapy to radiation therapy improves outcomes (overall survival, progression-free survival) compared to radiation therapy alone, particularly in locally advanced NPC.
*   **Landmark Study:** The ""Intergroup-0099 study"" is highlighted as a pivotal trial that established concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy with radiotherapy as a standard of care for locally advanced NPC.
*   **Different Cisplatin Schedules:** Some studies compare different schedules of cisplatin administration (weekly vs. triweekly) during chemoradiation, with varying results regarding efficacy and toxicity.
*   **Toxicity:** Combined chemoradiotherapy is often associated with higher rates of toxicity.

**Potential Papers and Second Authors (based on the search results):**

"Find/search the second author of the paper that best describes the efficacy of No induction compared to MEPFL when used to treat Nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Output it in the format SA<Second Author>",C F Hsiao,"Based on the provided search results, identifying a single ""best"" paper definitively proving the efficacy of No induction compared to MEPFL for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is challenging. The efficacy of different induction chemotherapy regimens compared to each other and to no induction is complex and depends on various factors.

However, here's what can be gathered:

*   **MEPFL's Role:** Several studies mention MEPFL (mitomycin, epirubicin, cisplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) as an induction chemotherapy regimen. One study from Taiwan (likely referenced in several of the search snippets) showed that MEPFL *improved disease-free survival* in patients with stage IVA–IVB NPC compared to CRT alone, but *did not significantly increase overall survival*.
*   **Comparisons to Other Regimens:** Some studies compare MEPFL to other induction chemotherapy regimens like gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC). One study contrasts MEPFL's benefit of improved locoregional failure-free survival with GC's benefit of improved distant metastasis recurrence-free survival.
*   **Network Meta-Analyses:** Meta-analyses (like the one from HKU Scholars Hub) attempt to compare multiple induction chemotherapy regimens. These analyses often rank different regimens based on their impact on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). For example, one meta-analysis identified docetaxel + cisplatin (DC), gemcitabine + cisplatin (GP), and cisplatin + capecitabine (PX) as the top three IC regimens with the highest probability of benefit on overall survival.

**Difficulties in Direct Comparison:** The search results don't provide a single study that directly compares ""No induction"" to ""MEPFL"" and definitively proves the efficacy of one over the other across all situations. The best approach depends on the specific patient and the stage of the cancer.

"Find/search the second author of the paper that best describes the efficacy of ADT and Zoledronic acid compared to ADT when used to treat Prostate cancer.
Output it in the format SA<Second Author>",Toshiyuki Kamoto,"Based on the search results, I cannot pinpoint a single paper that definitively ""best"" describes the efficacy of ADT and zoledronic acid compared to ADT alone. However, I can provide some information regarding potential authors from the search results.

Several studies and analyses explore the use of zoledronic acid in conjunction with ADT for prostate cancer:

*   One study mentions Kamiya et al. who compared ADT + zoledronic acid to ADT alone and concluded that the combination had better PSA and bone turnover marker declines [1]. However, the second author is not mentioned.
*   The STAMPEDE trial investigated the addition of zoledronic acid (and other agents) to ADT. Several authors are associated with publications from the STAMPEDE trial, including James ND, Sydes MR, Clarke NW, and others [4, 7, 8]. However, determining the *second* author for the specific paper that ""best"" describes the efficacy is difficult to assess from the search results alone.
*   Craig Jones is mentioned as the lead study author for an analysis of the STAMPEDE trial data presented at the 2023 AUA Annual Meeting [3, 4].

To accurately identify the second author of a paper that best describes the efficacy of ADT and zoledronic acid compared to ADT, I would need to consult the full text of relevant publications.
