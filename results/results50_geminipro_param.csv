Note that we are only looking for overall FDA drug approval, not new indications or supplemental approvals.\nReturn only the company name in format of COMPANY: name.""",PF PRISM CV,"Okay, let's break this down:

1.  **Identify Trial and Regimens:**
    *   Trial: NCT02838420 (ENDURANCE-3)
    *   Regimen 1 (Experimental): Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (G/P)
    *   Regimen 2 (Comparator): Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir (SOF/DCV)

2.  **Determine ""Less Effective"" Regimen:**
    *   The primary endpoint was SVR12 (Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks post-treatment).
    *   Results: G/P SVR12 = 95% (222/233); SOF/DCV SVR12 = 97% (111/115).
    *   Numerically, in this specific trial, the G/P arm had slightly lower efficacy (95% vs 97%). Therefore, the ingredients Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir are from the ""less effective"" arm based *strictly* on the trial's numerical outcome.
    *   Alternatively, sometimes the comparator arm (SOF/DCV) is considered the point of comparison, representing an older or different standard, which might align with an interpretation of ""less effective"" in a broader development context, even if it performed well here. The ingredients are Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir.

3.  **Identify Ingredient Starting with 'C':**
    *   Ingredients from G/P arm: Glecaprevir, Pibrentasvir. Neither starts with 'C'.
    *   Ingredients from SOF/DCV arm: Sofosbuvir, Daclatasvir. Neither starts with 'C'.

    *   There seems to be an issue with the premise, as no *active* ingredient in either regimen starts with 'C'. However, if we consider *excipients* (inactive ingredients) sometimes listed, drugs like Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and Daclatasvir (Daklinza) contain **Croscarmellose sodium** or **Colloidal silicon dioxide**. Croscarmellose sodium starts with 'C'. This is a less common interpretation of ""regimen ingredient"" but fits the 'C' requirement.

4.  **Find Latest FDA Approval for Croscarmellose Sodium:**
    *   Croscarmellose sodium is an excipient, not an active drug with its own distinct initial FDA approval date in the same way an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) does. It is approved as part of numerous drug product applications (NDAs and ANDAs). There isn't a single ""overall FDA drug approval"" date tied to a specific company for an excipient like this.

5.  **Re-evaluation due to Contradiction:**
    *   Given the conflict (no active 'C' ingredient, and excipient doesn't fit the approval query well), let's revisit the ""less effective"" interpretation and ingredients. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the trial or a typo in the prompt. If we *must* select an active ingredient and assume a typo ('D' instead of 'C'), Daclatasvir from the SOF/DCV arm would be a candidate.

6.  **Proceeding with Assumption (Daclatasvir):**
    *   Ingredient (assumed): Daclatasvir (treating 'C' as a typo for 'D').
    *   Find the company with the latest overall FDA approval for Daclatasvir.
    *   Daclatasvir (Brand name: Daklinza) was first approved by the FDA on July 24, 2015.
    *   The applicant company was Bristol-Myers Squibb. There have not been later *initial* FDA approvals for Daclatasvir under other companies.

7.  **Final Answer Formulation (Based on Assumption):**
    *   The ingredient (assuming 'C' was a typo for 'D') is Daclatasvir.
    *   The company with the main/initial FDA approval is Bristol-Myers Squibb.

    *   Comparator Arm: Active Monitoring (Observation - no drug ingredient)
    The results indicated Daratumumab was more effective than Active Monitoring. Therefore, the ""less effective regimen"" (Active Monitoring) contains no drug ingredients. The only drug ingredient listed in the trial's interventions is Daratumumab, which starts with 'D' and was in the *more* effective arm. There is no ingredient listed in this trial protocol starting with 'C'.

2.  **Address the Contradiction:** The request cannot be fulfilled precisely as stated because no ingredient starting with 'C' is listed as part of either the more effective or less effective regimen *within this specific trial*.

3.  **Alternative Interpretation (Assumption Required):** If we assume the question intends to ask about *any* common Multiple Myeloma drug starting with 'C', one such drug is Carfilzomib.
    *   **Identified 'C' Ingredient (by assumption):** Carfilzomib (Kyprolis)

Doxil represents the last *major new formulation* NDA approval.
6.  **Find the exclusivity date associated with the relevant approval:** Exclusivity for the original 1974 approval has long expired. For Doxil (NDA 050718, approved 11-17-1995), several exclusivities were granted for new indications via supplements. Searching the FDA Orange Book for NDA 050718 shows multiple exclusivity codes (e.g., ODE, M) associated with supplemental approvals.

This study compared regimens like mFOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI, with or without Bevacizumab, for metastatic colorectal cancer. Both FOLFIRI and mFOLFOX6 are considered effective standard chemotherapy backbones.
2.  **Identify Ingredients:** The ingredients in the FOLFIRI regimen are Leucovorin Calcium, Fluorouracil, and Irinotecan Hydrochloride. The ingredients in mFOLFOX6 are Leucovorin Calcium, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin. Bevacizumab was also used.
3.  **Identify Ingredient Starting with 'I':** Among the ingredients in the effective regimens (FOLFIRI, mFOLFOX6, Bevacizumab), Irinotecan starts with 'I'.
4.  **Find Last Approval and Exclusivity for Irinotecan:**
    *   Search FDA's Orange Book for Irinotecan. There are different forms/products (Irinotecan Hydrochloride - Camptosar, generics; Irinotecan Liposome - Onivyde).
    *   The request asks for the exclusivity related to the ""last approved"" overall drug approval up to Dec 2024, excluding supplemental approvals.
    *   Irinotecan Hydrochloride (Camptosar) was first approved under NDA 020571 on 06-14-1996. Its original exclusivities have expired. A recent approval action for Camptosar under NDA 213729 occurred on 04-25-2024, but this does not appear to be a new ""overall approval"" granting significant market exclusivity and none is listed in the Orange Book for this NDA.
    *   Irinotecan Liposome (Onivyde) was first approved under NDA 207793 on 10-22-2015. This represents an overall approval of a distinct formulation. Its original NCE (New Chemical Entity/New Product) exclusivity expired 10-22-2020, and its ODE (Orphan Drug Exclusivity) expired 10-22-2022.
    *   However, Onivyde received a *supplemental* approval (S-007) for a new indication on 02-03-2024. While the prompt *excludes* supplemental approvals for identifying the *approval event*, it asks for the *exclusivity date* for the ingredient based on its *last approval*. The Feb 2024 supplemental approval is the most recent FDA action for an Irinotecan product *that granted new exclusivity*. This approval granted 3 years of exclusivity for a New Clinical Investigation (NCI).
    *   Given the conflicting constraints (exclude supplemental approvals vs. find exclusivity for last approval), the most relevant *active* exclusivity date stemming from a recent approval action before Dec 2024 is associated with the Feb 2024 supplemental approval for Onivyde.
    *   This NCI exclusivity expires 3 years after the approval date. Approval: 02-03-2024. Exclusivity Expiration: 02-03-2027.

1.  **Identify Regimens and Effectiveness:**
    *   The trial compared two regimens for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not eligible for stem cell transplant:
        *   Arm 1: Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone + **Elotuzumab** (LdE)
        *   Arm 2: Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (Ld)
    *   The trial aimed to determine if adding Elotuzumab (LdE) was *more effective* than Ld alone.
    *   However, the ELOQUENT-1 trial **did not meet its primary endpoint**. It failed to show a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival for the LdE arm compared to the Ld arm in this specific patient population (newly diagnosed).
    *   Despite the trial outcome, the regimen *intended* to be more effective (by adding a drug) was the one containing Elotuzumab. We will proceed by examining the ingredients of this regimen (LdE).

2.  **Identify Ingredient Starting with 'E':**
    *   The ingredients in the LdE regimen are: Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone, **Elotuzumab**.
    *   The ingredient starting with the letter 'E' is **Elotuzumab**.

3.  **Determine Most Recent FDA Approval for Elotuzumab and Company:**
    *   Elotuzumab (Brand Name: Empliciti) received its initial FDA approval on **November 30, 2015**.
    *   This approval was granted to **Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)**, in partnership with AbbVie. BMS is typically listed as the primary marketing authorization holder. As this is the only approval for Elotuzumab itself, it stands as the most recent overall approval up to December 2024.

1.  **Identify the Trial and Regimens:**
    *   The trial NCT01973387 (CLL11 study) compared three arms for previously untreated CLL:
        *   Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil (GClb)
        *   Rituximab + Chlorambucil (RClb)
        *   Chlorambucil alone (Clb)
    *   Results showed that Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil provided superior efficacy (progression-free survival) compared to Rituximab + Chlorambucil, and both combination arms were superior to Chlorambucil alone.
    *   Therefore, the ""more effective regimen"" ingredients are **Obinutuzumab** and **Chlorambucil**.

2.  **Identify Ingredient Starting with 'I':**
    *   Neither Obinutuzumab nor Chlorambucil starts with the letter 'I'.
    *   *Assumption:* It's possible the request is flawed or intends to refer to another highly effective drug used in CLL, even if not part of the *most effective regimen* in this specific trial. A prominent CLL drug starting with 'I' is **Ibrutinib**. We will proceed assuming Ibrutinib is the intended ingredient, noting it was *not* part of the GClb regimen in NCT01973387.

3.  **Most Recent FDA Approval for Ibrutinib & Company:**
    *   The *first* overall FDA approval for Ibrutinib (brand name Imbruvica) was granted on **November 13, 2013**.
    *   This initial approval was granted to **Pharmacyclics, Inc.** (later acquired by AbbVie, and co-marketed with Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company). While there have been many subsequent supplemental approvals for new indications, the November 13, 2013 approval represents the first overall FDA drug approval for the ingredient Ibrutinib.

4.  **Stock Market Listing and Details:**
    *   At the time of the approval (November 13, 2013), Pharmacyclics, Inc. *was* listed on a US stock market (NASDAQ).
    *   However, Pharmacyclics was acquired by AbbVie in May 2015 and is no longer an independently listed company.
    *   The question asks if ""*this company*"" (the one receiving approval) is listed. Since Pharmacyclics, Inc. as an entity is no longer listed, the most direct answer is that it is not currently listed under its original identity.

**Therefore:**

The ingredient identified (based on the assumption above) is **Ibrutinib**.
The company that received the initial FDA approval for Ibrutinib was **Pharmacyclics, Inc.**
Pharmacyclics, Inc. is no longer listed on any US stock market following its acquisition.

2.  **Determine the More Effective Regimen and Ingredients:**
    *   Results from this trial (published, e.g., Durie et al., Lancet 2017) showed that the three-drug combination of **Lenalidomide + Bortezomib + Dexamethasone (VRd)** was more effective (demonstrated superior progression-free survival and overall survival) than the two-drug combination.
    *   The ingredients in the more effective regimen are: Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone.

3.  **Identify the Ingredient Starting with 'L':**
    *   From the list (Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone), the ingredient starting with 'L' is **Lenalidomide**.

4.  **Determine the Company with the Most Recent FDA Approval for Lenalidomide (up to Dec 2024):**
    *   Lenalidomide (brand name Revlimid) was originally developed by Celgene, which received initial FDA approval on December 27, 2005.
    *   However, the request asks for the *most recent* FDA approval for the ingredient up until December 2024. This includes generic approvals (ANDAs).

    *Initial Conclusion:* Based *strictly* on the ingredients listed in the more effective regimen of NCT01231412, there is no ingredient starting with 'S'.

    *Alternative Interpretation:* It's possible the question intends to ask about a prominent drug used in this disease space (Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma) that starts with 'S', even if not part of this specific trial's winning arm. The most prominent MM drug starting with 'S' approved in recent years is **Selinexor**. Let's proceed *assuming* Selinexor is the intended ingredient, while noting the discrepancy.

4.  **Identify the 'S' Ingredient (Assuming Selinexor):**
    *   **Selinexor** (Brand name: Xpovio)

5.  **Determine Most Recent Overall FDA Approval for Selinexor (up to Dec 2024):**
    *   Searching FDA approvals, Selinexor received its first (overall) FDA approval on **July 3, 2019**. This approval was specifically for its use in combination with dexamethasone for adult patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Subsequent approvals were for different indications or combinations (e.g., diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, different MM combinations), which fall under supplemental/new indication approvals, not the initial *overall* drug approval specified in the request.
