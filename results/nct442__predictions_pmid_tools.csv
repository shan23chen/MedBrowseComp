Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",20206776,"Based on the search results, it's difficult to pinpoint one single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of enoxaparin monotherapy compared to apixaban monotherapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Here's why and what the research suggests:

*   **Direct Comparisons are Limited:** Some studies compare apixaban to enoxaparin, but often enoxaparin is used as a comparator in a broader treatment strategy (like enoxaparin/warfarin) rather than as a monotherapy. Also, studies often focus on specific scenarios like post-surgical prophylaxis.
*   **Apixaban as Monotherapy is Increasingly Common:** Apixaban is frequently used as a monotherapy for VTE, and studies often compare it to traditional therapies like LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin) and warfarin.
*   **Enoxaparin Monotherapy Data is Older:** Some studies explore enoxaparin monotherapy, but these may be older and compare it to treatments like acenocoumarol (a vitamin K antagonist).

**Relevant Studies & Considerations**

Here's a breakdown of relevant studies from the search results, keeping in mind the limitations:

*   **JAMA Network Open, 2020 (PMID not directly found, but DOI is 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.7410):** This study suggests that apixaban is a safe, less painful, and easier-to-take alternative to enoxaparin for *thromboprophylaxis* after surgery for gynecologic cancer. It hypothesizes equivalent efficacy in preventing VTE.
*   **A study in ""Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes"" (2021) investigates monotherapy anticoagulation with apixaban or rivaroxaban for low-risk VTE patients in the emergency department setting.** It shows low rates of bleeding and VTE recurrence.
*   **A study comparing Apixaban versus enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism following total knee arthroplasty found that apixaban resulted in a lower VTE incidence and fewer hemorrhagic complications.**

**In Conclusion**

While a definitive ""best"" paper is hard to declare, the search results suggest that apixaban monotherapy is a more studied and increasingly utilized approach in VTE treatment, often demonstrating non-inferiority (or even superiority in some aspects like bleeding risk) compared to enoxaparin or traditional LMWH/warfarin combinations.

*   **Apixaban Reduces Hospitalizations in Patients With Venous Thromboembolism: An Analysis of the Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep‐Vein Thrombosis as First‐Line Therapy (AMPLIFY) Trial** Apixaban significantly reduced all-cause hospitalizations versus enoxaparin/warfarin, and shortened the length of hospital stay in patients with acute venous thromboembolism.

*   **POSEIDON Trial:** This phase III study (PMID not explicitly provided in search results, but information is from a Journal of Clinical Oncology publication) investigated durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in combination with chemotherapy (CT) for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    *   Chemotherapy options included cisplatin or carboplatin plus pemetrexed for nonsquamous histology.
    *   Results:
        *   Durvalumab + CT (D + CT) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to CT alone. Overall survival (OS) showed a trend toward improvement but didn't reach statistical significance.
        *   Tremelimumab + Durvalumab + CT (T + D + CT) significantly improved both PFS and OS compared to CT alone.
*   **Keynote-189:** Compared platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) plus pemetrexed +/- pembrolizumab in patients with untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements.
*   **Bagley et al. (2019)** Comparative Effectiveness of Carboplatin/Pemetrexed With Versus Without Bevacizumab for Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

This study found that adding bevacizumab to carboplatin/pemetrexed was associated with improved overall survival in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.

**Summary of Efficacy:**

*   **Carboplatin/Cisplatin + Pemetrexed:** This is a standard chemotherapy backbone for nonsquamous NSCLC.
*   **Carboplatin/Cisplatin + Pemetrexed + Durvalumab:** The POSEIDON trial suggests that adding durvalumab to this regimen improves PFS, and adding tremelimumab and durvalumab improves both PFS and OS compared to chemotherapy alone.
*   **Carboplatin/Cisplatin + Pemetrexed + Pembrolizumab:** KEYNOTE-189 showed the benefit of adding pembrolizumab to platinum plus pemetrexed.
*   **Carboplatin/Pemetrexed + Bevacizumab:** Bagley et al (2019) suggests an improved overall survival compared to carboplatin/pemetrexed.

Based on the search results, the study that directly compares carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed to carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed + durvalumab (with or without tremelimumab) in a phase III trial is the **POSEIDON trial.**

**Alectinib vs. Chemotherapy (General)**

*   Alectinib is generally more effective than standard chemotherapy in ALK-positive NSCLC (PMID not found).
*   Alectinib showed a significantly longer Progression-Free Survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy.
*   Alectinib showed better Central Nervous System (CNS) control compared to chemotherapy.
*   Alectinib is a standard of care for ALK-positive NSCLC. (PMID not found).

**Alectinib vs. Crizotinib (Chemotherapy comparison)**

*   One study (PROFILE 1014) compared Crizotinib with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (Cisplatin/Carboplatin + Pemetrexed) as first-line treatment. PFS was longer with Crizotinib (10.9 months vs 7 months with chemo).

**Alectinib vs. Chemotherapy regimens**

*   ALINA trial: Alectinib improved disease-free survival compared to chemotherapy (including Cisplatin/Vinorelbine, Gemcitabine, or Pemetrexed) in early-stage, resected ALK+ NSCLC. Alectinib reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 76%.
*   ALUR study: Alectinib was compared to chemotherapy (Pemetrexed or Docetaxel) in patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and Crizotinib. Alectinib showed significantly improved PFS (9.6 months vs 1.4 months with chemotherapy).

It's difficult to pinpoint one single ""best"" paper directly comparing all the listed chemotherapy regimens (CVb, Cisplatin/Pemetrexed, GC, GCb, Carboplatin/Pemetrexed, Carboplatin/Vinorelbine) against Alectinib. However, based on the collective information:

*   The ALINA trial ([7]) likely provides the most relevant comparison, as it directly compares adjuvant Alectinib to several common platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (including Cisplatin/Vinorelbine, Gemcitabine, or Pemetrexed) in resected NSCLC.

*   **BELLE-3 Trial (PMID: 29223745):** This is a phase 3 trial evaluating buparlisib plus fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer progressing on or after mTOR inhibition. While it doesn't directly compare to fulvestrant *monotherapy* in the same trial, it provides data on the efficacy and safety of the combination. The conclusion was that the safety profile didn't support further development in this setting, but the efficacy supported the rationale for PI3K inhibitors plus endocrine therapy in patients with PIK3CA mutations.

*   **Meta-analysis comparing targeted therapy plus fulvestrant vs. fulvestrant monotherapy:** One meta-analysis (likely the one referenced as PLOS One) indicates that the combination of targeted therapy plus fulvestrant showed significantly higher PFS (progression-free survival) and ORR (objective response rate) compared to fulvestrant monotherapy in previously endocrine therapy-treated patients. However, it also notes higher toxicities with the combination.

*   **Review of Fulvestrant in Breast Cancer (PMID: 33198445):** This review mentions trials (BELLE-2 and BELLE-3) where fulvestrant was used in combination with buparlisib and other drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. It suggests that while fulvestrant is effective as monotherapy, its role might be best reserved for combination therapy.

*   **""Efficiency of Fulvestrant Monotherapy After CDK4/6 Inhibitor Exposure: Is This a Viable Choice?""**: This review focuses on the efficacy of fulvestrant *monotherapy* specifically after CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, providing context for when fulvestrant alone might be considered.

**In Summary:**

*   For direct comparison, look for meta-analyses or systematic reviews that pool data from multiple trials comparing the two treatment approaches.

*   The BELLE-3 trial (PMID: 29223745) is a key study for the Buparlisib + Fulvestrant arm.

*   **Pomalidomide is Often Used with Dexamethasone:** Many studies evaluate pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, as this is a common and effective treatment strategy. Finding studies *directly* comparing pomalidomide alone to the combination can be difficult.

*   **MM-002 Study:** One key study that led to the initial approval of pomalidomide showed a higher overall response rate with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone compared to pomalidomide alone. However, I don't have the specific PubMed ID for this trial.

*   **MM-003 Trial:** This trial compared pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone to high-dose dexamethasone.

**Therefore, I can't give you a single ""best"" PubMed ID.** However, I can suggest searching PubMed for these studies and related articles to find the information you need:

1.  **Search PubMed:** Use search terms like ""pomalidomide monotherapy multiple myeloma,"" ""pomalidomide dexamethasone multiple myeloma,"" and ""MM-002 trial.""

However, here's a breakdown of relevant findings and potential papers, along with reasons why one might be more suitable:

**Key Considerations from the Search Results:**

*   **CheckMate 9LA Study:** This study (mentioned in result \[1]) compared carboplatin/paclitaxel to cisplatin/pemetrexed in squamous cell carcinoma. While not directly addressing nivolumab, it highlights differences in outcomes based on chemotherapy regimen and histology, which is relevant to your question.
*   **Nivolumab combinations:** Result \[1] mentions a phase IB study by Kanda et al., suggesting nivolumab with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab had a better effect than nivolumab with cisplatin and pemetrexed. It also references Rizvi et al., who demonstrated better efficacy for nivolumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel compared to cisplatin with pemetrexed. However, these don't isolate the exact comparisons you're asking about.
*   **WJOG8515L study:** Result \[3] describes a study comparing nivolumab to carboplatin-pemetrexed in EGFR-mutated NSCLC that is resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This study found that nivolumab did *not* confer a longer PFS than carboplatin-pemetrexed in the study patients.
*   **Safety and efficacy of nivolumab with chemotherapy**: Result \[2] describes a phase Ib study that investigated the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of nivolumab combined with standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The regimens included nivolumab 10 mg/kg + gemcitabine/cisplatin, pemetrexed/cisplatin, paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab, or docetaxel.

**Potential Relevant Papers:**

1.  **The Kanda et al. and Rizvi et al. studies** mentioned in \[1]: While not providing a direct comparison of all the regimens you specified, they suggest trends in efficacy based on the chemotherapy backbone used with nivolumab. You'd need to find the original publications to evaluate their relevance fully.

2. **""Safety and efficacy of nivolumab and standard chemotherapy drug combination in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a four arms phase Ib study""**: This paper studies the efficacy of nivolumab in combination with either gemcitabine/cisplatin, pemetrexed/cisplatin, paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab or docetaxel.

**In Conclusion:**

Due to the limitations of the search results, providing a single ""best"" PubMed ID is difficult. The most informative approach would be to:

1.  Track down the original publications by Kanda et al. and Rizvi et al. to see if they provide the specific comparisons you need.
2.  Look into the ""Safety and efficacy of nivolumab and standard chemotherapy drug combination in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a four arms phase Ib study"" paper.
3.  Be aware that the CheckMate 9LA study, while not directly answering your question, highlights the importance of considering histology and chemotherapy backbone when evaluating treatment efficacy in NSCLC.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",35665782,"Based on the search results, it's challenging to pinpoint one single paper that *perfectly* compares Paclitaxel monotherapy directly to Trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy in unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. Here's why, and what the closest options are:

*   **Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Focus:** Many studies focus on Trastuzumab deruxtecan's efficacy, often compared to other HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) or in combination regimens.
*   **Paclitaxel as a Comparator:** Paclitaxel often serves as a component in combination chemotherapy regimens or as ""investigator's choice chemotherapy"" in trials evaluating newer drugs like Trastuzumab deruxtecan.
*   **HER2 Status Matters:** The HER2 status of the breast cancer significantly influences treatment options and the relevance of these drugs.

**Closest Relevant Information & Potential PMIDs (or related info):**

1.  **DESTINY-Breast06 Trial (information found in multiple snippets):** This trial (mentioned in snippet \[6]) compares Trastuzumab deruxtecan to investigator's choice chemotherapy (which *could* include paclitaxel monotherapy) in HER2-low, hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.
    *   This trial is relevant because it directly compares trastuzumab deruxtecan to a chemotherapy option that could be paclitaxel in a metastatic setting.
    *   **PMID:** It's difficult to provide a direct PMID for this ongoing trial. Search PubMed or clinicaltrials.gov using ""DESTINY-Breast06"" or ""NCT0474015"" to find updates and publications as they become available.

2.  **DESTINY-Breast04 Trial (snippets \[14]):** This trial compared trastuzumab deruxtecan with physician's choice chemotherapy in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. While it doesn't isolate paclitaxel monotherapy, it does provide a comparison against a chemotherapy regimen that a physician might choose.
    *   **PMID:** While the snippets don't provide the PMID, searching PubMed for ""Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Previously Treated HER2-Low Advanced Breast Cancer"" should lead you to the relevant publication.

3.  **Real-world Nab-Paclitaxel Monotherapy Study (snippets \[8], \[10]):** These snippets refer to a study assessing the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel (a modified form of paclitaxel) monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.
    * **PMID:** The PMID is not explicitly stated in the snippet, but the snippet mentions the following article: Cancer Res Treat. 2022 Apr;54(2):488-496. doi: 10.4143/crt. 2021.394. You can use this information to find the paper on PubMed.

**In summary:** While a direct head-to-head comparison is elusive in the provided search results, the DESTINY-Breast06 and DESTINY-Breast04 trials offer the most relevant comparisons, as they pit trastuzumab deruxtecan against standard chemotherapy options (which could include paclitaxel) in metastatic breast cancer. Also, the real-world Nab-Paclitaxel monotherapy study offers a look into Paclitaxel's efficacy.

Once you locate the full publications for these trials, you'll be able to assess the efficacy data more comprehensively.

However, overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between the two treatment arms.
*   **Melphalan and ASCT vs. MPR:** A phase III randomized trial by Palumbo et al. compared melphalan 200 mg and ASCT with melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide (MPR). The results favored melphalan and ASCT, with both PFS and OS significantly longer with HDM-ASCT than with MPR.
*   **ASCT vs. VMP:** PFS, but not OS, was significantly improved with ASCT compared with VMP (bortezomib–melphalan–prednisone)
*   **DETERMINATION trial:** The DETERMINATION phase 3 trial of lenalidomide–bortezomib–dexamethasone (RVd) ± HDM-ASCT, followed by lenalidomide maintenance to progression, showed that median PFS with RVd + ASCT versus RVd-alone was 67.5 versus 46.2 months.

*   **EMERGING-CTONG 1103 Trial (Phase II)**
    *   **PMID:**  Not explicitly provided in the search results, but the study is identified by its ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01407822 (you can use this to find the corresponding PubMed ID).
    *   This study compared erlotinib to gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) as *perioperative* therapy in stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations.
    *   While the primary endpoint (objective response rate) wasn't met, erlotinib showed a milder toxicity profile compared to GC.
    *   Median overall survival (OS) was 42.2 months with erlotinib and 36.9 months with GC (HR 0.83, p=0.513) - not statistically significant. Progression-free survival (PFS) was superior with erlotinib.
    *   The study suggests perioperative erlotinib is feasible and well-tolerated, but doesn't show an OS benefit over GC.

*   **TALENT (Tarceva Lung Cancer Investigation Trial) (Phase III)**
    *   **Key Finding:** Erlotinib *in combination* with cisplatin and gemcitabine did *not* show a survival benefit compared to cisplatin and gemcitabine alone in chemotherapy-naive advanced NSCLC patients.
    *   **Details:** A large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
    *   No significant differences in overall survival, time to progression, or response rate were observed between the erlotinib + chemo and chemo alone groups.
    *   **PMID:**  While not directly stated in one snippet, searching for ""Tarceva Lung Cancer Investigation Trial pubmed"" should reveal the PubMed ID. One of the search results refers to a PDF associated with the study and mentions, ""Downloaded from jco.ascopubs.org on September 13, 2015,"" suggesting the study was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO).

*   **ENSURE (Phase III, EGFR Mutation-Positive Asian Patients)**
    *   This trial compared erlotinib to gemcitabine/cisplatin specifically in Asian patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
    *   Erlotinib showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin.
    *   Quality of life (QoL) assessments favored erlotinib over gemcitabine/cisplatin.
    *   **PMID:** Not directly available in the snippets, but searching for ""ENSURE erlotinib gemcitabine cisplatin NSCLC pubmed"" should lead you to it.

To provide the *best* single paper that *directly* compares GC to Erlotinib *monotherapy* in *unselected* NSCLC, further searching focusing on meta-analyses or systematic reviews might be helpful. The TALENT trial shows erlotinib *added* to GC doesn't improve outcomes. The EMERGING trial suggests a potential benefit for erlotinib in the perioperative setting for *EGFR-mutated* tumors. The ENSURE trial directly compares Erlotinib to GC, but it also focuses on the EGFR-mutated population. The meta-analysis results suggest that adding anti-angiogenic drugs to erlotinib may improve PFS in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations.

"Find the pubmed id of the paper  that best describes the efficacy of Radiation therapy compared to MOPP-ABV, then Radiation therapy when used to treat Classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",17989384,"Based on the information from the search results, here's an analysis of the efficacy of radiation therapy compared to MOPP-ABV and when radiation therapy is used in treating Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma:

**Efficacy of Radiation Therapy Compared to MOPP-ABV:**

*   **Historical Context:** Initially, radiation therapy (RT) was a primary treatment for Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). However, the advent of effective chemotherapy regimens like ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) led to chemotherapy becoming the preferred treatment, especially for advanced stages.
*   **EORTC Study:** A notable study by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) randomized patients with advanced-stage HL in complete remission after 6-8 cycles of MOPP-ABV to either no further treatment or involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT). The results indicated no significant difference in event-free survival or overall survival between the two groups, suggesting that in some cases, RT might not provide additional benefit after a complete response to chemotherapy.
*   **H8-F Study:** The H8-F study compared MOPP-ABV ×3 plus IFRT with subtotal nodal irradiation alone (STNI, reference group). The estimated 5-year EFS was significantly higher after MOPP-ABV ×3 plus IFRT than after STNI alone (98% vs. 74%, P<0.001). The 10-year OS estimates were 97% and 92%, respectively (P=0.001)

**When Radiation Therapy Is Used in Treating Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma:**

*   **Combined Modality Therapy:** Radiation therapy is often used in combination with chemotherapy (combined modality therapy or CMT). This approach aims to maximize survival rates while minimizing long-term side effects.
*   **Early Stage Favorable Disease:** For early-stage favorable Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL), treatment often involves a few cycles of ABVD chemotherapy followed by involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT).
*   **Advanced Stages:** The role of radiation therapy in advanced stages is more nuanced. Consolidation RT after chemotherapy remains controversial. Some studies suggest it can be omitted in patients who achieve a negative interim PET scan and a durable response to chemotherapy.
*   **Bulky Disease:** Radiation therapy may be considered for patients with initial bulky disease (tumors greater than 10 cm) or residual disease after chemotherapy.
*   **Relapsed/Refractory Disease:** Radiation therapy can be used as salvage therapy for localized relapses after initial treatment.
*   **Specific Regimens:** Some specific treatment regimens, like Stanford V, incorporate radiation therapy for all patients with bulky disease.

**PubMed ID:**

Based on the search results, it is difficult to identify a single paper that *best* describes the efficacy of radiation therapy compared to MOPP-ABV and its use in treating Classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Here's why and what I can offer:

*   **Limited Head-to-Head Data:** The searches didn't reveal a direct, comparative study of just docetaxel monotherapy against camrelizumab monotherapy. Many studies involve combinations.
*   **Camrelizumab Focus:** Several papers focus on camrelizumab, often in combination with chemotherapy, and its efficacy in ESCC. Docetaxel is frequently mentioned as a chemotherapy comparator or as part of a combination regimen.

Given the constraints, here's what I can provide:

1.  **Efficacy of Camrelizumab Monotherapy:**

    *   **Paper [2]** suggests camrelizumab monotherapy has a good therapeutic effect in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
    *   **Paper [11]** mentions camrelizumab monotherapy has an ORR (objective response rate) of approximately 20% in ESCC.
2.  **Docetaxel Monotherapy:**

    *   **Paper [1]** mentions a phase II trial of docetaxel monotherapy with an ORR of 20%, a median OS of 8.1 months, and a 1-year survival rate of 35%.
    *   **Paper [6]** indicates docetaxel monotherapy, among other chemotherapies, has limited survival benefits, with a median overall survival of 5.3-6.1 months.
3.  **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis:**

    *   **Paper [8]** is a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing camrelizumab to docetaxel or irinotecan (chemotherapy) as a second-line treatment. In this model, the median OS was 8 months for camrelizumab and 6 months in the chemotherapy group.

**In summary:** While a direct head-to-head comparison is elusive, these papers provide some insight.  Paper [8], a cost-effectiveness analysis, directly compares camrelizumab to docetaxel (or irinotecan) and provides overall survival data. So, based on the available information, I'd suggest looking at paper [8].  However, please note that the ""chemotherapy"" arm includes docetaxel *or* irinotecan, not docetaxel alone.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",34469646,"Based on the information gathered, it's challenging to pinpoint a single paper with a PubMed ID that perfectly encapsulates the efficacy comparison you're seeking. However, here's a breakdown of findings and potentially relevant papers:

**Key Findings & Comparisons:**

*   **Dexamethasone vs. Prednisolone:** Dexamethasone often demonstrates a faster initial response (platelet count increase) compared to prednisolone. However, long-term response rates are often similar. Some studies suggest dexamethasone *with post-therapy* (additional courses or tapering) may reduce long-term relapse compared to prednisolone alone. Dexamethasone may also have fewer adverse events.

*   **Dexamethasone/Prednisolone + Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) vs. Steroids Alone:** The addition of MMF to corticosteroid treatment (either dexamethasone or prednisolone) may reduce treatment failure rates and increase complete response rates.

*   **Dexamethasone + Rituximab:** Some studies suggest that combining rituximab with dexamethasone yields higher *sustained* response rates compared to dexamethasone monotherapy.

**Potentially Relevant Papers & PubMed IDs (where available):**

1.  **Pell J, Greenwood R, Ingram J, Wale K, Thomas I, Kandiyali R, Mumford A, Dick A, Bagot C ... Mycophenolate Mofetil for First-Line Treatment of Immune Thrombocytopenia. N. Engl. J. Med. 2021;385:885–895. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2100596.** This study investigates Mycophenolate Mofetil for First-Line Treatment of Immune Thrombocytopenia.

2.  **Blood. 2010 Apr 8;115(14):2755-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-229815. Epub 2010 Feb 3.** - Dexamethasone plus rituximab yields higher sustained response rates than dexamethasone monotherapy in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia.

3.  **Blood 2013;121:1976-81.** Rituximab and dexamethasone vs dexamethasone monotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia.

4.  **J Thromb Haemost. 2009;7(6):1036–1038.**  Faster platelet recovery by high-dose dexamethasone compared with standard-dose prednisolone in adult immune thrombocytopenia: a prospective randomized trial.

5.  **N Engl J Med. (2021) 385:885–95. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2100596.** Mycophenolate mofetil for first-line treatment of immune thrombocytopenia.

**In summary:**

While a single, perfect paper is elusive, the most relevant research appears to be focusing on:

*   Comparing dexamethasone to prednisolone (with emphasis on initial vs. sustained responses).
*   Evaluating the *addition* of mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab to dexamethasone or prednisolone regimens.

To get the *most* complete picture, it would be best to review several of the papers mentioned above.

The standard R-CHOP regimen already includes prednisone. Therefore, the query is about comparing R-CHOP to R-CHOP. However, I can offer some relevant information:

*   **R-CHOP vs. CHOP:** Several studies compare R-CHOP (rituximab plus CHOP) to CHOP alone (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). These studies demonstrate the superiority of R-CHOP in improving overall survival and progression-free survival.

*   **R-CHOP vs. R-CHOEP:** One study (PMID: 39037054) compares R-CHOP to R-CHOEP (R-CHOP plus etoposide) in young patients with high-risk DLBCL. The study did not find a significant difference between the two regimens.

Many studies evaluate KRd (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) versus Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone).

However, I can offer some relevant information and potentially helpful PubMed IDs:

*   **Studies Comparing KRd to Rd:** The ASPIRE study is a key trial that compared carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). While it doesn't isolate lenalidomide monotherapy, it provides a benchmark for the KRd combination against a lenalidomide-containing regimen.
    *   PubMed search using ""ASPIRE study multiple myeloma carfilzomib lenalidomide"" should locate relevant publications.
*   **Lenalidomide Monotherapy Information:** Some search results mention lenalidomide monotherapy as a maintenance therapy post-transplant or in patients who are transplant-ineligible.
    *   PubMed search for ""lenalidomide monotherapy multiple myeloma maintenance"" could be useful.
*   **KRd Efficacy:** Several studies demonstrate the efficacy of the KRd combination in various settings (relapsed/refractory MM, newly diagnosed MM). These provide context for how the KRd regimen performs.

To find a paper *directly* comparing lenalidomide monotherapy to KR, you might need to broaden your search terms or look for review articles that synthesize data from multiple studies.

While I cannot provide the *exact* PubMed ID you're looking for, I hope this breakdown of the available information and search strategies helps you find the most relevant paper for your needs.

1.  **Meta-analysis comparing ABVD and BEACOPP (PMID: 27531149):**

    *   This meta-analysis suggests that BEACOPP has a better complete remission rate, greater than 5-year overall survival, and progression-free survival than ABVD therapy.

*   **Studies Comparing Biosimilars to Original Rituximab:** Studies like the one mentioned in \[2] specifically analyze the efficacy and safety of rituximab biosimilars compared to the reference drug (MabThera) in low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma. The conclusion is that efficacy and safety are highly similar.

Given this, instead of looking for a study that *differentiates* their efficacy, the focus is on studies that *demonstrate* their *comparable* efficacy (establishing biosimilarity).

**Recommendation:**

Consider this publication which indicates similar outcomes between Rituximab and biosimilars:

However, I can provide you with relevant papers that address some of these comparisons:

1.  **Comparative Effectiveness of Atezolizumab, Nivolumab, and Docetaxel**: This study (PMID not explicitly provided in the snippet, you'll need to use the title to find it on PubMed) compares Atezolizumab vs. Nivolumab vs. Docetaxel monotherapy in previously treated NSCLC. It concludes that Atezolizumab was superior to Docetaxel and similar to Nivolumab regarding overall survival.
2.  **LUNAR Trial (TTFields + Systemic Therapy)**: Several snippets refer to the LUNAR trial. This trial investigated TTFields in combination with either ICIs (including Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Atezolizumab) or Docetaxel. It found that adding TTFields to standard systemic therapy (ICI or Docetaxel) improved overall survival compared to standard therapy alone.
    *   A key publication of this trial is in *The Lancet Oncology*. You'd need to search PubMed for ""LUNAR trial Lancet Oncology"" to get the specific PMID.

Therefore, to fully address your question, you would likely need to consider *both* of these papers (or the LUNAR trial publication). One compares the monotherapies, and the other evaluates the addition of TTFields to various standard therapies.

It's important to note that there doesn't appear to be a direct head-to-head trial of Nivolumab monotherapy versus all the combinations you listed within these results.

This study found similar efficacy in preventing VTE recurrence with rivaroxaban compared to enoxaparin/VKA, and rivaroxaban was associated with fewer major bleeding events.

*   **Rivaroxaban as a Viable Alternative:** A meta-analysis examining rivaroxaban compared to enoxaparin in cancer patients with VTE suggests rivaroxaban can be a viable alternative to enoxaparin without significant drawbacks for preventing and managing VTE in this population.

*   **Rivaroxaban Monotherapy vs. Enoxaparin/VKA:** A study in *Circulation* (2007) explored rivaroxaban monotherapy versus enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist for proximal deep vein thrombosis. While a phase II trial, it provides a direct comparison of the monotherapies.

*   **Bortezomib vs. Dexamethasone Monotherapy:** Several sources mention the APEX trial, which compared bortezomib monotherapy to high-dose dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",26932802,"Based on the information I found, it appears that there isn't one single paper that definitively ""best"" describes the efficacy of PCD compared to Pd in multiple myeloma. However, here's a summary of findings and potentially relevant papers:

*   **PCD Generally Shows Improved Outcomes:** Several studies suggest that adding cyclophosphamide to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (PCD) improves outcomes compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) alone, particularly in certain patient populations.

*   **Key Findings on Efficacy:**

    *   **Overall Response Rate (ORR):** Studies often report a higher ORR with PCD compared to Pd.
    *   **Progression-Free Survival (PFS):** Some studies, including a phase III trial by the Asian Myeloma Network, indicate that PCD significantly prolongs PFS compared to Pd.
    *   **Overall Survival (OS):** While some studies show improved ORR and PFS with PCD, the overall survival benefit may not always be significantly different.

*   **Relevant Studies to Consider:**

    *   **Asian Myeloma Network (AMN) Study:** A randomized phase III trial comparing PCd vs. Pd in Asian patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. This study demonstrated that PCd significantly prolonged progression-free survival and improved overall response rate compared to Pd in patients with prior exposure to a proteasome inhibitor and lenalidomide.
    *   **A phase II study of pomalidomide, daily oral cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma:** This study reports on an open-label, single-center phase II study of PCD. The overall response rate was 73%, and the median progression-free survival was 13.3 months.
    *   **Cyclophosphamide addition to pomalidomide/dexamethasone is not necessarily associated with universal benefits in RRMM:** This real-world study showed that while PCD had a better ORR than Pd, there were no significant differences in survival outcomes. The study suggests that the addition of cyclophosphamide may be beneficial in fit patients with high-risk MM, extramedullary disease, and less-than-satisfactory response to previous lenalidomide treatment.

Here's a summary of findings from different studies, which may help you decide which is most relevant to your specific interest:

*   **Rivaroxaban often shows better efficacy:** Several meta-analyses and studies suggest rivaroxaban may have better efficacy in reducing VTE risk compared to enoxaparin, particularly in the context of thromboprophylaxis after orthopedic surgery.
*   **Similar safety profiles:** Some studies indicate similar safety profiles regarding major bleeding risk between rivaroxaban and enoxaparin.
*   **Context matters:** The specific context, such as whether the patient has cancer or is undergoing orthopedic surgery, can influence the choice between these anticoagulants. Some guidelines recommend DOACs like rivaroxaban over LMWH (like enoxaparin) in specific situations (e.g., VTE in cancer patients).
*   **EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE trials:** These trials compared rivaroxaban to enoxaparin/warfarin for acute VTE treatment and found rivaroxaban non-inferior for preventing recurrent VTE, with a lower frequency of major bleeding.

Given the above, here are a few potentially relevant papers, and you can assess which ""best"" fits your needs based on the abstract and full text:

*   **Monotherapy Focus:** It's more difficult to find studies that *specifically* isolate the efficacy of rituximab and hyaluronidase *monotherapy* versus rituximab *monotherapy* in follicular lymphoma.
*   **Meta-analysis:** One meta-analysis assesses subcutaneous rituximab in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma, but doesn't directly compare it to rituximab monotherapy.

Given the available information, providing a single ""best"" PubMed ID is difficult. However, if you are interested in efficacy and safety of subcutaneous rituximab, consider researching ""Clinical efficacy and safety of subcutaneous rituximab in non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis"".

It's important to note:

*   The subcutaneous formulation is often used to improve convenience.
*   The subcutaneous formulation is usually rituximab *plus* hyaluronidase, not hyaluronidase monotherapy.

"Find the pubmed id of the paper  that best describes the efficacy of CMF and RT|E-CMF and RT|A-CMF and RT|MMM and RT compared to A-CMF when used to treat Breast cancer.
Output it in the format pmid<pubmed id>",31785830,"Based on the search results, it's difficult to pinpoint one single paper that perfectly encapsulates the efficacy of all the mentioned regimens (CMF and RT|E-CMF and RT|A-CMF and RT|MMM and RT) compared to A-CMF in treating breast cancer. However, here's a breakdown of what the search suggests and how to potentially find the best paper:

**1. Key Considerations**

*   **Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses:** Look for these types of studies, as they combine data from multiple trials, providing a broader and more reliable picture.
*   **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** These are the gold standard for comparing treatments.
*   **Publication Date:** Be mindful of the publication date, as treatment approaches evolve. More recent publications will reflect current standards of care.
*   **Specific Comparisons:** Focus on studies that *directly* compare the regimens you're interested in.

**2. Relevant Information from the Search Results**

*   **Fernando et al. 2019 (SECRAB)** (mentioned in HemOnc.org [1]): This Phase 3 study compared CMF & RT, E-CMF & RT, A-CMF & RT, and MMM & RT.  This study seems highly relevant, though a direct comparison to A-CMF alone might not be the primary focus. You would need to find the paper itself to evaluate.
*   **Gianni et al. 2009 (ECTO)** (mentioned in HemOnc.org [1] and Role of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis [15]): This trial compared AT-CMF to other regimens. It might offer insights into the role of adding anthracyclines (like in A-CMF) to CMF.
*   **Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis (2005)** (Postmastectomy radiation: an evolution [14]): This meta-analysis included a large number of women and examined the impact of radiotherapy. While it may not focus specifically on the chemotherapy regimens you listed, it provides context on the role of RT in conjunction with other treatments.
*   **Meta-analyses comparing Anthracycline-based vs. CMF:** Several search results ([4], [6], [17]) refer to meta-analyses that compare anthracycline-based regimens to CMF. These could be helpful in understanding the relative efficacy of A-CMF (which includes an anthracycline) versus CMF.  Note that these may not include the radiation component you're interested in.
*   **NHS England Guidelines [10] & NCCN Guidelines [16]:** These guidelines provide treatment recommendations, which are informed by the available evidence. They might not contain a single study that answers your question, but they can point you towards the regimens that are considered most effective.

**3. How to Find the ""Best"" Paper**

1.  **PubMed Search:** Based on the information above, conduct a targeted PubMed search.  Try these search strings:

    *   `(Breast cancer) AND (CMF OR E-CMF OR A-CMF OR MMM) AND (radiotherapy OR radiation) AND (comparison OR efficacy OR outcome)`
    *   `(Breast cancer) AND (CMF OR E-CMF OR A-CMF OR MMM) AND (radiotherapy OR radiation) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review)`
    *   Specifically search for the Fernando et al. 2019 (SECRAB) paper.

2.  **Filter and Review:**
    *   Filter your PubMed results to show the most recent articles first.
    *   Carefully read the abstracts of the papers that appear to be relevant.
    *   If an abstract looks promising, obtain the full text of the article and scrutinize its methodology, results, and conclusions.

**In summary, while I cannot provide a single PubMed ID right now, the Fernando et al. 2019 (SECRAB) study appears to be a strong candidate. You'll need to perform the PubMed search to confirm and access the paper.**

If you can provide more information about the specific type of breast cancer (e.g., stage, hormone receptor status, HER2 status), I can refine the search further.

Here's a breakdown of why and what the closest relevant information is:

*   **Dexamethasone monotherapy is not standard:** Modern multiple myeloma treatment rarely uses dexamethasone alone as a primary therapy, especially when other options are available. It's more often used in combination regimens or for palliation in frail patients.
*   **Combination therapies are the focus:** Research is heavily geared toward combination therapies like lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), bortezomib-based regimens, and the addition of monoclonal antibodies like daratumumab to these backbones.

**Closest Relevant Information and Papers:**

1.  **Efficacy of Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is more effective than dexamethasone alone:** Several sources indicate that lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Len+Dex or Rd) is more effective than dexamethasone alone.

    *   **PubMed ID not Available:** The search results indicate ""Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is more effective than dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma regardless of prior thalidomide exposure"" but do not include the specific PubMed ID for this conclusion.
2.  **Case report on dexamethasone monotherapy:** One source is a case report where dexamethasone monotherapy was used.

    *   **Source \[14]**: *Dexamethasone monotherapy in a frail and chemotherapy-ineligible patient with end-stage multiple myeloma*.  This isn't a comparison study but illustrates a *specific* (frail, end-stage) situation where dexamethasone alone was used and the outcome. It's essential to recognize that this is not representative of general treatment recommendations.  This article does not have a pubmed ID available.
3.  **Lenalidomide Monotherapy Studies:** Note that these are different from Dexamethasone monotherapy and not directly comparable to Rd.

    *   **Safety and efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma - PubMed** (PubMed ID not Available): This study looks at lenalidomide *alone*, not dexamethasone alone, and not a direct comparison to Rd. It supports lenalidomide monotherapy as active with acceptable toxicities in relapsed/refractory MM.
4.  **Studies that compare Daratumumab + Rd vs Rd**: There are several studies that compare the addition of Daratumumab to Rd.

    *   **Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma - PubMed** (PMID: 27718785): This study shows that adding daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone significantly improves progression-free survival in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. While it doesn't isolate dexamethasone monotherapy, it highlights the benefit of *adding* to the Rd backbone.
    *   **Overall Survival With Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma (POLLUX): A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase III Trial** (PubMed ID not available): This study also compares DRd to Rd.

*   **Isatuximab Monotherapy vs. with Dexamethasone:** PMID 33661681 discusses a phase 2 study of isatuximab with or without dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory MM. The addition of dexamethasone to isatuximab *increased* response rates and improved survival outcomes.

Therefore, while a direct comparison focusing solely on dexamethasone monotherapy *versus* TD may be lacking, the OPTIMUM trial suggests dexamethasone monotherapy can be a reasonable option. The systematic review indicates TD is superior to thalidomide alone. The isatuximab study highlights the benefit of *adding* dexamethasone to another agent.

Here's a breakdown of what the search revealed and how to interpret it:

*   **Rucaparib Monotherapy Studies:**

    *   **TRIUMPH trial (PubMed search terms suggest it's PMID: 38873972, but I can't definitively confirm without directly accessing PubMed).** This phase II trial investigated rucaparib monotherapy in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) patients with germline HRR mutations. While it showed clinical responses, it didn't meet the pre-specified efficacy threshold, and enrollment was truncated.
    *   **ROAR study (PubMed search terms suggest it's PMID: 38692543, but I can't definitively confirm without directly accessing PubMed).** This phase II study looked at rucaparib monotherapy in non-metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with ""BRCAness"" genotype. It demonstrated acceptable toxicity and efficacy signals as an ADT-sparing approach.

*   **Enzalutamide Monotherapy Studies:**

    *   **Long-term Efficacy and Safety of Enzalutamide Monotherapy in Hormone-naïve Prostate Cancer (PubMed search terms suggest it's PMID: 25687533).** This study showed long-term reductions in PSA and a favorable safety profile in men with hormone-naïve prostate cancer.

*   **Combination Studies (Rucaparib + Enzalutamide):**

    *   **CASPAR Trial (A031902):** This Phase III trial (NCT04455750) is evaluating the combination of rucaparib and enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). It does NOT directly compare the two as monotherapies.

*   **Rucaparib vs. Physician's Choice (TRITON3 trial):**

    *   The TRITON3 trial compared rucaparib monotherapy to physician's choice of therapy (which could include enzalutamide, abiraterone, or docetaxel) in mCRPC patients with BRCA or ATM mutations. The rPFS was significantly improved with rucaparib. This is the closest to a direct comparison, but enzalutamide was only *one* of the possible ""physician's choice"" options in the comparator arm.

*   **General Trends:** Several studies suggest Nedaplatin may be a promising alternative to Cisplatin due to potentially similar efficacy but with fewer side effects in treating Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC).
*   **Efficacy:**

    *   A randomized Phase III controlled trial indicated Nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was non-inferior to Cisplatin-based CCRT for stage II-IVB NPC patients regarding 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). Updated 5-year follow-up results supported these initial findings.
    *   Another study found no significant difference in 3- and 5-year overall survival, progression-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and locoregional relapse-free survival between Cisplatin-based chemotherapy and other platinum-based chemotherapies (including Nedaplatin).
    *   One study found that complete response rates were slightly lower with lobaplatin compared to cisplatin and nedaplatin, but the differences weren't statistically significant. Also, estimated five-year overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) weren't statistically significant between three groups
*   **Toxicity:**

    *   Cisplatin is associated with increased acute and late toxicities during radiotherapy, like severe gastrointestinal reactions, renal toxicity, and ototoxicity.
    *   Nedaplatin is associated with less nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to cisplatin. However, some studies showed a higher frequency of severe grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in the Nedaplatin group.

*   **Specific Paper:**

    *   One paper directly compares the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, nedaplatin, and lobaplatin concurrently with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Due to the number of studies found, I cannot identify the *single* paper that *best* describes the efficacy. However, based on the search results, the following paper seems particularly relevant, as it directly compares the efficacy and toxicity of Cisplatin and Nedaplatin:
