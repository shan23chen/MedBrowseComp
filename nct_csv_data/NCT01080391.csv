NCT01080391,"Study Comparing Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone (CRd) vs Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (Rd) in Subjects With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01080391,,COMPLETED,The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival in adults with relapsed multiple myeloma who are receiving CRd vs participants receiving Rd in a randomized multicenter setting.,YES,Relapsed Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Carfilzomib,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) or all-cause death. PD was assessed using International Myeloma Working Group-Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC). One or more conditions were required to meet PD: 2 consecutive rising serum or urine M-protein from central lab; documented new bone lesion(s) or soft tissue plasmacytoma(s) or increased size of existing bone lesion(s) or plasmacytoma(s); or confirmed hypercalcemia due solely to plasma cell proliferative disorder (local lab greater than 11.5 mg/dL on 2 separate occasions). Censoring conditions (censoring dates) were: no post-baseline disease assessment (DA) (randomization date); started non-protocol systemic anticancer treatment before PD or death (last DA date before such treatment); died or had PD after more than 1 missed DA (last DA date without PD before the first missed visit); or were alive and without documentation of PD, including lost to follow-up without PD (last DA date)., From randomization through the data cutoff date of 16 June 2014. Median follow-up time was approximately 31 months.","Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the duration from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants who were still alive were censored at the date when the participant was last known to be alive or the data cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier., From randomization through the data cutoff date of 28 April 2017 for the final analysis of overall survival; median follow up time was 67.1 months in each treatment group.|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved either a confirmed stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) as their best response based on the Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed response outcome. Response was determined using the International Myeloma Working Group - Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC)., From randomization through the data cutoff date of 16 June 2014. Median follow-up time was approximately 31 months.|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), minimal response (MR), or stable disease (SD) lasting â‰¥ 8 weeks according to International Myeloma Working Group - Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC) (MR was determined using European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria)., From randomization through the data cutoff date of 16 June 2014. Median follow-up time was approximately 31 months.|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DOR) was calculated for participants who achieved a best response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR). Duration of response was defined as the time in months from the initial start of response (PR or better) to the earlier of documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. Participants who had not progressed or died were censored according to the censoring rules defined previously for PFS., From randomization through the data cutoff date of 16 June 2014. Longest follow-up time was approximately 42 months.|Duration of Disease Control, Duration of disease control (DDC) was calculated for participants who achieved disease control. DDC was defined as the time in months from randomization to the earlier of documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. Participants who had not progressed or died were censored according to the censoring rules defined previously for PFS., From randomization through the data cutoff date of 16 June 2014. Longest follow-up time was approximately 46 months.|Quality of Life Core Module (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scores, Health-related quality of life was assessed with the use of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Module (QLQ-C30) questionnaire, a validated instrument in multiple myeloma patients. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health related quality of life., Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), Day 1 of Cycles 3, 6, 12, 18",,Amgen,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,792,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,PX-171-009,2010-07-14,2014-06-16,2017-12-05,2010-03-04,2015-07-08,2022-09-21,"Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Providence St. Joseph Medical Center, Burbank, California, 91505, United States|St. Jude Hospital Yorba Linda dba; St. Joseph Heritage Healthcare, Santa Rosa, California, 94503, United States|Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Cancer and Blood Disease Center, Lecanto, Florida, 34461, United States|Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States|Indiana University Health Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160, United States|The University of Michigan - Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, 07601, United States|NYU Clinical Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10016, United States|Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, 10021, United States|Associates in Oncology and Hematology, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37404, United States|The Don & Sybil Harrington Cancer Center, Amarillo, Texas, 79106, United States|Baylor Sammons Cancer Center, Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, 75390-8565, United States|The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Scott and White Memorial Hospital, Temple, Texas, 76508, United States|Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States|Medizinische Universitat Wien, Wien, 1090, Austria|Wilhelminspital der Stadt Wien, Zentrum fur Onkologie und Hamatologie, Wien, 1171, Austria|Ziekenhuisnetwerk Antwerpen - AZ Stuivenberg, Antwerpen, 2060, Belgium|AZ Sint-Jan AV, Brugge, 8000, Belgium|UZ Brussel, Brussels, 1090, Belgium|Institut Jules Bordet, Bruxelles, 1000, Belgium|Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Bruxelles, 1200, Belgium|UZ Leuven, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment, ""Dr. Georgi Stranski"", Pleven, 5800, Bulgaria|University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment ""Sveti Georgi"", Plovdiv, 4002, Bulgaria|Military Medical Academy Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment, Sofia, 1606, Bulgaria|Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Sofia, 1756, Bulgaria|Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment ""Sveta Marina"", Varna, 9010, Bulgaria|Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|University of Alberta, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 1M9, Canada|Cancer Care Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|General Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, A1B 3V6, Canada|Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|McGill University Health Center, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1A1, Canada|Sir Mortimer B.
