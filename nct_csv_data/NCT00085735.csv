NCT00085735,Comparison of Radiation Therapy Regimens in Combination With Chemotherapy in Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Standard-Risk Medulloblastoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00085735,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial is studying how well standard-dose radiation therapy works compared to reduced-dose radiation therapy in children 3-7 years of age AND how well standard volume boost radiation therapy works compared to smaller volume boost radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy in treating young patients who have undergone surgery for newly diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, cisplatin, lomustine, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving radiation therapy with chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether standard-dose radiation therapy is more effective than reduced-dose radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy after surgery in treating young patients with medulloblastoma.",YES,Medulloblastoma,DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Craniospinal Irradiation|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|RADIATION: Involved-Field Radiation Therapy|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Lomustine|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate,"Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS was defined as the time interval from date of study entry to date of disease progression, disease recurrence, second malignant neoplasm or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, or to the date of last follow-up for patients without events. EFS was estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 3-year estimates are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI's)., Assessed at 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time interval from date of study entry to date of death from any cause or to the date of last follow-up for survivors. OS was estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 3-year estimates are reported with 95% CI's. For purposes of this analysis, arms I, III and V (involved field radiation therapy \[IFRT\]) are combined and compared to arms II, IV and VI (posterior fossa irradiation \[PFRT\])., 3 years","Local Posterior Fossa (LPF) Failure Rate, LPF failure was defined as tumor recurrence/progression within the tumor bed. The cumulative incidence (CI) of LPF failure was estimated; 3-year estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Patients with other failure types (e.g., NPF) and with other events prior to LPF failure (e.g., death, second malignancy) were considered as having competing events., 3 years|Non-local Posterior Fossa (NLPF) Failure Rate, NLPF failure was defined as tumor recurrence/progression outside the radiation therapy clinical target volume boost (CTV-boost) but within the posterior fossa CTV (CTV-PF). The cumulative incidence (CI) of NLPF failure was estimated; 3-year estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Patients with other failure types (e.g., NPF, LPF) and with other events prior to NLPF failure (e.g., death, second malignancy) were considered as having competing events., 3 years|Non-posterior Fossa (NPF) Failure Rate, NPF failure was defined as tumor recurrence within the neuroaxis but outside the radiation therapy clinical target volume (CTV). The cumulative incidence (CI) of NPF failure was estimated; 3-year estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Patients with other failure types (e.g., LPF failure) and with other events prior to NPF failure (e.g., death, second malignancy) were considered as having competing events., 3 years|Post-treatment Endocrine Function by CSI Group, Post-treatment endocrine function was measured by laboratory assessment of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The mean TSH will be reported., Up to 3 years|Post-treatment Grade 3+ Hearing Loss as Measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version (v)4, Proportions of patients with grade 3+ hearing loss after the completion of therapy will be calculated and reported separately for low dose craniospinal irradiation (LDCSI) versus (vs.) standard dose craniospinal irradiation (SDCSI) patients. Eligible and evaluable patients 3-7 years of age will be used., Up to 3 years|Post-treatment Neurocognitive Function as Measured by the Estimated Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) by CSI Group Within Time Window 1 (4 - 15 Months Post Diagnosis)., Post-treatment neurocognitive function was assessed. Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) is a representative measurement for neurocognitive function. FSIQ was measured by IQ tests. Assessments within the time window, from eligible and evaluable patients are reported. The time window is 4-15 months post diagnosis, only the assessments before progression date were reported. The Range of FSIQ is 50-150. A higher FSIQ is better., 4 -15 months post diagnosis|Post-treatment Neurocognitive Function as Measured by the Estimated Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) by CSI Group Within Time Window 2 (27 - 48 Months Post Diagnosis), Post-treatment neurocognitive function was assessed. Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) is a representative measurement for neurocognitive function. FSIQ was measured by IQ tests. Assessments within the time window, from eligible and evaluable patients are reported. The time window is 27-48 months post diagnosis, only the assessments before progression date were reported. The range of FSIQ is 50 - 150. A higher FSIQ is better., 27 - 48 months post diagnosis|Post-treatment Neurocognitive Function as Measured by the Estimated Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) by CSI Group Within Time Window 3 (49 - 72 Months Post Diagnosis), Post-treatment neurocognitive function was assessed. Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) is a representative measurement for neurocognitive function. FSIQ was measured by IQ tests. Assessments within the time window, from eligible and evaluable patients are reported. The time window is 49-72 months post diagnosis, only the assessments before progression date were reported. The Range of FSIQ is 50-150. A higher FSIQ is better., 49 - 72 months post diagnosis|Incidence of Grade 3+ Hearing Loss at 1-year Post Treatment as Assessed by CTCAE v4, Proportions of patients with grade 3+ hearing impairment as assessed by CTCAE v4 at 1-year post treatment were calculated., Up to 3 years|Incidence of Endocrine Dysfunction as Measured by Growth Hormone Stimulation Tests at the Time of Completion of Therapy by Radiotherapy (RT) Group, Endocrine dysfunction was assessed by growth hormone stimulation (GHS) tests. We report the percentage of patients with abnormal growth hormone stimulation tests., Post-treatment up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS) by Molecular Subgroup Based on Methylation Arrays, OS was defined as the time interval from date of study entry to date of death from any cause or to date of last contact for survivors.
