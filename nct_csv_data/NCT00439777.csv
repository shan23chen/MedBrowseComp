NCT00439777,Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor Rivaroxaban in Patients With Acute Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism - The EINSTEIN PE Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00439777,,COMPLETED,"This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, event-driven, non-inferiority program for efficacy with a study treatment duration of 3, 6 or 12 months in patients with confirmed acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) with or without symptomatic Deep-Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (Einstein-PE).",YES,Pulmonary Embolism,"DRUG: Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)|DRUG: Enoxaparin overlapping with and followed by VKA","Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism [VTE] (i.e. the Composite of Recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis [DVT] or Fatal or Non-fatal Pulmonary Embolism [PE]) Until the Intended End of Study Treatment, All events were adjudicated and confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment. Events were assessed based on either compression ultrasound (for DVT), venography (for DVT), spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning (for PE), pulmonary angiography (for PE), ventilation/perfusion lung scan (for PE), lung scintigraphy (for PE), autopsy (for fatal PE) or unexplained death for which DVT/PE could not be ruled out (for fatal PE), and/or case summaries., 3-, 6-, or 12-month study treatment period","Percentage of Participants With the Composite Variable Comprising Recurrent DVT, Non-fatal PE and All Cause Mortality Until the Intended End of Study Treatment, All events were adjudicated and confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment.

Major bleeding was overt bleeding associated with 2 g/dL or greater fall in hemoglobin, leading to a transfusion of ≥2 units, occurring in a critical site or contributing to death.

Clinically relevant bleeding included major bleeding (overt bleeding associated with 2 g/dL or greater fall in hemoglobin, leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, occurring in a critical site or contributing to death) and non-major bleeding associated with medical intervention, unscheduled physician contact, (temporary) cessation of study treatment, discomfort for the participants such as pain, or impairment of activities of daily life., 3-, 6- or 12-month study treatment period|Percentage of Participants With All Deaths, All events were adjudicated and confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment.
