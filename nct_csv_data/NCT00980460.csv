NCT00980460,Risk-Based Therapy in Treating Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Liver Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00980460,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase III trial studies the side effects and how well risk-based therapy works in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed liver cancer. Surgery, chemotherapy drugs (cancer fighting medicines), and when necessary, liver transplant, are the main current treatments for hepatoblastoma. The stage of the cancer is one factor used to decide the best treatment. Treating patients according to the risk group they are in may help get rid of the cancer, keep it from coming back, and decrease the side effects of chemotherapy.",YES,PRETEXT I Hepatoblastoma|PRETEXT II Hepatoblastoma|PRETEXT III Hepatoblastoma|PRETEXT IV Hepatoblastoma,DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Dexrazoxane|DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Irinotecan Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|PROCEDURE: Liver Transplantation|DRUG: Temsirolimus|PROCEDURE: Therapeutic Conventional Surgery|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate,"Event-free Survival, Estimated 5-year EFS where EFS is calculated as the time from study enrollment to disease progression, disease relapse, occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm, death from any cause or last follow-up whichever occurs first. Kaplan-Meier method is used for estimation. Patients without an event are censored at last contact., Time from patient enrollment to progression, treatment failure, death from any cause, diagnosis of a second malignant neoplasm, or last follow-up, assessed up to 5 years|Number of Cycles on Which Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events Coded According to CTC AE Version 5 Were Observed, All grade 3 or 4 or greater non-hematological toxicities. The frequency of each toxicity type will be quantified as the number of reporting periods on which the toxicity of the relevant grade is reported. This measure does not apply to patients enrolled in the VERY LOW RISK group., During protocol therapy up to 1 year after enrollment|Number of Deaths, Number of patients who experience on-protocol-therapy death possibly, probably or likely related to systemic chemotherapy. This outcome measure applies to INTERMEDIATE RISK patients only., During protocol therapy or within 30 days of the termination of protocol therapy up to 1 year after enrollment|Disease Status at the End of 2 Courses of Therapy, RECIST v 1.1 and serum alphafetoprotein responses are evaluated separately. RECIST v 1.1 complete response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is defined as reduction of at last 30% in the sum of the longest dimension of all target lesions (CR and PR measured by CT or MRI) between enrollment. Serum alphafetoprotein response is a decrease of at least 90% from the last serum alphafetoprotein measurement from the baseline prior to the start of chemotherapy to the end of cycle 2. This is calculated for HIGH RISK regimen W and HIGH RISK regimen H only., First two cycles of therapy- up to 42 days after enrollment","Feasibility of Referral for Liver Transplantation, A patient for whom referral is considered appropriate who receives a consultation after enrollment will be considered a success with respect to feasibility., 3 cycles of therapy -
