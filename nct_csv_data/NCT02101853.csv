NCT02101853,Blinatumomab in Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02101853,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,This randomized phase III trial studies how well blinatumomab works compared with standard combination chemotherapy in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). Immunotherapy with blinatumomab may allow the body's immune system to attack and destroy some types of leukemia cells. It is not yet known whether blinatumomab is more effective than standard combination chemotherapy in treating relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,YES,Recurrent B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Asparaginase|BIOLOGICAL: Blinatumomab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Leucovorin Calcium|DRUG: Mercaptopurine|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride|DRUG: Pegaspargase|OTHER: Pharmacological Study|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Therapeutic Hydrocortisone|DRUG: Thioguanine|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate,"Disease Free Survival (DFS) of High-risk (HR) and Intermediate-risk (IR) Relapse Patients, DFS rates of HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following Induction Block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR Randomization). DFS is calculated as the time from randomization to date of first event (treatment failure, relapse, second malignancy, remission death) or date of last contact. Two-year DFS estimates will be calculated from date of randomization for both Arm A and Arm B. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated., Up to 2 years from date of randomization|Disease Free Survival (DFS) of Low Risk (LR) Relapse Patients, DFS rates of LR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following Block 1 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab (LR Randomization). DFS is calculated as the time from randomization to date of first event (relapse, second malignancy, remission death) or date of last contact. Three-year DFS estimates will be calculated from date of randomization for both Arm C and Arm D. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated., Up to 3 years from date of randomization","Overall Survival (OS) of HR and IR Relapse Patients, OS rates of HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following Induction Block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR Randomization).

In addition, a population PK approach using a non-linear mixed effect model will also be used to assess blinatumomab PK. Exposure-response analyses will be performed to explore associations among blinatumomab exposure, relevant clinical covariates and clinical measures of safety and efficacy., Days 2 and 14 of cycle 1",National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE3,669,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2014-00631|NCI-2014-00631|s15-00970|COG-AALL1331|AALL1331|AALL1331|U10CA180886|U10CA098543,2014-12-17,2021-06-30,2025-09-18,2014-04-02,2022-12-06,2025-03-25,"Children's Hospital of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|USA Health Strada Patient Care Center, Mobile, Alabama, 36604, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Banner Children's at Desert, Mesa, Arizona, 85202, United States|Phoenix Childrens Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona, 85016, United States|Banner University Medical Center -
