NCT03850444,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy for Participants With Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)-Positive Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-042/KEYNOTE-042)-China Extension Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03850444,,COMPLETED,"In the China extension study, Chinese participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be randomized to receive single agent pembrolizumab for up to 35 treatments or standard of care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel or carboplatin + pemetrexed for 4 to 6 21-day cycles). Chinese participants in the platinum-based chemotherapy arms with non-squamous tumor histologies may receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy after the 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary extension study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival (OS) compared to SOC chemotherapy in Chinese participants.",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: pemetrexed,"Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With a Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50%, OS was determined for participants with a TPS of ≥50% and was defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.

Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or progression in non-target lesions was also considered PD.

ORR was determined per RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1.
