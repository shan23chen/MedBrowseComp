NCT00004067,Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Plus Paclitaxel With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Node-Positive Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00004067,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone for treating breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together with trastuzumab works compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating women with node-positive stage II or stage IIIA breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.",NO,Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: herceptin|DRUG: adriamycin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: taxol,"Disease Free Survival (DFS), Breast cancer recurrence, second primary cancer, death from any cause as first event, Time from randomization through 5 years|Cardiotoxicity, time from randomization through 4 months","Survival, Death from any cause., time from randomization through 5 years|Long term effect of trastuzumab on cardiac function, Ejection fraction will be measured by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA)., At 5 and 10 years after randomization",,NSABP Foundation Inc,National Cancer Institute (NCI),FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,2130,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NSABP B-31|CDR0000067269,2000-02,2005-03,2019-11,2003-01-27,,2021-04-29,"Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Huntsville, Alabama, 35801, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99519-6604, United States|CCOP - Western Regional, Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006-2726, United States|City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, 91010-3000, United States|Sutter Health Western Division Cancer Research Group, Greenbrae, California, 94904, United States|Scripps Cancer Center at Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|Loma Linda University Cancer Institute at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, 92354, United States|Pacific Shores Medical Group Comprehensive Hematology-Oncology Services - Long Beach, Long Beach, California, 90813, United States|CCOP - Bay Area Tumor Institute, Oakland, California, 94609-3305, United States|Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, 92868, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Center at Desert Regional Medical Center, Palm Springs, California, 92262, United States|Sutter Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|Kaiser Permanente Medical Center/Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego, San Diego, California, 92120, United States|CCOP - Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|Kaiser Permanente Medical Center - Vallejo, Vallejo, California, 94589, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center at University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado, 80010, United States|CCOP - Colorado Cancer Research Program, Incorporated, Denver, Colorado, 80209-5031, United States|Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut, 06360-7106, United States|Helen and Harry Gray Cancer Center at Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut, 06102-5037, United States|CCOP - Christiana Care Health Services, Wilmington, Delaware, 19899, United States|Morton Plant Hospital, Clearwater, Florida, 33756, United States|Halifax Medical Center, Daytona Beach, Florida, 32114, United States|Baptist Cancer Institute - Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida, 32207, United States|CCOP - Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, 33140, United States|University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|M.D. Anderson Cancer Center - Orlando, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Cancer Research Network, Inc., Plantation, Florida, 33324, United States|Florida Cancer Specialists, Sarasota, Florida, 34236, United States|Phoebe Cancer Center at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Albany, Georgia, 31701, United States|Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|CCOP - Atlanta Regional, Atlanta, Georgia, 30342-1701, United States|MBCCOP-Medical College of Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia, 30912-4000, United States|Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, 30905-5650, United States|Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813, United States|North Idaho Cancer Center, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 83814, United States|John H.
