NCT00453154,"Cisplatin or Carboplatin, and Etoposide With or Without Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00453154,,COMPLETED,"This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of sunitinib malate and to see how well it works when given together with cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide are more effective when given with or without sunitinib malate in treating small cell lung cancer.",YES,Extensive Stage Lung Small Cell Carcinoma|Recurrent Lung Small Cell Carcinoma,DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Etoposide|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Placebo Administration|DRUG: Sunitinib Malate,"Maximum Tolerated of Sunitinib Combined With Cisplatin and Etoposide (Phase I), The maximum tolerated dose is defined at the highest sunitinib dose at which less than one third of participants develop a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). A DLT is defined as: delay of beginning cycle 2 of chemotherapy by \> 7 days due to neutropenia, grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting greater than 1 week (chemotherapy alone would be expected to cause significant grade 4 hematologic toxicity) or grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding grade 3 or 4 fatigue if the patient is found to be hypothyroid and responds to fatigue \< grade 3 with thyroid replacement therapy)., 21 days|Progression-free Survival (Phase II), Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from maintenance randomization to progression or death of any cause. Progression free and alive patients were censored at the date of last follow-up. The median PFS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method., Up to 3 years","Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause. Surviving patients were censored at the date of last follow-up. The median OS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method., Up to 3 years|Number of Participants With Overall Tumor Response, Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria. Overall tumor response is the total number of CR and PRs., Up to 3 years","Change in Plasma Levels of VEGF Prior to, During Single-agent, and Following Treatment With Sunitinib Malate, The frequency of tumor response by the optimally dichotomized VEGF levels will be tabulated and their association will be tested by Fisher's exact test as well as the maximally selected rank test. The association of the VEGF levels as continuous predictor with tumor response will be tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Further assessments of the association of the VEGF levels as\> continuous or binary variables and the tumor response will be implemented in a logistic regression while adjusting for other covariates such as performance status, weight loss and age, Baseline to within 7 days of sunitinib/placebo therapy discontinuation|Change in Plasma Levels of PDGF, Correlated with clinical outcome (response and survival)., Baseline to within 7 days of sunitinib/placebo therapy discontinuation",National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,156,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",NCI-2009-00465|NCI-2009-00465|CDR0000538229|CALGB 30504|CALGB-30504|U10CA180821|U10CA031946,2007-03-15,2013-06-30,2015-08-20,2007-03-28,2015-04-14,2023-04-04,"Arroyo Grande Community, Arroyo Grande, California, 93420, United States|PCR Oncology, Arroyo Grande, California, 93420, United States|East Bay Radiation Oncology Center, Castro Valley, California, 94546, United States|Valley Medical Oncology Consultants-Castro Valley, Castro Valley, California, 94546, United States|Bay Area Breast Surgeons Inc, Emeryville, California, 94608, United States|Valley Medical Oncology Consultants-Fremont, Fremont, California, 94538, United States|Contra Costa Regional Medical Center, Martinez, California, 94553-3156, United States|El Camino Hospital, Mountain View, California, 94040, United States|Highland General Hospital, Oakland, California, 94602, United States|Alta Bates Summit Medical Center -
