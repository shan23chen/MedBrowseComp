NCT03257267,Study of Cemiplimab in Adults With Cervical Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03257267,,COMPLETED,"The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who have histology of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and who have any eligible histology treated with either cemiplimab or investigator's choice (IC) chemotherapy.

The secondary objectives performed among SCC patients and among all eligible histologies (SCC and adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma (AC) are:

* To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy
* To compare objective response rate (ORR) (partial response \[PR\] + complete response \[CR\]) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1
* To compare the duration of response (DOR) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy
* To compare the safety profiles of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy by describing adverse events (AE)
* To compare quality of life (QOL) for patients treated with cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)",YES,"Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)|Recurrent or Metastatic, Platinum-refractory Cervical Cancer",DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Investigator Choice (IC) Chemotherapy,"Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. A participant who had not died was censored at the last known date of contact., From first dose up to 90 following last dose (~42 months)|Overall Survival (OS) in the SCC Population, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. A participant who had not died was censored at the last known date of contact., From first dose up to 90 following last dose (~42 months)","Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed by Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression (radiographic) or death due to any cause. Participants who did not have a documented tumor progression or death were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment., Time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause (assessed up to 40 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Assessed by Investigator Using RECIST 1.1, ORR was defined as the number of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per RECIST 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeters (mm) (\<1 centimeter \[cm\]). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From date of randomization up to 40 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Assessed Per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from the date of first response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented progressive disease (per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm (\<1 cm). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Participants who never progressed while being followed was censored at the last valid tumor measurement. DOR was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimate., Time from the date of first response to the date of the first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause (up to 40 months)|Quality of Life (QoL): Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) of Global Health Status /Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) and Physical Functioning Scales, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall QoL in cancer participants. It consisted of 15 domains: 1 GHS/QoL scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial impact). Most items are scored 1 (""not at all"") to 4 (""very much"") except for the items contributing to the GHS/QoL, which are scored 1 (""very poor"") to 7 (""excellent""). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100. For the GHS/QoL and 5 functional scales a high score indicates better global health status/functioning and a negative change from baseline indicated less improvement. For the symptom scales, a high score indicates a higher level of symptoms, and a negative change from baseline indicated an improvement in symptoms., From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 40 months (Each cycle = 42 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, and TEAEs Leading to Death, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as those that are not present at baseline or represent the exacerbation of a pre-existing condition during the on-treatment period. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life- threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious TEAEs. Number of participants with TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to death were reported., From first dose up to 90 following last dose (~36 months)|Number of Participants With New or Worsened Laboratory Results by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI-CTCAE) Grade, Laboratory parameters included hematology, electrolytes, chemistry (other), and liver function. Clinically significant abnormalities were determined by the investigator based on NCI-CTCAE Grade where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe; Grade 4 = life threatening or disabling; Grade 5 = death. Participants with at least 1 lab abnormality Graded 3/4 in hematology, electrolytes, chemistry (other), or liver function reported., From first dose up to 90 following last dose (~36 months)",,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,Sanofi,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,608,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,R2810-ONC-1676|2017-000350-19,2017-09-05,2021-03-15,2023-04-20,2017-08-22,2022-04-06,2024-07-29,"Arizona Oncology Associates, Phoenix, Arizona, 85016, United States|Arizona Oncology Associates, Tucson, Arizona, 85711, United States|University of California Irvine, Orange, California, 92868, United States|Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70121, United States|Cancer Research for the Ozarks, Springfield, Missouri, 65804, United States|New York Presbyterian Queens, Flushing, New York, 11355, United States|Northwell Health, Lake Success, New York, 11042, United States|Laura and Issac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone, New York, New York, 10016, United States|First Health of the Carolinas Outpatient Cancer Center, Pinehurst, North Carolina, 28374, United States|Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107, United States|Texas Oncology, P.A., Austin, Texas, 78745, United States|St. George Hospital, Kogarah, New South Wales, 2217, Australia|Northern NSW Health District, The Tweed Hospital, Tweed Heads, New South Wales, 2485, Australia|Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital, Herston, Queensland, 4011, Australia|Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, 03000, Australia|Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia, 6009, Australia|St. John of God Subiaco Hospital, Subiaco, Western Australia, 6008, Australia|OLV ziekenhuis Aalst, Medische oncologie- Radiotherapie, Aalst, 9300, Belgium|Institut Bordet, Brussels, 1000, Belgium|Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Bruxelles, 1200, Belgium|UZLeuven Gynaelologic Oncology, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|CHC Saint Joseph, Liège, 4000, Belgium|CHU Liège, Liège, 4000, Belgium|CHU UCL Namur site Sainte Elisabeth, Namur, 5000, Belgium|Liga Norte Riograndense Contra o Câncer, Natal, Rio Grande Do Norte, 59075-740, Brazil|Hosptial Sao Lucas da PUC de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande Do Sul, 09619-900, Brazil|Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande Do Sul, 90035-072, Brazil|Centro de Novos Tratamentos Itajai, Itajai, Santa Catarina, 88301-220, Brazil|Fundação Pio XII -
