NCT02383966,Phase III Trial to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Cetuximab for the Treatment of Chinese Participants With Head and Neck Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02383966,CHANGE2,COMPLETED,This trial aimed to assess efficacy and safety of cetuximab when given in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in Chinese participants with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) as the first-line treatment.,YES,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell of Head and Neck",DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Cisplatin/Carboplatin|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time, as Assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS time was defined as the time in months from the date of randomization until first observation of PD (based on imaging as assessed by IRC), or death due to any cause when death occurs within 60 days after the last tumor assessment or randomization (whichever is later). PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on trial; and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter. PFS was measured using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates., Every 6 weeks starting from the date of randomization until occurrence of PD, assessed up to data-cutoff (904 days)","Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time, as Assessed by the Investigator, PFS time was defined as the time in months from the date of randomization until first observation of PD (radiologically confirmed by Investigator), or death due to any cause when death occurs within 60 days after the last tumor assessment or randomization (whichever is later). PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on trial; and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter. PFS was measured using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates., Every 6 weeks starting from the date of randomization until occurrence of PD, assessed up to data-cutoff (904 days)|Overall Survival (OS) Time, The OS time was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. If a participant was alive at the time of analysis, survival time was censored at the last date when the participant was known to be alive. If this date was after data cut-off, participants were censored at the date of data cut-off. OS was measured using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates., Time from date of randomization up to data cutoff (assessed up to 904 days)|Best Overall Response Rate (ORR), The Best ORR was based on imaging and classified according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria. The BOR rate was defined as the number of participants whose BOR was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), relative to the number of participants belonging to the trial set of interest. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must had reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Every 6 weeks starting from the date of randomization until occurrence of PD, assessed up to data-cutoff (904 days)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR was based on imaging and classified according to RECIST Version 1.1 criteria. The DCR was defined as the number of participants whose Best Overall Response is either CR, PR or stable disease (SD), divided by the number of participants belonging to the trial set of interest multiplied by 100. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must had reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on trial., Every 6 weeks starting from the date of randomization until occurrence of PD, assessed up to data-cutoff (904 days)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was determined for participants whose BOR was either CR or PR. It was defined as the time from the first assessment of CR or PR until the event defining PFS time. PFS time was defined as the time in months from the date of randomization until first observation of PD (based on imaging as assessed by IRC), or death due to any cause when death occurs within 60 days after the last tumor assessment or randomization (whichever is later). CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must had reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Every 6 weeks starting from the date of randomization until occurrence of PD, assessed up to data-cutoff (904 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Death and AEs Leading to Discontinuation, An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state up to 30 days after last administration. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs., Time from date of randomization up to data cutoff (assessed up to 904 days)",,"Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,243,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EMR062202-060,2015-07-31,2018-01-19,2021-12-20,2015-03-10,2019-04-16,2022-05-13,"Research site, Darmstadt, Germany","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/66/NCT02383966/Prot_001.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/66/NCT02383966/SAP_000.pdf"
