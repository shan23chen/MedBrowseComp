NCT00208546,"Cetuximab, Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab in Advanced Colorectal Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00208546,,COMPLETED,"This is a study to assess the efficacy and safety of the addition of cetuximab to the combined regimen of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab in patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal carcinoma. It is an open, comparative study, comparing the effects of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab to those of the same regimen plus cetuximab.

Seven hundred fifty patients will be included. Treatment will continue until disease progression or serious toxicity and follow up will continue until death. It is anticipated that the addition of cetuximab will lead to an increase in progression free survival.",NO,Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: 21Capecitabine + bevacizumab + oxaliplatin|DRUG: 1Capecitabine + oxaliplatin + bevacizumab + cetuximab,"progression free survival, study duration|toxicity, study duration","tumour response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]), study duration|response duration, study duration|overall survival, study duration|quality of life, study duration|translational research, study duration",,Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group,Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds|Sanofi|Roche Pharma AG|Immunicon,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,750,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CAIRO2,2005-06,2009-07,2009-12,2005-09-21,,2012-02-02,"University Medical Center Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Gelderland, Netherlands",
