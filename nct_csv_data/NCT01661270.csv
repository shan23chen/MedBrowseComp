NCT01661270,A Study of Aflibercept Versus Placebo With FOLFIRI in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Previously Treated With an Oxaliplatin Chemotherapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01661270,AFLAME,COMPLETED,"Primary Objective:

To evaluate the improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of aflibercept versus placebo in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with FOLFIRI as second-line treatment for metastatic disease.

Secondary Objectives:

To compare the overall survival (OS) in the 2 treatment arms. To compare the overall response rate (ORR) in the 2 treatment arms. To assess the safety profile of the 2 treatment arms. To assess immunogenicity of intravenous (IV) aflibercept in selected centers.",YES,Colorectal Cancer Metastatic,DRUG: Aflibercept|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of first observation of either tumor progression or death due to any cause. Tumor assessment was performed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Progression was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study or absolute increase and at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. PFS was calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimates., 26.7 months","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored at the earliest between the last date of the participants was known to be alive and the study cut-off date. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method., 31.6 months|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response rate was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), as assessed by Investigators and the IRC according to RECIST 1.0 criteria, relative to the total number of participants in the relevant analysis population. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions but persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease (PD) and no new lesions., 26.6 months",,Sanofi,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,332,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",EFC11338|U1111-1115-7227,2012-07,2014-10,2015-07,2012-08-09,2015-11-26,2016-10-18,"Investigational Site Number 156003, Beijing, 100071, China|Investigational Site Number 156001, Beijing, 100142, China|Investigational Site Number 156002, Beijing, 100210, China|Investigational Site Number 156004, Beijing, 100853, China|Investigational Site Number 156016, Chengdu, 610041, China|Investigational Site Number 156020, Chongqing, 400038, China|Investigational Site Number 156021, Fuzhou, 350014, China|Investigational Site Number 156008, Guangzhou, 510060, China|Investigational Site Number 156010, Hangzhou, 310003, China|Investigational Site Number 156011, Hangzhou, 310009, China|Investigational Site Number 156009, Hangzhou, 310016, China|Investigational Site Number 156015, Harbin, 150081, China|Investigational Site Number 156012, Nanjing, 210002, China|Investigational Site Number 156013, Nanjing, 210029, China|Investigational Site Number 156006, Shanghai, 200032, China|Investigational Site Number 156007, Shanghai, 200032, China|Investigational Site Number 156014, Shenyang, 110001, China|Investigational Site Number 156005, Tianjin, 300060, China|Investigational Site Number 156019, Wuhan, 430022, China|Investigational Site Number 156018, Wuhan, 430030, China|Investigational Site Number 156017, Xi'An, 710032, China|Investigational Site Number 344002, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Investigational Site Number 344001, Shatin, Nt, Hong Kong|Investigational Site Number 392006, Amagasaki-Shi, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392003, Bunkyo-Ku, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392004, Bunkyo-Ku, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392009, Gifu-Shi, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392002, Kitaadachi-Gun, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392001, Kobe-Shi, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392005, Kochi-Shi, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392007, Kumamoto-Shi, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392008, Nagakute-Shi, Japan|Investigational Site Number 392010, Takatsuki-Shi, Japan|Investigational Site Number 702002, Singapore, 119228, Singapore|Investigational Site Number 702001, Singapore, 169610, Singapore|Investigational Site Number 158003, Taipai, 10043, Taiwan|Investigational Site Number 158002, Taipei, Taiwan",
