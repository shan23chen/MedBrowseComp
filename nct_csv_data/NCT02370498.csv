NCT02370498,A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Paclitaxel for Participants With Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma That Progressed After Therapy With Platinum and Fluoropyrimidine (MK-3475-061/KEYNOTE-061),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02370498,,COMPLETED,"This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab (MK-3475) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for participants with tumors that show positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.
