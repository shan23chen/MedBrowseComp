NCT02622321,"A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Prophylactic Emicizumab Versus no Prophylaxis in Hemophilia A Participants With Inhibitors",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02622321,HAVEN 1,COMPLETED,"This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of prophylactic emicizumab treatment in participants previously treated with episodic or prophylactic bypassing agents. Episodic bypassing agent participants will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) versus no prophylaxis (Arm B) and will be stratified across Arms A and B according to the number of bleeds they experienced over the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (less than \[\<\] 9 or greater than or equal to \[\>/=\] 9 bleeds); Arm B participants will have the opportunity to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after at least 24 weeks on-study. Prophylactic bypassing agent participants will switch to emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm C) from the start of the trial; enrollment will be extended for 24 weeks after the last participant has enrolled in Arms A or B or until approximately 50 participants have enrolled in Arm C, whichever occurs first. Episodic bypassing agent participants who previously participated in the non-interventional study BH29768 (NCT02476942) who were unable to enroll in Arms A or B, or participants on prophylactic bypassing agents who were unable to enroll in Arm C, prior to their closure will have the opportunity to enroll in Arm D. Like participants in Arms A and C, Arm D participants will receive emicizumab prophylaxis from the start of the trial. All participants will continue to receive episodic bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, preferably with recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa).",YES,Hemophilia A,DRUG: Emicizumab|DRUG: rFVIIa|DRUG: aPCC,"Model-Based Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) for Treated Bleeds, Arm A: Emicizumab Versus Arm B: No Prophylaxis, The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an annualized bleed rate (ABR) using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times.

For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose., 1-12, 13-24, 25-36, 37-48, 49-60, 61-72, 73-84, 85-96, 97-108, 109-120, 121-132, 133-144, 145-156, 157-168, 169-180, 181-192, 193-204, 205-216, 217-228, and 229-240 weeks|Safety Summary of the Overall Number and Percentage of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event, Severity Assessed According to the WHO Toxicity Grading Scale, Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. The WHO toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE severity (i.e., intensity of an AE); any AEs not specifically listed in the WHO toxicity grading scale were assessed for severity according to the following grades: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death. Regardless of severity, some AEs may have also met seriousness criteria. The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" are not synonymous; severity and seriousness were independently assessed for each AE. For participants whose emicizumab dose was up-titrated, only data before up-titration is included. aPCC = activated prothrombin complex concentrate; Hypersens.= hypersensitivity, From Baseline until study completion (median [min-max] safety observation period for all participants: 133.97 [0.1-249.1] weeks)|Number of Participants Testing Negative or Positive for the Presence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs), Including Neutralizing ADAs, During the Study, 'Total ADA Negative' is the sum of all subjects who tested negative for ADA in the 2 following categories: 'ADA Negative', those who are pre-dose ADA negative or are missing pre-dose ADA data and who have all negative post-dose ADA results; and 'ADA Negative (Treatment Unaffected)', a subset who are pre-dose ADA positive but do not have a ≥4-fold increase in post-dose ADA levels compared to baseline measurement. 'Total ADA Positive' is the sum of all subjects who tested positive for ADA in the 2 following categories: 'ADA Positive (Treatment Boosted)', those who are pre-dose ADA positive and have a ≥4-fold increase in post-dose ADA levels compared to baseline measurement; and 'ADA Positive (Treatment Induced)', those who are pre-dose ADA negative or missing data and who have at least one post-dose ADA positive sample. ADA-positive samples were further analyzed for neutralizing capacity using a modified FVIII chromogenic assay; if also positive, they were considered neutralizing ADAs., From Baseline until study completion (median [min-max] safety observation period for all participants: 133.97 [0.1-249.1] weeks)|Plasma Trough Concentrations of Emicizumab at Specified Timepoints, Plasma concentrations of emicizumab were analyzed using a validated Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Because participants in Arm B switched from episodic bypassing agents to start receiving emicizumab prophylaxis after Week 24, the timepoints for Arm B (Emi) are expressed relative to first emicizumab dose., Pre-dose (0 hour [hr]) on Weeks 1-5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 33, 41, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97, 109, 121, 133, 145, 157, and 169 (For Arm B (Emi), Study Weeks are relative to first emicizumab dose)",,Hoffmann-La Roche,Chugai Pharmaceutical,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,113,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,BH29884|2015-002866-21,2015-11-18,2016-10-25,2020-12-01,2015-12-04,2017-11-24,2021-06-24,"Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, 90010, United States|Santa Monica Oncology Center, Santa Monica, California, 90403, United States|University of Colorado Denver, Children's Hospital, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Boston Childrens Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Children's Hospital of Michigan; Pediatrics, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Cornell Univ Medical College; Hematology-Oncolog, New York, New York, 10021, United States|Oregon Health & Science Uni ; Dept of Pediatrics, Portland, Oregon, 97201, United States|Pennsylvania State Hershey Medical Center; Division of Hematology/Oncology, H046, Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033-0850, United States|Univ of TX Health Science Ctr; Gulf States Hemo and Throm Ctr, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Bloodworks Northwest (formerly Puget Sound Blood Center); Hemophilia, Seattle, Washington, 98104, United States|Royal Prince Alfred Hospital; Haematology, Camperdown, New South Wales, 2050, Australia|The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne; Thrombosis and Haemostasis Unit, Melbourne, Victoria, 3004, Australia|ICIC, San Jose, 1000, Costa Rica|Hopital Cardio-vasculaire Louis Pradel; Hemostase clinique, Bron, 69677, France|CH de Bicetre; Centre de Traitement d' Hemophilie, Le Kremlin Bicetre, 94275, France|Hopital Cardiologique; Hematologie B, Lille, 59037, France|Groupe Hospitalier Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, 75015, France|Universitätsklinikum Bonn; Institut für Experimentelle Hämatologie und Transfusionsmedizin, Bonn, 53127, Germany|CTC North GmbH & Co.
