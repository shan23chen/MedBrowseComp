Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. The final analysis of PFS in the global cohort was pre-specified after approximately 497 BICR PFS events occurred across the D + SoC and SoC alone treatment arms (75% maturity)., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Week 6, Week 12 and then every 8 weeks relative to date of randomization until radiological progression. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 24 July 2019 (maximum of approximately 25 months).|Overall Survival (OS); D + SoC Compared With SoC Alone, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. The final analysis of OS in the global cohort was pre-specified after approximately 532 OS events occurred across the D + SoC and SoC alone treatment arms (80% maturity)., From baseline until death due to any cause. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 12 March 2021 (maximum of approximately 45 months).","PFS; T + D + SoC Compared With SoC Alone and T + D + SoC Compared With D + SoC, PFS (per RECIST 1.1 using BICR assessments) was defined as time from date of randomization until date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Week 6, Week 12 and then every 8 weeks relative to date of randomization until radiological progression. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 24 July 2019 (maximum of approximately 25 months.|OS; T + D + SoC Compared With SoC Alone and T + D + SoC Compared With D + SoC, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline until death due to any cause. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 12 March 2021 (maximum of approximately 45 months).|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR (per RECIST 1.1 using BICR assessments) was defined as the percentage of patients with at least one visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Results are presented for the pre-specified ORR analysis using unconfirmed responses based on BICR., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Week 6, Week 12 and then every 8 weeks relative to date of randomization until radiological progression. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 24 July 2019 (maximum of approximately 25 months).|Best Objective Response (BoR), The BoR was calculated based on the overall visit responses from each RECIST 1.1 assessment. BOR was defined as the best response a patient had following randomization, but prior to starting any subsequent cancer therapy and up to and including RECIST 1.1 progression or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST 1.1 progression, as determined by BICR. Categorization of BoR was based on RECIST using the following 'response' categories: CR and PR and the following 'non-response' categories: stable disease (SD) ≥6 weeks, progression (ie, PD) and not evaluable (NE). Results are presented for number (%) of patients in each specified category., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Week 6, Week 12 and then every 8 weeks relative to date of randomization until radiological progression. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 24 July 2019 (maximum of approximately 25 months).|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR (per RECIST 1.1 using BICR assessments) was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. The end of response coincided with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the RECIST 1.1 PFS endpoint. The time of the initial response was defined as the latest of the dates contributing towards the first visit of PR or CR. Results are presented for the pre-specified DoR analysis using unconfirmed responses based on BICR., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Week 6, Week 12 and then every 8 weeks relative to date of randomization until radiological progression. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 24 July 2019 (maximum of approximately 25 months).|Time From Randomization to Second Progression (PFS2), PFS2 was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest of the progression event (subsequent to that used for the primary variable PFS) or death. The date of second progression was recorded by the Investigator and defined according to local standard clinical practice and could involve any of: objective radiological imaging, symptomatic progression or death., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Week 6, Week 12 and then every 8 weeks relative to date of randomization until radiological progression. Assessed until global cohort DCO of 24 July 2019 (maximum of approximately 25 months).|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Durvalumab; Peak and Trough Serum Concentrations, To evaluate PK, blood samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints and peak and trough serum concentrations of durvalumab were determined. Peak concentration on Week 0 is the post-infusion concentration of Week 0 (collected within 10 minutes of the end of infusion). Trough concentrations on Weeks 3 and 12 are the pre-infusion concentrations of Weeks 3 and 12, respectively., Samples were collected post-dose on Day 1 (Week 0), pre-dose on Weeks 3 and 12 and at follow-up (3 months after the last valid dose). Assessed at the global cohort DCO of 12 March 2021.|PK of Tremelimumab; Peak and Trough Serum Concentrations, To evaluate PK, blood samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints and peak and trough serum concentrations of tremelimumab were determined.

Trough concentrations on Weeks 3 and 12 are the pre-infusion concentrations of Weeks 3 and 12, respectively., Samples were collected post-dose on Day 1 (Week 0), pre-dose on Weeks 3 and 12 and at follow-up (3 months after the last valid dose). Assessed at the global cohort DCO of 12 March 2021.|Number of Patients With Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Response to Durvalumab, Blood samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints and number of patients who developed detectable ADAs against durvalumab was determined. ADA prevalence is defined as percentage of patients with positive ADA result at any time, baseline or post-baseline. Treatment-emergent ADA is defined as either treatment-induced ADA or treatment-boosted ADA. ADA incidence is percentage of patients who were treatment-emergent ADA-positive.

It assesses HRQoL/health status through 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), and a global health and QoL scale. 6 single-item symptom measures are also included: dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties. Scores from 0 to 100 were derived for each of the 15 domains, with higher scores representing greater functioning, greater HRQoL, or greater level of symptoms. Time to deterioration was defined as time from randomization until the date of first clinically meaningful deterioration that was confirmed at a subsequent visit or death (by any cause) in the absence of a clinically meaningful deterioration., At baseline, Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 20, then Q4W until PD, on Day 28 and 2 months post-PD, then every 8 weeks until second progression/death (whichever came first). Assessed until global cohort DCO of 12 March 2021 (maximum of approximately 45 months).|Time to Deterioration of PRO Symptoms, Assessed Using EORTC QLQ-Lung Cancer Module 13 (QLQ-LC13), The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a disease-specific 13-item self-administered questionnaire for lung cancer, to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30. It comprises both multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (ie, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and treatment-related symptoms from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (ie, hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia). Scores from 0 to 100 were derived for each symptom item, with higher scores representing greater level of symptoms. Time to deterioration was defined as time from randomization until the date of first clinically meaningful deterioration that was confirmed at a subsequent visit or death (by any cause) in the absence of a clinically meaningful deterioration., At baseline, Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 20, then Q4W until PD, on Day 28 and 2 months post-PD, then every 8 weeks until second progression/death (whichever came first).
