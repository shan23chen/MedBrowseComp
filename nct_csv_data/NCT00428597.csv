NCT00428597,A Study Of Sunitinib Compared To Placebo For Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Islet Cell Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00428597,,TERMINATED,"This study randomized patients with advanced pancreatic islet cell tumors to receive either sunitinib or placebo. Patients who were randomized to sunitinib received 37.5 mg of sunitinib daily, those randomized to placebo received a tablet that looked similar but had no active drug. Neither the patient or the doctor knew whether the patient was receiving sunitinib or placebo. Patients were followed to determine the status and size of their tumors, survival, quality of life and safety of the drug.

The study was designed to detect a 50% improvement in median PFS\[Progression Free Survival\] with 90% power and was to enroll 340 subjects. An interim analysis was planned when 130 events had occurred, and the final analysis was to be conducted when 260 events had occurred.

Study A6181111 was stopped early during the enrollment period because of a clear and clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy for the sunitinib treatment arm as recommended by the DMC \[Data Monitoring Committee\]. The actual number of subjects enrolled was 171 and the actual number of PFS events recorded was 81 PFS events. The decision to terminate the study was not based on safety concerns related to sunitinib administration.",YES,"Carcinoma, Islet Cell|Carcinoma, Pancreas",DRUG: sunitinib malate|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization to first progression of disease (PD) or death for any reason in the absence of documented PD. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus first randomization date +1) divided by 30.4., From time of randomization through Day 1 of Week 5, Week 9, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression or death","Number of Subjects With Objective Response, Objective response = subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for at least 4 weeks, confirmed by repeat tumor assessments. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.
