NCT04035486,A Study of Osimertinib With or Without Chemotherapy as 1st Line Treatment in Patients With Mutated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (FLAURA2),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04035486,FLAURA2,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The reason for the study is to find out if an experimental combination of an oral medication called osimertinib (TAGRISSO®) when used in combination with chemotherapy is more effective than giving osimertinib alone for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for their patients. One type of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).

Osimertinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Unfortunately, despite the benefit observed for patients treated with osimertinib, the vast majority of cancers are expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining osimertinib with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer.

In total the study aims to enroll approximately 586 patients, consisting of approximately 30 patients who will participate in a safety run-in component of the trial, and approximately 556 who will receive osimertinib alone or osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the main trial. In the main part of the trial there is a one in two chance of receiving osimertinib alone, and the treatment is decided at random by a computer.

The study involves a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst receiving study medication, it is expected patients will attend, on average, approximately 15 visits over the first 12 months and then approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending on the arrangement of medical assessments by the study centre.",YES,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: Pemetrexed/Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin,"Adverse Events Graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event v5 (Safety Run-In Treatment Arms Only), Adverse events were summarized by maximum reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) grade, version 5.0.

Questions are combined to produce symptom scales, individual symptom items, functional scales, and global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL).

Positive change from baseline scores on the GHS/QoL and functioning scales indicate improvement on health status/function, and negative change scores on symptom scales/items represent less symptom severity/improvement on symptom status.

Scores range from 0-100 after a linear transformation.

Time to deterioration (TTD) is defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first clinically meaningful worsening (a change in the score from baseline of ≥10) that is confirmed at a subsequent assessment or death in the absence of a clinically meaningful symptom, function, or global health status/QoL worsening, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from study treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to symptom, function or GHS/QoL deterioration.

While the QLQ-LC13 includes more scales, only the Coughing, Pain in chest, and Dyspnea subscale scores were analyzed for this endpoint.

Negative change from baseline scores indicates less symptom severity, and thus improvement on health status.
