NCT00718549,A Study to Assess the Effect of Maintenance Treatment With Rituximab Versus No Treatment in Participants With Progressive B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00718549,,COMPLETED,"This study will assess the effect of maintenance treatment with rituximab in comparison with observation period (no treatment), in participants with progressive B-cell CLL who have had previous first-line induction treatment with rituximab, cladribine and cyclophosphamide (RCC regimen). After 6 months of RCC induction therapy, participants will be randomized either to receive maintenance treatment with rituximab or to receive no treatment (observation only) for 96 weeks. Participants completing maintenance/observation period will be followed-up for approximately 3 years.",YES,"Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic",DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Rituximab,"Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression (PD), Relapse, or Death Due to Any Cause Assessed According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Revised Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), PD occurred if any of the following events was observed: appearance of any new lesion, such as enlarged lymph nodes (greater than \[\>\]1.5 centimeters \[cm\]), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or other organ infiltrates; an increase of greater than or equal to (\>/=) 50 percent (%) in greatest determined diameter of any previous site; an increase in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen by \>/=50%; an increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by \>/=50% with B-lymphocytes \>/=5000 per microliter (/mcL); transformation to a more aggressive histology; occurrence of cytopenia (neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia) attributable to CLL., From randomization to PD, Relapse, or death due to any cause (overall approximately 5 years)|Progression-Fee Survival (PFS) Assessed According to the NCI Revised Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of CLL, PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of PD, relapse, or death due to any cause.
