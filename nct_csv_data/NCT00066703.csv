NCT00066703,Triptorelin With Either Exemestane or Tamoxifen in Treating Premenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00066703,TEXT,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using triptorelin, exemestane, and tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin together with exemestane is more effective than triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying triptorelin and exemestane to see how well they work compared to triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: exemestane|DRUG: tamoxifen|DRUG: triptorelin,"Disease-free Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where disease-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first appearance of one of the following: invasive breast cancer recurrence at local, regional, or distant site, invasive contralateral breast cancer, second (non-breast) invasive cancer, or death without cancer event; or censored at date of last follow up., 5-year estimate reported at a median follow-up of 72 months","Breast Cancer-free Interval, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where breast cancer-free interval is defined as the time from randomization to the invasive breast cancer recurrence at local, regional, or distant site, or invasive contralateral breast cancer; or censored at date of last follow up., 5-year estimate reported at a median follow-up of 72 months|Distant Recurrence-free Interval, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where distant recurrence-free interval is defined as the time from randomization to breast cancer recurrence at a distant site; or censored at date of last follow-up, 5-year estimates reported at a median follow-up of 72 months|Overall Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive at 8 years from randomization, where overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause; or censored at date last known alive., 8-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 9 years",,ETOP IBCSG Partners Foundation,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Breast International Group,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,2672,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IBCSG 25-02 / BIG 3-02|IBCSG 25-02|BIG 3-02|NABCI IBCSG 25-02|EU-20347|2004-000168-28|CDR0000316458,2003-11-03,2011-03-11,2024-10-23,2003-08-07,2016-04-05,2025-03-26,"Roy and Patricia Disney Family Cancer Center at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center, Burbank, California, 91505, United States|Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093-0658, United States|Providence Holy Cross Cancer Center, Mission Hills, California, 91346-9600, United States|Desert Regional Medical Center Comprehensive Cancer Center, Palm Springs, California, 92262, United States|Sutter Cancer Center at Roseville Medical Center, Roseville, California, 95661, United States|Sutter Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|Mercy General Hospital, Sacramento, California, 95819, United States|UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, California, 94115, United States|Ruby L.
