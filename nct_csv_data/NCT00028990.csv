NCT00028990,Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00028990,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel works better with or without bevacizumab in treating breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is to see if paclitaxel works better with or without bevacizumab in treating patients who have locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Progression-Free Survival, Assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years",,,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|North Central Cancer Treatment Group|NCIC Clinical Trials Group|NSABP Foundation Inc,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,722,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000069156|E2100|NCCTG-E2100|CAN-NCIC-MAC3|NSABP-E2100,2002-01-29,2006-11,2009-05,2003-01-27,,2023-06-15,"MBCCOP - Gulf Coast, Mobile, Alabama, 36607, United States|CCOP - Mayo Clinic Scottsdale Oncology Program, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259-5404, United States|Mayo Clinic - Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|CCOP - Atlanta Regional, Atlanta, Georgia, 30342-1701, United States|CCOP - Illinois Oncology Research Association, Peoria, Illinois, 61602, United States|CCOP - Carle Cancer Center, Urbana, Illinois, 61801, United States|CCOP - Cedar Rapids Oncology Project, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 52403-1206, United States|CCOP - Iowa Oncology Research Association, Des Moines, Iowa, 50309-1016, United States|Siouxland Hematology-Oncology, Sioux City, Iowa, 51101-1733, United States|CCOP - Ochsner, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70121, United States|CCOP - Michigan Cancer Research Consortium, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48106, United States|CCOP - Duluth, Duluth, Minnesota, 55805, United States|Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|CentraCare Health Plaza, Saint Cloud, Minnesota, 56303, United States|CCOP - Metro-Minnesota, Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, 55416, United States|CCOP - Missouri Valley Cancer Consortium, Omaha, Nebraska, 68106, United States|Medcenter One Health System, Bismarck, North Dakota, 58501-5505, United States|CCOP - Merit Care Hospital, Fargo, North Dakota, 58122, United States|Altru Cancer Center, Grand Forks, North Dakota, 58201, United States|CCOP - Dayton, Dayton, Ohio, 45429, United States|CCOP - Toledo Community Hospital, Toledo, Ohio, 43623-3456, United States|CCOP - Oklahoma, Tulsa, Oklahoma, 74136, United States|CCOP - Geisinger Clinic and Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17822-2001, United States|Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15212-4772, United States|CCOP - Upstate Carolina, Spartanburg, South Carolina, 29303, United States|Rapid City Regional Hospital, Rapid City, South Dakota, 57709, United States|CCOP - Sioux Community Cancer Consortium, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 57104, United States|CCOP - St. Vincent Hospital Cancer Center, Green Bay, Green Bay, Wisconsin, 54301, United States|British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|Allan Blair Cancer Centre, Regina, Saskatchewan, S4T 7T1, Canada",
