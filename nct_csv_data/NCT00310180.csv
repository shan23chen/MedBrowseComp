NCT00310180,Hormone Therapy With or Without Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women Who Have Undergone Surgery for Node-Negative Breast Cancer (The TAILORx Trial),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00310180,TAILORx,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies the best individual therapy for women who have node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer by using a special test (Oncotype DX), and whether hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy together with combination chemotherapy is better for women who have an Oncotype DX recurrence score of 11-25. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells or by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving hormone therapy together with more than one chemotherapy drug (combination chemotherapy) has been shown to reduce the chance of breast cancer recurrence, but the benefit of adding chemotherapy to hormone therapy for women with node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer is small. New tests may provide information about which patients are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy.",YES,Breast Adenocarcinoma|Hormone Receptor Positive|Stage IA Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IB Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIA Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIB Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIIB Breast Cancer AJCC v7,DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Exemestane|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Letrozole|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Tamoxifen Citrate,"5-year Disease-free Survival, Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined to be time from randomization to first event, where the first event is any of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral second primary invasive cancer, second primary non-breast invasive cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers), or death without evidence of recurrence. The distribution of DFS (eg, 5-year DFS rate) is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and compared between the two randomized arms (arm B vs. arm C) using stratified log rank test and stratified Cox proportional hazard model., Assessed every 6 months within 5 years from registration and then annually up to 20 years, DFS rate estimated at 5 years","5-year Distant Recurrence-free Interval, Distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) is defined as time from date of randomization or registration to the date of distant recurrence of breast cancer, or of death with distant recurrence, if death is the first manifestation of distant recurrence. The distribution of DRFI (eg, 5-year DRFI rate) is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Assessed every 6 months within 5 years from registration and then annually up to 20 years, DRFI rate estimated at 5 years|5-year Recurrence-free Interval, Recurrence-free interval (RFS) is defined as time from date of randomization or registration to the date of first recurrence of breast cancer (ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, local/regional recurrence, distant recurrence) or to the date of death with recurrence, if death is the first manifestation of recurrence. The distribution of RFS (eg, 5-year RFS rate) is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Assessed every 6 months within 5 years from registration and then annually up to 20 years, RFS rate estimated at 5 years|5-year Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as time from date of randomization or registration to date of death from any cause. The distribution of OS (eg, 5-year OS rate) is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Assessed every 6 months within 5 years from registration and then annually up to 20 years, OS rate estimated at 5 years|5-year Disease-free Survival by Age and Recurrence Score Groups, Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined to be time from randomization to first event, where the first event is any of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral second primary invasive cancer, second primary non-breast invasive cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers), or death without evidence of recurrence. DFS is evaluated by recurrence score (0-10 vs. 11-15 vs. 16-20 vs. 21-25 vs. \>25) and age groups (\<=50 vs. 51-65 vs. 65-75). The distribution of DFS (eg, 5-year DFS rate) is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Assessed every 6 months within 5 years from registration and then annually up to 20 years, DFS rate estimated at 5 years|To Compare the Outcomes Projected at 10 Years by Adjuvant!

The distribution of DFS (eg, 5-year DFS rate) is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. 5-year DFS by individual RS gene groups (Proliferation Gene Group, HER2 Gene Group, ER Gene Group, Invasion Gene Group, and Other Genes) will be estimated in each arm., Assessed every 6 months within 5 years from registration and then annually up to 20 years",,National Cancer Institute (NCI),American College of Surgeons|Cancer and Leukemia Group B|NSABP Foundation Inc|NCIC Clinical Trials Group|North Central Cancer Treatment Group|SWOG Cancer Research Network,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,10273,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2009-00707|NCI-2009-00707|ECOG-PACCT-1|06-482|CDR0000472066|PACCT-1|PACCT-1|PACCT-1|U10CA180820|U10CA021115,2006-04-07,2018-03-02,2030-09-30,2006-04-03,2019-03-12,2025-03-27,"Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center, Anniston, Alabama, 36202, United States|University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Mobile Infirmary Medical Center, Mobile, Alabama, 36607, United States|Providence Hospital, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|University of South Alabama Mitchell Cancer Institute, Mobile, Alabama, 36688, United States|Alaska Regional Hospital, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, Fairbanks, Alaska, 99701, United States|Banner Thunderbird Medical Center, Glendale, Arizona, 85306, United States|Banner Desert Medical Center, Mesa, Arizona, 85202, United States|Banner Baywood Medical Center, Mesa, Arizona, 85206, United States|Banner-University Medical Center Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006, United States|Western Regional CCOP, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006, United States|Virginia G Piper Cancer Care-Del Camino, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85258, United States|Banner University Medical Center -
