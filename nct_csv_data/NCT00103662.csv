NCT00103662,Mobilization of Stem Cells With AMD3100 (Plerixafor) in Multiple Myeloma Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00103662,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of AMD3100 (plerixafor) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, generic name of filgrastim) is better than G-CSF alone to mobilize and collect the optimal number of stem cells in multiple myeloma patients for autologous transplantation.",YES,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus plerixafor|DRUG: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus placebo,"Proportion of Participants Achieving a Target of ≥ 6*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg in 2 or Fewer Days of Apheresis., Proportion of participants achieving a target of ≥ 6\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg in 2 or fewer days of apheresis. Central lab data were taken from Days 5 to 6 of the Treatment/Apheresis period. Each participant's value was calculated as the sum of all daily values collected over the 2 apheresis days., up to Day 6","Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment emergent adverse events (AEs). The timeframe for treatment emergent AEs is defined as Day 1 (start of G-CSF Mobilization) to the day before starting chemotherapy (approximately 38 days later). AEs were reported regardless of relationship to study treatment. The investigator graded each AE using the World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Event Grading Scale. AEs of Grade 3 were considered severe and Grade 4 were considered life-threatening., up to Day 38|Proportion of Participants Achieving a Target of ≥ 6*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg in 4 or Fewer Days of Apheresis., Proportion of participants achieving a target of ≥ 6\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer days of apheresis. Central lab data were taken from Days 5 to 8 of the Treatment/Apheresis period. Each participant's value was calculated as the sum of all daily values collected over the 4 apheresis days., up to Day 8|Proportion of Participants Achieving a Target of ≥ 2*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg in 4 or Fewer Days of Apheresis., Proportion of participants achieving a target of ≥ 2\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer days of apheresis. Central lab data were taken from Days 5 to 8 of the Treatment/Apheresis period. Each participant's value was calculated as the sum of all daily values collected over the 4 apheresis days., up to Day 8|Median Number of Days to ≥6*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg, The Kaplan Meier estimate of median number of days (number of days at which 50% of participants have experienced the event, accounting for censored values) in each treatment arm to collect an optimum number of cells (≥6\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg) for transplantation., up to Day 8|Median Number of Days to Polymorphonuclear (PMN) Cell Engraftment, The Kaplan Meier estimate of median number of days to PMN engraftment (number of days at which 50% of participants have experienced the event, accounting for censored values) was a secondary efficacy endpoint. Engraftment was defined as PMN counts ≥ 0.5\*10\^9/L for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 1.0\*10\^9/L for 1 day. Time to engraftment corresponded to the first day that the criteria were met and was evaluated up to 12 months post transplant., Up to Month 13|Median Number of Days to Platelet (PLT) Engraftment, The Kaplan Meier estimate of median number of days to PLT engraftment (number of days at which 50% of participants have experienced the event, accounting for censored values) was a secondary efficacy endpoint. Engraftment was defined as ≥ 20\*10\^9/L without transfusion for the preceding 7 days. Time to engraftment corresponded to the first day that the criteria were met and was evaluated up to 12 months post transplant., Up to Month 13|Graft Durability at 100 Days Post Transplantation, The proportion of participants maintaining a durable graft at 100 days post-transplantation by at least 2 of the following criteria (without erythropoietin (EPO), G-CSF, or transfusions): (1) a platelet count \>50000/µL without transfusion for at least 2 weeks, (2) hemoglobin \>=10g/dL for at least 1 month, (3) and absolute neutrophil count \>1000/µL for at least 1 week., approximately Day 138|Graft Durability at 6 Months Post Transplantation, The proportion of participants maintaining a durable graft at 6 months post-transplantation by at least 2 of the following criteria (without erythropoietin (EPO), G-CSF, or transfusions): (1) a platelet count \>50000/µL without transfusion for at least 2 weeks, (2) hemoglobin \>=10g/dL for at least 1 month, (3) and absolute neutrophil count \>1000/µL for at least 1 week., approximately Month 7|Graft Durability at 12 Months Post Transplantation, The proportion of participants maintaining a durable graft at 12 months post-transplantation by at least 2 of the following criteria (without erythropoietin (EPO), G-CSF, or transfusions): (1) a platelet count \>50000/µL without transfusion for at least 2 weeks, (2) hemoglobin \>=10g/dL for at least 1 month, (3) and absolute neutrophil count \>1000/µL for at least 1 week., approximately Month 13",,"Genzyme, a Sanofi Company",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,302,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",AMD3100-3102|2005-003599-39,2005-01,2006-10,2008-01,2005-02-14,2010-09-29,2014-03-13,"City of Hope Samaritan Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006, United States|Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, 91010, United States|Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|University of California, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Center, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, United States|University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32611, United States|H.
