NCT00412061,Everolimus and Octreotide in Patients With Advanced Carcinoid Tumor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00412061,RADIANT-2,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether everolimus 10 mg / day added to treatment with depot octreotide prolongs progression free survival compared to treatment with octreotide alone in patients with advanced carcinoid tumor.,YES,Carcinoid Tumor|Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome,DRUG: Octreotide|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Everolimus,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Per Adjudicated Central Radiology Review, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause. The primary analysis of PFS was based on the independent central adjudicated assessment using Kaplan-Meier method., Time from randomisation to dates of disease progression, death from any cause or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first patient randomised, 10 January 2007, until cut-off date 02 April 2010","Best Overall Response Rate as Per Adjudicated Central Radiology Review Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), The best overall response rate is defined as the percentage of patients having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response. Complete Response (CR) = at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression. • Partial response (PR) = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression., Time from randomisation to dates of disease progression, death from any cause or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first patient randomised, 10 January 2007, until cut-off date 02 April 2010|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Per Adjudicated Central Review by Baseline 5-hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) Level, 5-HIAA levels in urine are frequently elevated in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. Baseline levels of 5-HIAA in urine were defined as 'High' if they exceeded the median value, and 'Low' if they were lower than or equal to the median., If elevated at baseline, evaluated every cycle visit (28 days/cycle) reported between day of first patient randomised, 10 January 2007, until cut-off date 02 April 2010|Overall Survival Using Kaplan-Meier Methodology, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. If a patient was not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of last contact. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the median overall survival for each treatment group., Months 12, 24, 36, 48|Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs), Clinically Notable AE, Death, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (Double-Blind Phase), AEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. SAEs are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards., From first day of treatment up to 28 days after last day of treatment in double blind|Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs), Clinically Notable AE, Death, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (Open Label Phase), AEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. SAEs are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards., From first day of treatment up to 28 days after last day of treatment in double blind|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Per Adjudicated Central Review by Baseline Chromogranin A (CgA), Serum CgA levels in urine are frequently elevated in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. Baseline levels of serum CgA were characterized relative to the upper limited of normal (ULN). CgA levels exceeding 2 x ULN were considered to be 'Elevated'; otherwise considered as ""Non-elevated""., If elevated at baseline, evaluated every cycle visit (28 days/cycle) reported between day of first patient randomised, 10 January 2007, until cut-off date 02 April 2010",,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,429,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CRAD001C2325|2006-004507-18,2006-12,2010-04,2013-06,2006-12-15,2012-03-12,2014-11-21,"University of Arizona / Arizona Cancer Center Deptof Uof A/Arizona Cancer(2), Tucson, Arizona, 85719, United States|Highlands Oncology Group The Center for Chest Care, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|Hematology Oncology Services of Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Pacific Cancer Medical Center, Inc., Anaheim, California, 92801, United States|Cedars Sinai Medical Center SC-2, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|University of California at Los Angeles UCLA New SC Address, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|University of Colorado Dept. of Univ. of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers Dept of Rocky Mountain (2), Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Eastern Connecticut Hematology & Oncology Associates Dept. of ECHO, Norwich, Connecticut, 06360, United States|Cancer Centers of Connecticut Southington Location, Southington, Connecticut, 06489, United States|Hematology Oncology PC Dept.of Hematology Oncology(2), Stamford, Connecticut, 06902, United States|Ocala Oncology Center Dept. of Ocala Oncology Center, Ocala, Florida, 34471, United States|Cancer Care and Hematology Specialists of Chicagoland Niles, Niles, Illinois, 60714, United States|Indiana University Dept.of IndianaUniv.CancerCtr, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|Central Indiana Cancer Centers CICC - South, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46227, United States|University of Iowa Medical Center Internal Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States|University of Kansas Cancer Center Deptof Uof Kansas CancerCenter, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160, United States|Kansas City Cancer Center KCCC Business Office, Overland Park, Kansas, 66210, United States|Norton Cancer Institute Clinical Research Program, Louisville, Kentucky, 40202, United States|LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER/ LSU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Deptof LSU Health Sciences (2), New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, United States|Mayo Clinic - Rochester Division of Hematology, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Washington University School Of Medicine-Siteman Cancer Ctr Division of Oncology, St. Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|The Center for Cancer Care and Research, St. Louis, Missouri, 63141, United States|Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center Medical Oncology, Lebanon, New Hampshire, 03756, United States|New York Oncology Hematology, P.C.
