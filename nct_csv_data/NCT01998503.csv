NCT01998503,Bortezomib and Dexamethasone Followed by ASCT Compared With ASCT Alone in Treating Patients With AL Amyloidosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01998503,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects and how well giving induction therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) compared with ASCT alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed renal AL amyloidosis. In this prospective, randomized control study, patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis who met the criteria for ASCT were randomized to receive 2 cycles of BD as induction therapy followed by ASCT (BD+ASCT) (arm 1) or to receive ASCT alone as an initial treatment (arm 2). Hematologic and organ responses were evaluated every 3 months after ASCT. All the patients should be followed up for 12 months.",NO,Amyloidosis,DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: dexamethasone|BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|PROCEDURE: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT)|DRUG: Melphalan,"Number of participants with hematologic complete response between BD+ASCT arm and ASCT alone arm in the treatment of AL amyloidosis, 12 months","Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, 12 months|Number of participants with organ responses between BD+ASCT arm and ASCT alone arm in the treatment of AL amyloidosis, 12 months|Overall survival, 24 months|Progression free survival, 24 months",,Nanjing University School of Medicine,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,56,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NJCT-0703,2007-12,2013-06,2013-08,2013-11-29,,2013-11-29,"Research Institute of Nephrology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210002, China",
