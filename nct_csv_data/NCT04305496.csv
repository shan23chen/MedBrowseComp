Items are scored on a 4-point verbal rating scale: ""Not at All,"" ""A Little,"" ""Quite a Bit,"" and ""Very Much"". Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores indicate better unctioning, better HRQoL, or greater level of symptom, Up to Approximately 51 months|The EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup where applicable, 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), and global health status/QoL scale, along with 5 individual item symptom scores (appetite loss, dyspnoea, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhoea. The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual (Fayers et al. 2001).
