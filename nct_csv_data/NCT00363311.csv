The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathologists recommendations for clinical tumor staging were used. T1c = tumor identified by needle biopsy (e.g., because of elevated prostate-specific antigen \[PSA\]); T2 = tumor confined within the prostate; T2a = tumor involves one-half of one lobe, but not both lobes of the prostate., Baseline|Number of Post-baseline Biopsies With the Indicated Change From Baseline in Clinical Stage, All on-study or for-cause biopsies were reviewed and analyzed by a central pathologist. The National Comprehensive Network (NCCN), 2005 clinical practices guidelines in Oncology-prostate cancer were used for clinical tumor staging. T0: no evidence of primary tumor; T1: clinically inapparent tumor, neither palpable nor visible by imaging; T2: tumor confined within the prostate; T3: tumor extends through the prostate capsule; T4: tumor is fixed or invades adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles. A clinical stage of T0 in post-baseline biopsies has been interpreted as ""No Worsening."", Months 0-18|Prostate Volume (PV) LOCF, Prostate volume was determined at baseline, at Year 1.5, and at Year 3.
