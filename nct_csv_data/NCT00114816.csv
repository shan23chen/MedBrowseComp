The study participants are randomly allocated to receive either 3 cycles of docetaxel followed by 3 cycles of CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil) or to receive 3 cycles of docetaxel plus capecitabine followed by 3 cycles of CEX (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and capecitabine). The study participants are required to to have a medium to high risk for breast cancer recurrence. The primary aim of the study is to investigate whether addition of capecitabine to a standard taxane/anthracycline regimen will influence recurrence-free survival.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: docetaxel,Recurrence-free survival,Adverse event rate (CTCAE v. 3.0)|Overall survival,,Finnish Breast Cancer Group,Hoffmann-La Roche|Sanofi|AstraZeneca,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1500,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,FBCG Protocol No. 01-2003|Roche protocol number MO17728,2004-01,,2007-04,2005-06-20,,2007-05-21,"Department of Oncology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland, Helsinki, FIN-00029, Finland",
