Patients will be randomized to receive bosutinib or imatinib for the duration of the study.",YES,"Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson Proto-oncogene (BCR-ABL) Positive",DRUG: Bosutinib|DRUG: Imatinib,"Percentage of Participants With Major Molecular Response (MMR) at Month 12, MMR was defined as a ratio of breakpoint cluster region to abelson (BCR-ABL/ABL) less than or equal to (\<=) 0.1 percent (%) on the international scale (IS) (greater than or equal to \[\>=\] 3 log reduction from standardized baseline in ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL transcripts \[\>=3000 ABL required\]) by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The percentage of participants with MMR at Month 12 are reported., Month 12","Percentage of Participants With Major Molecular Response (MMR) Up to Month 18, MMR was defined as a ratio of BCR-ABL/ABL \<=0.1% on the international scale (\>=3 log reduction from standardized baseline in ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL transcripts \[\>=3000 ABL required\]) by quantitative RT-qPCR. The percentage of participants with MMR for up to Month 18 are reported., Up to Month 18|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Probability of Retaining Major Molecular Response (MMR) at Month 48, The Kaplan-Meier curve was generated based on the first date of MMR until the date of the confirmed loss of MMR or censoring, objectively documented, for responders only. Confirmed loss of MMR was BCR-ABL/ABL IS ratio \>0.1% in association with a \>=5-fold increase in BCR-ABL/ABL IS ratio from the lowest value achieved up to that time-point confirmed by a second assessment at least 28 days later. Treatment discontinuation due to suboptimal response/treatment failure, progressive disease (PD) or death due to PD within 28 days of last dose were considered confirmed loss of MMR. PD was defined as disease progression to accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML., Month 48|Percentage of Participants With Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) Up to Month 12, Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) was based on the prevalence of Ph+ metaphases among cells in metaphase on a bone marrow (BM) aspirate.

The percentage of participants with CCyR for up to Month 12 are reported., Up to Month 12|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Probability of Retaining Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) at Month 48, The Kaplan-Meier curve was generated based on the first date of CCyR until the date of the confirmed loss of CCyR or censoring, objectively documented, for responders only. Confirmed loss of CCyR was the presence of at least one Ph+ metaphase confirmed by a second assessment at least 28 days later. Treatment discontinuation due to suboptimal response/treatment failure, PD or death due to PD within 28 days of last dose were considered confirmed loss of CCyR. PD was defined as disease progression to AP or BP CML., Month 48|Cumulative Incidence of Event Free Survival (EFS) Events, EFS was defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause, transformation to AP or BP at any time, confirmed loss of complete hematologic response (CHR), confirmed loss of CCyR or censoring. Loss of CHR was defined as a hematologic assessment of non-CHR (chronic phase, AP, or BP) confirmed by 2 assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Loss of CHR was defined as appearance of any of the following: WBC count that rises to \>20.0\*10\^9/L, platelet count rises to \>=600\*10\^9/L, appearance of palpable spleen or other extramedullary involvement proven by biopsy, appearance of 5% myelocytes in peripheral blood, appearance of blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood. Loss of CCyR was defined as at least 1 Ph+ metaphase from analysis of \<100 metaphases confirmed by follow up cytogenetic analysis after 1 month. Cumulative incidence of EFS was defined as percentage of participants with EFS event at Month 60 and was adjusted for competing risk of treatment discontinuation without event., Up to Month 60|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the occurrence of death due to any cause or censoring. Kaplan-meier analysis was used for determination of OS. Percentage of participants who were alive were estimated in this outcome measure., Up to Month 60","Summary of Trough Plasma Concentration by Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) of Bosutinib, CCyR was based on the prevalence of Ph+ metaphases among cells in metaphase on a BM aspirate. CCyR was achieved when there was 0% Ph+ metaphases among cells in a BM sample when at least 20 metaphases from a BM sample were analyzed, or MMR if no BM was available. Trough plasma concentration of participants who had CCyR are presented in this outcome measure., Pre-dose on Days 28, 56 and 84|Summary of Trough Plasma Concentration by Major Molecular Response (MMR) of Bosutinib, MMR was defined as a ratio of BCR-ABL/ABL \<=0.1% on the international scale (\>=3 log reduction from standardized baseline in ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL transcripts) by quantitative RT-qPCR. Trough plasma concentration of participants who had MMR are presented in this outcome measure., Pre-dose on Days 28, 56 and 84|Summary of Trough Plasma Concentration by Presence of Grade 1 or Higher Adverse Events (AEs) of Bosutinib, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to maximum severity grading based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Grade 1= mild; Grade 2= moderate; within normal limits, Grade 3= severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; Grade 4= life-threatening or disabling; urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5= death.
