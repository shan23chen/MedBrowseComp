NCT00075764,S0226 Anastrozole With or Without Fulvestrant as First-Line Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00075764,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using drugs such as anastrozole and fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. It is not yet known whether anastrozole is more effective with or without fulvestrant in treating breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving anastrozole together with fulvestrant to see how well it works compared to anastrozole alone as first-line therapy in treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: anastrozole|DRUG: fulvestrant,"Time to Tumor Progression, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target measurable lesions over the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline. Unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease in the opinion of the treating physician. Appearance of any new lesion/site. Death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration. From date of randomization to time of first documentation of progression, symptomatic deterioration or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive and progression free are considered at last date of contact., Every 4 weeks while on treatment. Then every 3 months until progression, then six months for two years then annually until four years or until death, which ever occurs first.","Clinical Benefit (CR, PR, Confirmed or Unconfirmed, or Stable Disease >= 24 Weeks)., Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable, Does not qualify for CR, PR, Progression or Symptomatic Deterioration. Clinical Benefit = CR + PR + Stable \>= 24 weeks, Every 4 weeks while on treatment. Then every 3 months until progression, then six months for two years then annually until four years or until death, which ever occurs first.|Overall Survival, From date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive are censored at last date of contact., Every 4 weeks while on treatment. Then every 3 months until progression, then six months for two years then annually until four years or until death, which ever occurs first.|Number of Patients With Gr 3 Through 5 Adverse Events That Are Related to Study Drugs, Adverse Events (AEs) are reported by CTCAE version 3.0 terminology. For each patient, worst grade of each event type is reported.
