NCT00513955,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00513955,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without bortezomib in treating mantle cell lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying combination chemotherapy and bortezomib to see how well they work compared with combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
