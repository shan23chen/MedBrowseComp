NCT00638690,Abiraterone Acetate in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00638690,,COMPLETED,This is a phase 3 study to compare the clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone with placebo plus prednisone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who have failed one or two chemotherapy regimens. At least one of the previous chemotherapies must have contained docetaxel.,YES,Prostatic Neoplasms,DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Prednisone/prednisolone,"Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Up to 60 months","Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen Progression According to Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group Criteria, The time interval from the date of randomization to the date of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression as defined in the protocol-specific Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criteria, namely, a PSA level of at least 5 ng/ml that has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart., Up to 12 months|Number of Patients Achieving a Prostate-Specific Antigen Decline >=50%, A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as a \>=50% decline from baseline., Up to 12 months|Radiographic Progression-free Survival, Radiographic progression-free survival is based on imaging studies according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): baseline lymph node size must be \>=2.0 cm to be considered a target lesion;
