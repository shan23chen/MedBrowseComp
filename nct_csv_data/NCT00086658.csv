NCT00086658,Intravenous Mepolizumab In Subjects With Hypereosinophilic Syndromes (HES),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00086658,,COMPLETED,"Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disease with broad clinical signs and symptoms which is diagnosed based on a persistent blood eosinophil count of greater than 1500 cells, various end-organ damages (including skin, heart, lung, nervous system and digestive system etc.), and with exclusion of known secondary causes of hypereosinophilia.

HES has a high morbidity/mortality rate. The major treatment of HES has been systemic corticosteroid and other chemotherapeutic drugs (for example, hydroxyurea and interferon) with the intention to lower eosinophil counts and therefore to slow down the progression of disease. Even though corticosteroid and other therapies can effectively reduce eosinophilia in some patients, some may eventually become nonresponsive and intolerable to the amount of side effects of the long-term therapy with these medications.

Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to human interleukin 5 (hIL-5) and inhibits its activity. Previous human experience has shown it has been effective in reducing blood eosinophilia in atopic and HES patients and has alleviated some HES clinical signs and symptoms. This study intends to further evaluate the corticosteroid-sparing and clinical benefit of mepolizumab in HES.",NO,Hypereosinophilia|Hypereosinophilic Syndrome,DRUG: mepolizumab,Proportion of subjects who achieve a total daily prednisone dose of </=10 mg for a period of 8 consecutive weeks,"Assess the effect of mepo in lowering prednisone dose and blood eosinophil count, improving HES-associated skin manifestations, improving quality of life (QoL), safety and tolerability.",,GlaxoSmithKline,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,86,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,100185,2004-03-23,2006-05-01,2006-05-01,2004-07-09,,2020-05-05,"GSK Investigational Site, San Diego, California, 92103, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Denver, Colorado, 80206, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45229, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Nashville, Tennessee, 37203-1424, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84132, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Richmond, Virginia, 23298-0568, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Madison, Wisconsin, 53792, United States|GSK Investigational Site, St Leonards, New South Wales, 2065, Australia|GSK Investigational Site, South Brisbane, Queensland, 4101, Australia|GSK Investigational Site, Melbourne, Victoria, 3050, Australia|GSK Investigational Site, West Perth, Western Australia, 6005, Australia|GSK Investigational Site, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|GSK Investigational Site, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|GSK Investigational Site, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3C 0N2, Canada|GSK Investigational Site, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1V7, Canada|GSK Investigational Site, Hamilton, Ontario, L8N 3Z5, Canada|GSK Investigational Site, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2T3, Canada|GSK Investigational Site, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1A1, Canada|GSK Investigational Site, Lille, 59000, France|GSK Investigational Site, Suresnes, 92150, France|GSK Investigational Site, Muenchen, Bayern, 80802, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Hannover, Niedersachsen, 30625, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Bad Bramstedt, Schleswig-Holstein, 24576, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, 40138, Italy|GSK Investigational Site, Bern, 3010, Switzerland",
