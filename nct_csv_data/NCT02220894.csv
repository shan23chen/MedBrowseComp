NCT02220894,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy for Participants With Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)-Positive Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-042/KEYNOTE-042),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02220894,,COMPLETED,"In this study, participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be randomized to receive single agent pembrolizumab for up to 35 treatments or standard of care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel or carboplatin + pemetrexed for 4 to 6 21-day cycles). Participants in the platinum-based chemotherapy arms with non-squamous tumor histologies may receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy after the 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival (OS) compared to SOC chemotherapy.",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: pemetrexed,"Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With a Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50%, OS was determined for participants with a TPS of ≥50% and was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the interim analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. The OS was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The efficacy hypothesis was analyzed using a sequential testing strategy that involved testing a hypothesis only if the superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was established for all the preceding hypotheses. The order of testing was OS in participants with TPS≥50%, then with TPS≥20%, and finally with TPS≥1%. The OS for participants with a TPS ≥50% is presented., Up to approximately 44 months|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With a Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥20%, OS was determined for participants with a TPS of ≥20% and was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.

Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
