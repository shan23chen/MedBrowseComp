NCT00002597,Radiation Therapy With or Without Antiandrogen Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00002597,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using flutamide, goserelin, and leuprolide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It is not yet known which regimen of antiandrogen therapy is most effective for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without antiandrogen therapy in treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer.",YES,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: flutamide|DRUG: Zoladex|DRUG: Lupron|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Overall Survival Rate (10-year), Overall survival (OS) was calculated from randomization to the date of death from any cause and overall survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., From date of randomization to 10 years","Disease-specific Survival Rate (10 Years), Disease-specific failure is defined as death certified as due to prostate cancer (by central review), death due to complications of treatment (irrespective of malignancy status), death from unknown causes with active malignancy, or death from unknown causes with previously documented relapse (either clinical or biochemical). Survival rates were estimated by means of cumulative incidence functions., From registration to 10 years|Local Progression Rate (10 Years), Local progression defined as documented local progression as determined by clinical exam . Failure rates were estimated by means of cumulative incidence functions., From registration to 10 years|Distant Failure Rate (10 Years), Failure is defined as documented metastatic disease. Failure rates were estimated by means of cumulative incidence functions., From registration to 10 years|Biochemical Failure Rate (10 Years), The Phoenix definition of biochemical failure was used - an increase in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of \>2 ng per milliliter above the nadir. Failure rates were estimated by means of cumulative incidence functions., From registration to 10 years|Clinical Relapse Rate (10 Years), Clinical relapse is defined as local progression or distant metastases. Failure rates were estimated by means of cumulative incidence functions., From registration to 10 years|Second Biochemical Relapse Rate (10 Years), Second biochemical relapse is as defined as follows (after initiation of salvage hormone therapy): A rise in PSA on at least two consecutive cases above the nadir (after initiation of salvage hormone therapy), with the rises in PSA exceeding 1 ng/ml above the nadir; or failure to reach 4 ng/L or less at 18 months. The rates of second biochemical relapse were estimated by means of cumulative incidence functions., From registration to 10 years|Disease-free Survival Rate (10 Years), Disease-free failure is defined as documentation of progression (local progression, distant failure, and biochemical failure) or death from any cause. Disease-free survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., From registration to 10 years|Positive Re-biopsy Rate at Two Years, The rate of prostate rebiopsy at two years is defined as the proportion of patients whose results are positive among all eligible patients who had a repeat biopsy at two years. The rate was estimated separately in each arm., From registration to two years",,Radiation Therapy Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI),MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,2028,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,RTOG-9408|CDR0000063821,1994-10,2011-07,2018-05-14,2004-02-27,2017-06-06,2018-06-14,"University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294-3300, United States|Huntsville Hospital System, Huntsville, Alabama, 35801-4470, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Institute of Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, 35801, United States|MBCCOP - Gulf Coast, Mobile, Alabama, 36688, United States|Alabama Oncology, LLC, Montgomery, Alabama, 36106-2801, United States|Radiation Oncology Associates of West Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 35401, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona, 85724, United States|Mount Diablo Medical Center, Concord, California, 94524-4110, United States|Cancer Center and Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, 91010-3000, United States|California Cancer Center, Fresno, California, 93720, United States|Saint Agnes Cancer Center, Fresno, California, 93720, United States|Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center, Glendale, California, 91204, United States|Sutter Health Western Division Cancer Research Group, Greenbrae, California, 94904, United States|University of California San Diego Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093-0658, United States|Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, 92354, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Long Beach, Long Beach, California, 90822, United States|USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital, Los Angeles, California, 90033-0804, United States|Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, 90095-1781, United States|CCOP - Bay Area Tumor Institute, Oakland, California, 94609-3305, United States|Cancer Care Center, Pomona, California, 91767, United States|Radiation Oncology Center - Sacramento, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|Radiation Medical Group, Inc., San Diego, California, 92101-1492, United States|UCSF Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute, San Francisco, California, 94143-0128, United States|O'Connor Hospital, San Jose, California, 95128, United States|CCOP - Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|Memorial Hospital Cancer Center, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80909, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver, Colorado, 80010, United States|CCOP - Christiana Care Health Services, Wilmington, Delaware, 19899, United States|Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20307-5000, United States|Lykes Center for Radiation Therapy, Clearwater, Florida, 33757-0210, United States|Halifax Medical Center, Daytona Beach, Florida, 32114, United States|Radiation Therapy Associates - Fort Myers, Fort Myers, Florida, 33901, United States|University of Florida Health Science Center, Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0296, United States|Health First Holmes Regional Medical Center, Melbourne, Florida, 32901, United States|CCOP - Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, 33140, United States|dVeterans Affairs Medical Center - Miami, Miami, Florida, 33125, United States|Sylvester Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Baptist Hospital of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33176-2197, United States|Florida Radiation Oncology Group, Orange Park, Florida, 32073, United States|MD Anderson Cancer Center Orlando, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Bay Medical Center, Panama City, Florida, 32401, United States|Gulf Coast Cancer Treatment Center, Panama City, Florida, 32405-4587, United States|Sarasota Radiation and Medical Oncology Center, Sarasota, Florida, 34233, United States|Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare, Tallahassee, Florida, 32308, United States|H.
