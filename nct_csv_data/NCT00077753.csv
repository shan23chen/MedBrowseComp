NCT00077753,EXCLAIM:Extended Prophylaxis for Venous ThromboEmbolism (VTE) in Acutely Ill Medical Patients With Prolonged Immobilization,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00077753,,COMPLETED,"Primary objective:

* To demonstrate the superiority of extended VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40mg sc qd for 28 ± 4 days, compared to placebo, both following 10 ± 4 days of initial treatment with enoxaparin 40mg sc qd

Secondary objectives:

* To assess the reduction in mortality rate at the end of the double-blind treatment period, at 3 (90 ± 10 days) and at 6 (180 ± 10 days) months from the time of entry to the study, in patients on extended prophylaxis
* To assess the incidence of VTE at 3 months (90 ± 10 days) from the time of randomization to the study
* To evaluate the safety of extended enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients with prolonged immobilization. Safety evaluation includes:

  * Major and minor hemorrhage
  * Heparin induced thrombocytopenia
  * Serious adverse events
* To assess differences in levels of health-care utilization and cost between patients receiving extended VTE prophylaxis versus those receiving placebo.",NO,Venous Thromboembolism,DRUG: enoxaparin sodium,During double blind treatment : Cumulative occurrence of VTE assessed by ultrasound for all patients at 28±4 days after randomization (or earlier if symptomatic VTE) and/or V/Q lung scan for symptomatic patients ; Major hemorrhagic complications.,"Occurrence of VTE between Day 1 and Day 90±10, Mortality at the end of Double-Blind Treatment, at 3 and 6 months|Minor plus major hemorrhagic complications during Double-Blind Treatment.",,Sanofi,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,4726,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,XRP4563C_3501,2002-02,2006-10,2007-02,2004-02-16,,2011-01-11,"Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey, United States|Sanofi-Aventis, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Sanofi-Aventis, North Ryde, Australia|Sanofi-Aventis, Vienna, Austria|Sanofi-Aventis, Brussels, Belgium|Sanofi-Aventis, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Sanofi-Aventis, Laval, Canada|Sanofi-Aventis, Bogota, Colombia|Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France|Sanofi-Aventis, Berlin, Germany|Sanofi-Aventis, Mumbai, India|Sanofi-Aventis, Natanya, Israel|Sanofi-Aventis, Milan, Italy|Sanofi-Aventis, Mexico, Mexico|Sanofi-Aventis, Warsaw, Poland|Sanofi-Aventis, Moscow, Russian Federation|Sanofi-Aventis, Johannesburg, South Africa|Sanofi-Aventis, Barcelona, Spain|Sanofi-Aventis, Megrine, Tunisia|Sanofi-Aventis, Guildford, United Kingdom",
