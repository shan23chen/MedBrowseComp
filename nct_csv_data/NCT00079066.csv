NCT00079066,Cetuximab + Best Supportive Care Compared With Best Supportive Care Alone in Metastatic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Positive Colorectal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00079066,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can target tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Best supportive care is the use of drugs and other treatments to improve the quality of life of patients. Combining cetuximab with best supportive care may slow the growth of the tumor and help patients live longer and more comfortably. It is not yet known whether cetuximab combined with best supportive care is more effective than best supportive care alone in treating metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying cetuximab and best supportive care to see how well they work compared to best supportive care alone in treating patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer.",NO,Colorectal Cancer|Quality of Life,BIOLOGICAL: cetuximab|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment,Overall survival,Time to progression|Objective response rate|Quality of life by European Organization for Research of the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire -C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)|Health utilities by Health Utilities Index 13 (HU 13)|Economic evaluation|Safety profile,,NCIC Clinical Trials Group,Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,572,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CO17|CAN-NCIC-CO17|AGITG-CAN-NCIC-CO17|BMS-CA225-025|IMCL-CAN-NCIC-CO17|CDR0000353486,2003-12-30,2006-11-03,2009-02-10,2004-03-09,,2023-08-04,"NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Camperdown, New South Wales, 1450, Australia|Cross Cancer Institute at University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|British Columbia Cancer Agency - Centre for the Southern Interior, Kelowna, British Columbia, V1Y 5L3, Canada|Fraser Valley Cancer Centre at British Columbia Cancer Agency, Surrey, British Columbia, V3V 1Z2, Canada|British Columbia Cancer Agency - Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|British Columbia Cancer Agency - Vancouver Island Cancer Centre, Victoria, British Columbia, V8R 6V5, Canada|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R2H 2A6, Canada|Moncton Hospital, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 6ZB, Canada|Saint John Regional Hospital, Saint John, New Brunswick, E2L 4L2, Canada|Newfoundland Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, St. Johns, Newfoundland and Labrador, A1B 3V6, Canada|Nova Scotia Cancer Centre at Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 2Y9, Canada|Belleville General Hospital, Belleville, Ontario, K8N 5K5, Canada|Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario at Kingston General Hospital, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 5P9, Canada|Grand River Regional Cancer Centre at Grand River Hospital, Kitchener, Ontario, N2G 1G3, Canada|London Regional Cancer Program at London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, N6A 4L6, Canada|R.
