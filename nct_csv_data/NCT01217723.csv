NCT01217723,Thymoglobulin in Unrelated Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Transplantation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01217723,,UNKNOWN,"This is a randomized trial for patients undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) from an unrelated donor. Approximately 50% of the patients enrolled will receive ThymoglobulinÂ® as part of the preparative regimen prior to HPCT. The other 50% of the patients enrolled will receive a standard preparative regimen. Thymoglobulin is known to suppress the types of cells that can cause a transplant complication known as ""chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD)"". The goal of this trial is to find out if adding Thymoglobulin to the preparative regimen will result in a decrease in cGVHD.",NO,Hematologic Malignancies,BIOLOGICAL: Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (Rabbit)|OTHER: Patients will receive a standard preparative regimen (i.e. one that does not contain Thymoglobulin),"Freedom from Chronic GVHD, ""Freedom from Chronic GVHD"" is defined as withdrawal of all systemic immunosuppressive agents and without resumption up to 12 months (a binary endpoint, yes/no), 12 months post transplant","Quality of Life, A series of questionnaires measured at the screening interval (up to 3 months prior to transplant), 6, 12 and 24 months post transplant., Measured at Screening, Month 6, 12 and 24",,McMaster University,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)|Genzyme, a Sanofi Company|The Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,198,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,CBMTG 0801,2010-04,2014-01,2014-01,2010-10-08,,2010-10-08,"Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 1M9, Canada|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 2YA, Canada|Juravinski Hospital & Cancer Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 1C3, Canada|Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada|Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Hopital de l'Enfant Jesus, Montreal, Quebec, G1J 1Z4, Canada|Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, H1T 2M4, Canada|Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1A1, Canada|L'Hotel Dieu de Quebec, Quebec City, Quebec, G1R 2J6, Canada",
