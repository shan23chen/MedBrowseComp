NCT00003596,Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Anal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003596,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug or combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether fluorouracil and mitomycin plus radiation therapy is more effective than fluorouracil and cisplatin plus radiation therapy for anal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fluorouracil and mitomycin plus radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to fluorouracil and cisplatin plus radiation therapy in treating patients with stage II or stage III anal cancer.",NO,Anal Cancer,DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: mitomycin C|RADIATION: radiation therapy,,,,Radiation Therapy Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group|Cancer and Leukemia Group B|SWOG Cancer Research Network|North Central Cancer Treatment Group,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,682,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,RTOG-9811|CDR0000066667|CALGB-89808|ECOG-R9811|NCCTG-R9811|SWOG-R9811|GUMC-00125,1998-10,2005-10,2016-12,2003-01-27,,2017-01-04,"Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, United States|Mobile Infirmary Medical Center, Mobile, Alabama, 36607, United States|Alaska Regional Hospital, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Foundation for Cancer Research and Education, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|CCOP - Mayo Clinic Scottsdale Oncology Program, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Hembree Mercy Cancer Center at St. Edward Mercy Medical Center, Ft.
