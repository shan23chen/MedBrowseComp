NCT03110978,Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy with or Without Nivolumab in Treating Patients with Stage I-IIA or Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03110978,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without nivolumab works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer or cancer that has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better at treating non-small cell lung cancer.",NO,Lung Atypical Carcinoid Tumor|Lung Neuroendocrine Neoplasm|Lung Non-Small Cell Squamous Carcinoma|Minimally Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma|Neuroendocrine Carcinoma|Recurrent Lung Adenocarcinoma|Recurrent Lung Large Cell Carcinoma|Recurrent Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma|Stage I Lung Cancer AJCC V8|Stage IA1 Lung Cancer AJCC V8|Stage IA2 Lung Cancer AJCC V8|Stage IA3 Lung Cancer AJCC V8|Stage IB Lung Cancer AJCC V8|Stage IIA Lung Cancer AJCC V8,BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy,"Event-free survival with events defined as local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastasis, secondary malignancy (including lung cancer), and death, Will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.
