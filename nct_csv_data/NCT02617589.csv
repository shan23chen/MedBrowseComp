NCT02617589,"An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study of Nivolumab Compared to Temozolomide, Each Given With Radiation Therapy, for Newly-diagnosed Patients With Glioblastoma (GBM, a Malignant Brain Cancer)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02617589,CheckMate 498,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients with glioblastoma that is MGMT-unmethylated (the MGMT gene is not altered by a chemical change). Patients will receive Nivolumab every two weeks in addition to radiation therapy, and then every four weeks. They will be compared to patients receiving standard therapy with temozolomide in addition to radiation therapy.",YES,Brain Cancer,DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Radiotherapy,"Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. A participant who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date., up to 3 years","Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression Free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause. Participants who did not have disease progression or who did not die were censored at the date of last tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessment and did not have tumor progression or die were censored at the randomization date. Participants who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression were censored at the last tumor assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Participants who had surgical resection post start of study treatment were censored at the last tumor assessment date prior to initiation of surgical resection. PFS was determined by investigator reported response based on the Radiologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria., From randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause (up to approximately 6 years)|Overall Survival Rate at 24 Months, The overall survival (OS) rate of (nivolumab + radiation therapy) and (temozolomide + radiation therapy) estimated as Kaplan-Meier probability of survival at 24 months. OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. A participant who has not died was censored at the last known alive date., At 24 Months|Overall Survival in Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) High Population, OS in all randomized participants that are tumor mutational burden high.
