NCT03504397,"A Phase 3 Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability Study of Zolbetuximab (Experimental Drug) Plus mFOLFOX6 Chemotherapy Compared to Placebo Plus mFOLFOX6 as Treatment for Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03504397,Spotlight,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"A study of Zolbetuximab (IMAB362) plus mFOLFOX6 versus placebo plus mFOLFOX6 in participants with Claudin 18.2 positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Why was this study being done? SPOTLIGHT was a new clinical study for adult participants who had any of advanced unresectable gastric or GEJ cancer - metastatic gastric or GEJ cancer. These types of cancers had a unique set of proteins (called Claudin 18.2). We may be able to use a treatment that targets the proteins to kill the cancer cells. For participants with one of the types of cancer listed above, mFOLFOX6 (a combination of three chemotherapies known as Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin, and Fluorouracil) was a current treatment option. This study was testing an experimental medicine called Zolbetuximab (IMAB362). Zolbetuximab attached itself to Claudin 18.2 on the cancer cells causing cancer cell death. Participants were assigned to one of two groups by chance and given either: Zolbetuximab with mFOLFOX6; or a placebo with mFOLFOX6. A placebo was a treatment that looks like the experimental medicine, but contained no medicine. The goal of the study was to find out if Zolbetuximab with mFOLFOX6 helped participants to live longer by stopping the cancer from getting worse.",YES,Locally Advanced Unresectable Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma or Cancer|Locally Advanced Unresectable Gastric Adenocarcinoma or Cancer|Metastatic Gastric Adenocarcinoma or Cancer|Metastatic Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma,DRUG: zolbetuximab|DRUG: placebo|DRUG: oxaliplatin|DRUG: folinic acid|DRUG: fluorouracil,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of radiological progressive disease (PD) (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1 by independent review committee \[IRC\]) or death from any cause, whichever was earliest. PD was defined as development of new, or progression of existing metastases to the primary cancer under the study. Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimates was used., From date of randomization until the date of first documented radiological progression or date of death from any cause, whichever occurred first (up to 50 months and 19 days)","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause.

EORTC-QLQ-C30 was a 30-item cancer-specific instrument consisting of 5 functional scales (physical,role,emotional,social \& cognitive), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting,general pain,dyspnea,insomnia,appetite loss,constipation,diarrhea,financial difficulties) \& global health status scale. Most items were scored 1(not at all) to 4(very much) except for items contributing to global health status/QoL, which were scored 1(very poor) to 7(excellent). All raw domain scores were linearly transformed to 0-100scale with higher scores on symptoms indicate worse health state. CMD was defined if a participant's change from baseline exceeded a pre-specified threshold of -13. This was derived from an Exit Survey conducted using Patient Global Impression of Severity/Change(PGIS/PGIC) questionnaires as an anchor for estimating meaningful change.

Most items were scored 1 (""not at all"") to 4 (""very much"") except for the items contributing to the global health status/QoL, which were scored 1 (""very poor"") to 7 (""excellent""). All raw domain scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale with higher scores on symptoms indicate a worse health state.

Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples., Baseline, C1D22, D1 and D22 of C2 through C19, C20D1, C21D1, 30 day follow up, 90 day follow up|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Zolbetuximab in Serum: Trough Concentration (Ctrough), Ctrough was defined as the predose concentration at the end of dosing interval., Predose on C1D22, C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, C9D1|Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA), Immunogenicity will be measured by the number of participants that are ADA positive., Predose on C1D1, C1D22, C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, C9D1, 30-day follow up, 90-day follow up",,"Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,565,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",8951-CL-0301|2017-002567-17|CTR20190258|jRCT2080224032,2018-06-21,2022-09-09,2025-03-31,2018-04-20,2025-03-25,2025-03-25,"University of Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, 85004, United States|The University of Arizona Medical Center, Tucson, Arizona, 85724, United States|CBCC Global Research, Inc. at Comprehensive Blood and Cancer, Bakersfield, California, 93309, United States|City of Hope Nat'l Medical Center, Duarte, California, 91010, United States|St. Jude Hospital Yorba Linda, Fullerton, California, 92835, United States|Pacific Shores Medical Group, Huntington Beach, California, 92648, United States|Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, 92354, United States|The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Los Angeles, California, 90025, United States|University of California Davis, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|University of California - San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Middletown, Connecticut, 07748-3052, United States|Memorial Cancer Institute - West, Hollywood, Florida, 33021, United States|University of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Orlando Health Inc, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Memorial Hospital West, Pembroke Pines, Florida, 33028, United States|Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, Newnan, Georgia, 30265, United States|Northwestern University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|Norton Cancer Institute, Louisville, Kentucky, 40217, United States|University of Maryland Medical Center(UMMC)Transplant Center, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201, United States|Maryland Oncology Hematology, Brandywine, Maryland, 20613, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114-2696, United States|Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Health Partners Institute, Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, 55426, United States|Regions Hospital, Saint Paul, Minnesota, 55101, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Basking Ridge, New Jersey, 07920, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Montvale, New Jersey, 07645, United States|Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, 14263, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Commack, New York, 11725, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Harrison, New York, 10604, United States|Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, 10029-6574, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10065, United States|Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, New York, 11794-9452, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Uniondale, New York, 11553, United States|The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States|Precision Cancer Research -Dayton Physicians Network, Middletown, Ohio, 45042, United States|University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73104, United States|Earle A.
