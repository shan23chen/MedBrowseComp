NCT01659021,Efficacy and Safety of Idelalisib in Combination With Ofatumumab for Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01659021,,TERMINATED,The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of idelalisib to ofatumumab on progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).,YES,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Ofatumumab,"Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the interval from randomization to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause. Definitive disease progression was CLL progression based on standard criteria (other than lymphocytosis alone) as defined by the 2008 update of the International Workshop on CLL guidelines, ie, appearance of any new lesion; increase by ≥ 50% in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of measured lymph nodes (SPD); new or ≥ 50% enlargement of liver or spleen; transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter's or prolymphocytic transformation); reduction in the number of blood cells (cytopenia) attributable to CLL. PFS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)","Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete response or partial response.

* Complete response was defined as no lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly; normal complete blood count; confirmed by bone marrow aspirate \& biopsy.
* Partial response was defined as \>1 of the following criteria: a 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, liver size, spleen size; plus ≥ 1 of the following: ≥ 1500/μL absolute neutrophil count, \> 100000/μL platelets, \> 11.0 g/dL hemoglobin or 50% improvement for either of these parameters without transfusions or growth factors. Overall response rate was analyzed using KM estimates., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)|Lymph Node Response Rate, Lymph node response rate was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of index lymph nodes., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the interval from randomization to death from any cause. Overall survival was analyzed using KM estimates., Randomization to Last Long-Term Follow-Up Visit (up to maximum of 5 years)|Progression-Free Survival in Subgroup of Participants With Chromosome 17p Deletion and/or TP53 Mutation, Progression-free survival in subgroup of participants with chromosome 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation was analyzed using KM estimates., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response and maintain their response for at least 8 weeks (with a 1-week window)., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)",,Gilead Sciences,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,261,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,GS-US-312-0119|2012-001236-65,2012-12-04,2018-08-15,2018-08-15,2012-08-07,2017-03-31,2019-08-14,"City of Hope, Duarte, California, 91010, United States|California Cancer Associates for Research and Excellence (CCARE), Fresno, California, 93720, United States|Kaiser Permanente, San Diego, California, 92120, United States|Coastal Integrative Cancer Care, San Luis Obispo, California, 93401, United States|Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Kaiser Permanente Vallejo Medical Center, Vallejo, California, 94589, United States|Kaiser Permanente of Colorado, Denver, Colorado, 80205, United States|Saint Mary's Regional Cancer Center, Grand Junction, Colorado, 81501, United States|Cancer Specialists of North Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, 32256, United States|Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, 30912, United States|Montgomery Cancer Center, Mount Sterling, Kentucky, 40353, United States|Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, PC, Bethesda, Maryland, 20817, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Washington University Medical Center, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110-1010, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89169, United States|Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York, 10065, United States|Oncology Hematology Care, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, 45242, United States|The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, 43202, United States|Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Upstate Oncology Associates, Greenville, South Carolina, 29601, United States|Tennessee Oncology, PLLC, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37404, United States|Tenessee Oncology, PLLC, Nashville, Tennessee, 37203-1781, United States|Utah Cancer Specialists, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84106, United States|Northwest Medical Specialties, Tacoma, Washington, 98405, United States|Saint George and Sutherland Hospitals, Kogarah, New South Wales, 2217, Australia|Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, 2031, Australia|Westmead Hospital, Westmead, New South Wales, 2145, Australia|Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Queensland, 4029, Australia|Haematology and Oncology Clinics of Australia at Mater, Milton, Queensland, 4064, Australia|Ashford Cancer Centre Research, Ashford, South Australia, 5035, Australia|Box Hill Hospital, Box Hill, Victoria, 3128, Australia|Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, 3199, Australia|Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville, 5011, Australia|Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen, Antwerpen, 2060, Belgium|Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Brussels, 1200, Belgium|Universitair Ziekenhuis Gent, Ghent, 9000, Belgium|Universitaire Ziekenhuis Gasthuisberg, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 2T9, Canada|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|Cancer Care Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|Hopital Regional De Sudbury Regional Hospital (HRSRH) -
