NCT00760877,Nilotinib Versus Standard Imatinib (400/600 mg Every Day (QD)) Comparing the Kinetics of Complete Molecular Response for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Chronic Phase (CML-CP) Pts With Evidence of Persistent Leukemia by Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RQ-PCR),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00760877,,COMPLETED,"The primary goal of this study was to determine the rate of confirmed best cumulative complete molecular response (CMR) within the first year of study therapy with imatinib or nilotinib. The study also explored the impact and significance of the achieved CMR on patient outcomes (progression free survival (PFS), event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), characterized the kinetics of CMR achieved in both treatment arms and after the cross-over.",YES,CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA,DRUG: Nilotinib|DRUG: Imatinib,"Rate of Confirmed Best Cumulative Complete Molecular Response (CMR), The rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR was defined as the number of participants who had confirmed CMR during the first 12 months of treatment after the randomization date. Participants who achieved confirmed best cumulative CMR during the first 12 months were considered responders. Participants who dropped out early or who did not provide sufficient data for any reason were considered to be non-responders. The definition of CMR is undetectable BCR-ABL (fusion gene formed between bcr gene from chromosome 22 and abl gene from chromosome 9) where BCR-ABL ratio in % international scale (IS) ≤ 0.00001 by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) where there was no detectable BCR-ABL and 1) the test had a sensitivity of at least 4.5 logs below the standardized baseline; 2) RQ-PCR negativity was confirmed on the next RQ-PCR sample (usually 3 months later); and 3) the date of confirmed CMR was the date of the first of two negative results with sensitivity \>4.5 logs., 12 months","Rate of Confirmed Best Cumulative CMR, The rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR was defined as the number of participants who had confirmed CMR during the 24, 36 and 48 months post treatment after the randomization date. Participants who achieved confirmed best cumulative CMR during the first 12 months were considered responders. Participants who dropped out early or who did not provide sufficient data for any reason were considered to be non-responders.
