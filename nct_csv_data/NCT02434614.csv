NCT02434614,Induction Chemotherapy Followed by IMRT With or Without Concurrent Chemotherapy in Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02434614,,UNKNOWN,"Several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was superior to radiotherapy alone in the treatment of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Based on these evidences, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with/without sequential chemotherapy has become the standard care for locoregionally advanced NPC. However, most of these evidences of standard treatment for locoregionally advanced NPC were based on the two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy (2DCRT). As the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique has been widely used in the last decades, IMRT improved the treatment outcomes of patients with NPC, especially the local control rate. Currently, more retrospective studies compared the IMRT alone vs. IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy, and reported that concurrent chemotherapy failed to improve survival rates for patients with locoregionally advanced disease, but increased the severity of acute toxicities. People started to reconsider the role of CCRT. Therefore, we propose this randomized phase III non-inferiority study to reassess the efficacy and contribution of concurrent chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced NPC during IMRT era.",NO,Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"DRUG: Docetaxel,Cisplatin,Fluorouracil|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)|DRUG: Cisplatin","Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is to first disease progression \[local recurrence and/or distant metastasis\] or death from any cause., 3 years","Overall Survival, Overall survival is from randomization to death of any cause or last follow-up., 3 years|Locoregional Failure-free Survival, Locoregional failure-free survival is from randomization to locoregional progression., 3 years|Distant Failure-free Survival, Distant failure-free survival is from randomization to first distant metastasis., 3 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Incidence of acute and late toxicity, 3 years",,Wei Jiang,Wuzhou Red Cross Hospital|Guangxi Naxishan Hospital|LiuZhou People's Hospital|Guigang People's Hospital|Youjiang Medical College for Nationalities|Nanning Monority Hospital,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,440,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,GLMU-01,2015-03,2021-05,2021-12,2015-05-05,,2018-05-16,"Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Baise, Guangxi, China|Guigang People's Hospital, Guigang, Guangxi, China|Guangxi Naxishan Hospital, Guilin, Guangxi, China|Liuzhou People's Hospital, Liuzhou, Guangxi, China|Nanning Monority Hospital, Nanning, Guangxi, China|Wuzhou Red Cross Hospital, Wuzhou, Guangxi, China",
