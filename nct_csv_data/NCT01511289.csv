NCT01511289,Radotinib Versus Imatinib in Newly Diagnosed Philadelphia Chromosome and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Chronic Phase Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01511289,,COMPLETED,"In this study, the efficacy and safety of two radotinib doses, 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, will be compared with imatinib 400 mg once daily in newly diagnosed patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP).",NO,"Leukemia|Leukemia, Myeloid|Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive|Philadelphia Chromosome|Bone Marrow Diseases|Hematologic Diseases",DRUG: Imatinib|DRUG: Radotinib,"Rate of Major Molecular Response(MMR) by 12 months, Rate of Major Molecular Response (MMR) at Any Time within 12 months. MMR by 12 months will be assessed as responder if the patient has response at any time within 12 months.

A major molecular response rate is defined as the ratio (%) of BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.1% by international scale or a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcript level from standardized baseline, as measured by standardized RQ-PCR assay., 12 months","Rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 12 months, Complete cytogenetic response is defined as complete disappearance of Philadelphia-positive in at least 20 metaphases examined. Chromosome analysis performed on less than 20 metaphases will not be accepted for this study, 12 months|Rate of complete molecular response (CMR) by 12 months, Complete molecular response is defined as negative BCR-ABL transcript levels, as measured twice by the internationally standardized RQ-PCR assay.

The rate of complete molecular response by cycle 12 is defined as an at least 4.5 log reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels from standardized baseline or BCR-ABL/ABL % ≤ 0.005% by the international scale., 12 months|Rate of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months, Rate of Major Molecular response will be assessed at 12 months at that timepoint.
