The questionnaire includes 28 items with 4-point Likert type responses from ""1-not at all"" to ""4-very much"" to assess functioning and symptoms; 2 items with 7-point Likert scales (1= poor and 7= excellent) for global health and overall QoL. Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing better GHS, better functioning, and more symptoms. Negative change from baseline values indicate deterioration in quality of life or functioning and positive values indicate improvement., Baseline, Months 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18|Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state., Baseline, Months 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18|Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 Dimensions-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score, EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system provides a profile of the participant's health state 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The participant was asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. Responses to the 5 dimension scores were combined and converted into a single preference-weighted health utility index score 0 (0.0- worst health state) to 1 (1.0- better health state) representing the general health status of the individual based on the UK scoring algorithm., Baseline, Months 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18",,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,706,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CR104761|54767414MMY3007|2014-002272-88,2014-12-09,2017-11-21,2024-08-07,2014-07-21,2018-12-17,2025-04-01,"California City, California, United States|Corona, California, United States|Fountain Valley, California, United States|Los Angeles, California, United States|Hialeah, Florida, United States|Orange Park, Florida, United States|Chicago, Illinois, United States|Springfield, Missouri, United States|Cleveland, Ohio, United States|Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States|Buenos Aires, Argentina|Ciudad Autonoma Buenos Aires, Argentina|Córdoba, Argentina|Santa Fe, Argentina|Adelaide, Australia|Bendigo, Australia|Camperdown N/a, Australia|Geelong, Australia|Gosford, Australia|Greenslopes, Australia|Hobart, Australia|North Adelaide, Australia|Parkville, Australia|Antwerpen, Belgium|Antwerp, Belgium|Brussel, Belgium|Charleroi, Belgium|Gent, Belgium|Kortrijk, Belgium|Roeselare, Belgium|Turnhout, Belgium|Yvoir, Belgium|Barretos, Brazil|Cuiaba - Mount, Brazil|Fortaleza, Brazil|Goiania, Brazil|Natal, Brazil|Porto Alegre, Brazil|Ribeirao Preto, Brazil|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Sao Paulo, Brazil|Pleven, Bulgaria|Plovdiv, Bulgaria|Sofia, Bulgaria|Varna, Bulgaria|Vratsa, Bulgaria|Zadar, Croatia|Zagreb, Croatia|Brno, Czechia|Hradec Kralove, Czechia|Olomouc, Czechia|Ostrava-Poruba, Czechia|Praha 10, Czechia|Praha 2, Czechia|Tbilisi, Georgia|Berlin, Germany|Dortmund, Germany|Karlsruhe, Germany|Potsdam, Germany|Saarbrücken, Germany|Stuttgart, Germany|Würzburg, Germany|Athens Attica, Greece|Athens, Greece|Patra, Greece|Thessaloniki, Greece|Budapest, Hungary|Debrecen, Hungary|Kaposvar, Hungary|Pecs N/a, Hungary|Chiba, Japan|Hitachi, Japan|Kanazawa, Japan|Kawasaki, Japan|Kobe, Japan|Kurume, Japan|Matsuyama, Japan|Nagoya, Japan|Narita, Japan|Ohgaki, Japan|Okayama, Japan|Osaka, Japan|Sendai-shi, Japan|Shibukawa, Japan|Shibuya, Japan|Tachikawa, Japan|Toyohashi, Japan|Busan, Korea, Republic of|Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of|Hwasun, Korea, Republic of|Incheon, Korea, Republic of|Seongnam, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, Korea, Republic of|Skopje, North Macedonia|Bialystok, Poland|Bydgoszcz, Poland|Chorzow, Poland|Gdansk, Poland|Legnica, Poland|Lublin, Poland|Opole, Poland|Slupsk, Poland|Warszawa Ul, Poland|Warszawa, Poland|Wroclaw, Poland|Lisboa, Portugal|Lisbon, Portugal|Porto, Portugal|Brasov, Romania|Bucharest, Romania|Iasi, Romania|Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation|Dzerzhinsk, Russian Federation|Ekaterinbourg, Russian Federation|Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation|Ryazan, Russian Federation|Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation|Saratov, Russian Federation|Sochi, Russian Federation|St Petersburg, Russian Federation|Volgograd, Russian Federation|Belgrade, Serbia|Nis, Serbia|Novi Sad, Serbia|Sremska Kamenica, Serbia|Zemun, Serbia|Andalucía, Spain|Badalona, Spain|Barcelona, Spain|Córdoba, Spain|Girona, Spain|La Laguna, Spain|Madrid, Spain|Maranon, Spain|Murcia N/a, Spain|Ourense, Spain|Pamplona, Spain|Salamanca, Spain|Sevilla, Spain|Toledo, Spain|Valencia, Spain|Zaragoza, Spain|Altindag, Turkey|Ankara, Turkey|Aydin, Turkey|Izmir, Turkey|Kayseri, Turkey|Samsun, Turkey|Tekirdag, Turkey|Cherkassy, Ukraine|Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine|Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine|Kharkov, Ukraine|Khmelnitskiy, Ukraine|Lviv, Ukraine|Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine|Birmingham, United Kingdom|Cambridge, United Kingdom|Colchester, United Kingdom|Harlow, United Kingdom|Leicester, United Kingdom|London, United Kingdom|Manchester, United Kingdom|Woolwich, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/79/NCT02195479/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/79/NCT02195479/SAP_001.pdf"
