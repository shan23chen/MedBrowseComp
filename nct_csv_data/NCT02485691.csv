NCT02485691,Cabazitaxel Versus the Switch to Alternative AR-targeted Agent (Enzalutamide or Abiraterone) in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients Previously Treated With Docetaxel and Who Rapidly Failed a Prior AR-targeted Agent,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02485691,CARD,COMPLETED,"Primary Objective:

To compare the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) (using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1 for tumor lesions and Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria for bone scan lesions or death due to any cause) with chemotherapy (cabazitaxel plus prednisone, Arm A) versus Androgen Receptor (AR)-targeted therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, Arm B) in mCRPC participants who have been treated with docetaxel and who had disease progression while receiving AR-targeted therapy within 12 months of AR treatment initiation (less than or equal to \[\<=\]12 months, either before or after docetaxel).

Secondary Objective:

* To compare efficacy for:
* Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and time to PSA progression (TTPP).
* Progression-free survival (PFS).
* Overall survival (OS).
* Tumor response rate and duration of tumor response.
* Pain response and time to pain progression.
* Symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) rate and time to occurrence of any SSE.
* Health status and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL).
* To evaluate the correlation of a signature of resistance to AR-targeted agents with clinical outcome via the analysis of circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotypes as well as expression and localization of proteins including AR isoforms in CTCs.
* To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms.",YES,Prostate Cancer Metastatic,DRUG: cabazitaxel XRP6258|DRUG: enzalutamide|DRUG: abiraterone acetate|DRUG: prednisone,"Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), Radiographic progression-free survival: time (in months) from randomization to occurrence of any one of following: radiological tumor progressions using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1), progression of bone lesions using Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria or occurrence of death due to any cause.

As per RECIST 1.1 CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

FACT-P was a 39-item participant rated questionnaire that measures the concerns of participants with prostate cancer. It consisted of 5 sub-scales assessing physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), functional well-being (7 items), and prostate-specific concerns (12 items). FACT-P total score was the sum of all 5 subscale scores. It ranged from 0 to156 with higher score indicated better quality of life with fewer symptoms. Baseline corresponded to last evaluable assessment before treatment administration., Baseline, Day 1 of each Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, Cycle 8 and at End of Treatment (any time up to 141 weeks)|Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Working Group Health Status Measure 5 Dimensions, 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Single Index and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Scores at Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and End of Treatment, EQ-5D was a standardized HRQOL questionnaire consisting of EQ-5D descriptive system and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression measured on 3 levels (no problem, some problems \& severe problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. 5 dimensional 3-level system was converted into single index utility score. Possible values for single index utility score ranged from -0.594 (severe problems in all dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in all dimensions) on scale where 1 represented best possible health state. EQ-5D VAS was used to record a participant's rating for his/her current health-related quality of life state and captured on a vertical VAS scale ranging from 0-100, where 0=worst imaginable health state and 100=best imaginable health state, where higher states indicated better outcomes. Baseline corresponded to last evaluable assessment before treatment administration., Baseline, Day 1 of each Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, Cycle 8 and at End of Treatment (any time up to: 141 weeks)|Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) in Participants With Presence and Absence of Biomarker, Circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts were considered as biomarker in a liquid biopsy. rPFS in participants with presence and absence of subtypes of CTC biomarker i.e. chromosomal instability (CIN) and neuroendocrine (NE) was reported in this outcome measure. rPFS was defined as: time (in months) from randomization to the first occurrence of any one of following: radiological tumor progressions (RECIST1.1), progression of bone lesions (PCWG2 criteria) or death due to any cause.
