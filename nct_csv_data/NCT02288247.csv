NCT02288247,A Study to Assess the Benefit of Treatment Beyond Progression With Enzalutamide in Men Who Are Starting Treatment With Docetaxel After Worsening of Their Prostate Cancer When Taking Enzalutamide Alone,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02288247,PRESIDE,COMPLETED,"The purpose of the study was to understand if there was benefit in continued treatment with a medicine called enzalutamide, when starting treatment with docetaxel and prednisolone (a standard chemotherapy for prostate cancer), after the prostate cancer had gotten worse when treated with enzalutamide alone.",YES,Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer,DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS: time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to earliest progression event. Progression is defined as radiographic progression, unequivocal clinical progression, or death on study. Radiographic progression is defined for bone disease by appearance of ≥ 2 new lesions on whole-body radionuclide bone scan per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria (i.e., unconfirmed progressive disease) that needs to be confirmed in the next assessment (i.e., progressive disease in the next assessment) or for soft tissue disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Unequivocal clinical progression is defined as new onset cancer pain requiring chronic administration of opiate analgesia or deterioration from prostate cancer of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score to ≥ 3, or initiation of subsequent lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy or surgical intervention due to complications of tumor progression., From date of randomization to the earliest of either documented disease progression (median duration: 35 weeks)","Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression, defined as the time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to the date of the first PSA value in Period 2 demonstrating progression (Period 2). The PSA progression date is defined as the date that a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir recorded in Period 2 is documented, which must be confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained at least 3 weeks later., From date of randomization to the first PSA value (median duration: 35 weeks)|Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Response, PSA response, defined as a decrease in percentage change from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) of 50% or more. PSA response was derived at Week 13 and at any time after randomization in Period 2. PSA response at any time is defined as a decrease in percentage change from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) at any time after randomization of 50% or more. Percentage of participants with PSA response was reported., Randomization, Week 13, any time after randomization in Period 2 (median of 35 weeks)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the best overall radiographic response after randomization (Period 2 Week 1) as per Investigator assessments of response for soft tissue disease per RECIST 1.1, in participants who had a measurable tumor. ORR was reported as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR was defined as disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm from baseline measurement. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) of target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of diameters., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Time to Pain Progression, The time to an increase of \>=30% from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) in average BPI-SF item scores (items 3, 4, 5, 6) at two consecutive evaluations \>=3 weeks apart without decrease in analgesic score according to the World health Organization (WHO). Only participants with an average pain intensity item score \>=4 were considered. The BPI-SF was an instrument to document pain-related functional impairment and contains 7 questions which included pain intensity \[(items 3, 4, 5 and 6): worst pain, least pain, average pain and current pain, with scales from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine)\] and pain interference \](items 9A to 9G): general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life, with scales from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes)\]. The BPI-SF total score for pain intensity was calculated as the mean of the 4 scores for the 4 items of pain intensity., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Time to Opiate Use for Cancer-related Pain, Time to opiate use for cancer-related pain, defined as the time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to initiation of chronic administration of opiate analgesia \[parenteral opiate use for ≥7 days or use of WHO Analgesic Ladder Level 3 oral opiates for ≥3 weeks\]., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Time to First Skeletal-related Event (SRE), Time to first SRE, defined as the time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), FACT-P quality of life questionnaire is a multi-dimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument specifically designed for use with prostate cancer participants. It consists of 27 core items which assess participant function in four domains rated on 0 to 4 Likert-type scale: physical well-being (PWB) (7 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-28), social/family well-being (SWB) (7 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-28), emotional well-being (EWB) (6 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-24), and functional well-being (FWB) (7 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-28), which is further supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms (Prostate Cancer Subscale \[PCS\] 12 items rated on Likert-type scale 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-48). The total domain scores and PCS subscale score are then combined to a global quality of life score ranging between 0 to 156; higher scores representing better quality of life., Period 2: Baseline, weeks 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97, 109, 121, 133, 145, 157, 169, 181|Change From Baseline in EuroQOL 5-dimension 5-level Questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable)., Period 2: Baseline, weeks 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97, 109, 121, 133, 145, 157, 169, 181",,Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.,"Medivation LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc.",MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,688,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",9785-MA-1001|2013-004711-50,2014-12-01,2020-04-30,2024-03-15,2014-11-11,2021-12-15,2025-04-08,"Site AT43004, Linz, 4010, Austria|Site AT43001, Vienna, 1090, Austria|Site BE32003, Bonheiden, 2820, Belgium|Site BE32002, Liege, 4000, Belgium|Site BE32004, Ottignies, 1340, Belgium|Site CZ42004, Brno, 656 91, Czechia|Site CZ42003, Olomouc, 77520, Czechia|Site CZ42002, Plzeň -Lochotín, 30460, Czechia|Site CZ42001, Praha 2, 12808, Czechia|Site FR33012, Albi, 81000, France|Site FR33003, Montpellier, 34298 cedex 5, France|Site FR33002, Nîmes, 30907 cedex 2, France|Site FR33008, Paris, 75014, France|Site FR33014, Paris, 75014, France|Site FR33004, Plerin, 22190, France|Site FR33013, Quimper, 29000, France|Site FR33011, Reims, 51056, France|Site FR33005, Suresnes, 92151, France|Site DE49018, Nürtingen, Baden-Württemberg, 72622, Germany|Site DE49008, Aachen, 52074, Germany|Site DE49010, Bergisch Gladbach, 51465, Germany|Site DE49001, Hannover, 30625, Germany|Site DE49006, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany|Site DE49003, Mannheim, 68167, Germany|Site DE49002, Munster, 48149, Germany|Site DE49015, Tübingen, 72076, Germany|Site DE49017, Ulm, 89075, Germany|Site DE49004, Wuppertal, 42103, Germany|Site GR30001, Heraklion, Crete, 70013, Greece|Site GR30004, Heraklion, Crete, 71403, Greece|Site GR30003, Athens, 14564, Greece|Site GR30006, Athens, 155 62, Greece|Site GR30005, Thessaloniki, 54007, Greece|Site IT39001, Arezzo, 52100, Italy|Site IT39012, Brescia, 25126, Italy|Site IT39003, Milano, 20100, Italy|Site IT39008, Naples, 80131, Italy|Site IT39010, Pavia, 27100, Italy|Site IT39005, Roma, 00128, Italy|Site IT39004, Rome, 161, Italy|Site IT39002, Terni, 05100, Italy|Site NL31002, Amsterdam, 1066 CX, Netherlands|Site NL31007, Blaricum, 1261 AN, Netherlands|Site NL31004, Hoofddorp, 2134 TM, Netherlands|Site NL31010, Nieuwegein, 3435 CM, Netherlands|Site NL31003, Rotterdam, 3045 PM, Netherlands|Site NO47005, Drammen, 3004, Norway|Site NO47001, Kristiansand, 4615, Norway|Site NO47004, Stavanger, 4011, Norway|Site PL48004, Gdańsk, 80-952, Poland|Site PL48003, Krakow, 31-501, Poland|Site PL48002, Lodz, 93-513, Poland|Site PL48006, Warszawa, 02-507, Poland|Site PL48005, Warszawa, 04-141, Poland|Site RU70004, Obninsk, Kaluga, 24903, Russian Federation|Site RU70002, Moscow, 105077, Russian Federation|Site RU70001, Moscow, 115478, Russian Federation|Site RU70003, Moscow, 125284, Russian Federation|Site RU70005, St. Petersburg, 197022, Russian Federation|Site RU70006, St. Petersburg, 197758, Russian Federation|Site ES34005, Lugo, 27003, Spain|Site ES34003, Madrid, 28007, Spain|Site ES34001, Madrid, 28040, Spain|Site ES34002, Madrid, 28041, Spain|Site ES34010, Madrid, Spain|Site ES34007, Malaga, 29010, Spain|Site ES34009, Murcia, 30008, Spain|Site ES34008, Santander, 39008, Spain|Site ES34004, Sevilla, 41013, Spain|Site ES34006, Valencia, 46009, Spain|Site SE46002, Göteborg, 413 45, Sweden|Site SE46005, Kalmar, 39185, Sweden|Site SE46003, Solna, 171 76, Sweden|Site SE46004, Uppsala, 751 85, Sweden|Site CH41005, Locarno, Tessin, 6600, Switzerland|Site CH41009, Zurich, CH-8038, Switzerland|Site TR90001, Ankara, 06500, Turkey|Site TR90003, Istanbul, 34722, Turkey|Site TR90002, Izmir, 35340, Turkey|Site GB44010, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZN, United Kingdom|Site GB44004, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, United Kingdom|Site GB44018, Cardiff, CF4 7XL, United Kingdom|Site GB44014, Exeter, United Kingdom|Site GB44003, London, SE1 9RT, United Kingdom|Site GB44020, Northwood, HA62RN, United Kingdom|Site GB44015, Norwich, NR4 7UY, United Kingdom|Site GB44002, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom|Site GB44017, Swansea, SA2 8QA, United Kingdom|Site GB44007, Wirral, CH63 4JY, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/47/NCT02288247/Prot_002.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/47/NCT02288247/SAP_003.pdf"
