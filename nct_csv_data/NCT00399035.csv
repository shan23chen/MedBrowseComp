NCT00399035,"Cediranib (AZD2171, RECENTIN™) in Addition to Chemotherapy in Patients With Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00399035,HORIZON II,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to determine if Cediranib when added to chemotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy alone in prolonging life expectancy and slowing disease progression in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.,YES,Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"DRUG: Cediranib|DRUG: FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin)|DRUG: XELOX (Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin)|DRUG: Cediranib Placebo","Progression-free Survival, RECIST criteria defined as follows: Target lesions Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded (either at baseline or at previous assessment since treatment began).Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Non-target lesions Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all non-target lesions Non-Complete Response (non-CR/Non- Progression \[non-PD\]) Persistence of one or more non-target lesion or/and maintenance of tumour marker level above the normal limits. Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions., RECIST assessed at baseline every 6 weeks through to week 24 and 12 week thereafter through to progression or data cut off date of 21/03/10 whichever was earliest.|Overall Survival, Number of months from randomisation to the date of death from any cause, Baseline through to date of death upto and including data cut off date of 21/03/10","Overall Response Rate, Objective tumour response(defined as a confirmed response of CR or PR).The definition for a confirmed response was met when an initial RECIST response of PR/CR was confirmed at the next scheduled visit as a PR/CR according to an evaluable assessment.Intervening assessments of non-evaluable or stable disease were allowable as long as the initial RECIST response was confirmed.RECIST criteria defined as follows: Target lesions Complete Response(CR)Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR).At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
