NCT01042379,I-SPY TRIAL: Neoadjuvant and Personalized Adaptive Novel Agents to Treat Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01042379,I-SPY,RECRUITING,The purpose of this study is to further advance the ability to practice personalized medicine by learning which new drug agents are most effective with which types of breast cancer tumors and by learning more about which early indicators of response (tumor analysis prior to surgery via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images along with tissue and blood samples) are predictors of treatment success.,NO,Breast Neoplasms|Breast Cancer|Breast Tumors|Angiosarcoma|TNBC -
