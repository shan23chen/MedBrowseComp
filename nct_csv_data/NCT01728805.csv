NCT01728805,Study of KW-0761 Versus Vorinostat in Relapsed/Refractory CTCL,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01728805,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to compare the progression free survival of KW-0761 versus vorinostat for subjects with relapsed or refractory CTCL.,YES,Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: KW-0761|DRUG: Vorinostat,"Progression Free Survival, Progression was defined as follows, based on Olsen (2011):

* Lymph nodes: ≥ 50% increase in SPD from baseline of lymph nodes, any new node \> 1.5 cm in the long axis or \> 1 cm in the short axis if 1-1.5 cm in the long axis that is proven to be N3 histologically, or \> 50% increase from nadir in SPD of lymph nodes in those with PR
* Skin: ≥ 25% increase in skin disease from baseline, new tumors (T3) in patients with T1, T2 or T4 only skin disease, or in those with CR or PR, increase of skin score of greater than the sum of nadir plus 50% baseline score
* Blood: B0 to B2, \> 50% increase from baseline and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL36, or \> 50% increase from nadir and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL
* Viscera: \> 50% increase in size (SPD) of any organs involved at baseline, new organ involvement, or \> 50% increase from nadir in the size (SPD) of any previous organ involvement in those with PR, From date of randomization at every visit until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months","Overall Response Rate, The ORR was defined as the count of subjects who had a confirmed CR or PR, defined as documented CR or PR per Global Composite Response Score that was confirmed by a subsequent observation at least 4 weeks later. Overall Response Rate was determined based on the response in all compartments (lymph nodes, skin, peripheral blood, and viscera), referencing Olsen, 2011 as follows: Complete Response (CR) = complete disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease; Partial Response (PR) = regression of measurable disease; Stable Disease (SD) = failure to attain CR, PR, or PD; Progressive Disease (PD) = PD in any compartment; Relapse = recurrence of disease in prior CR in any compartment., at the end of cycle 1 (26-28 days), and then every other cycle in Year 1 (cycle 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13), and every 16 weeks (cycle 17, 21, etc.) in Year 2 and beyond until progression up to 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment - Skindex-29 Symptoms Scale Score, * Skindex-29 rates 29 items assessing 3 domains (emotions, symptoms, \& functioning) on a linear scale from 0 (never) to all the time (100). Higher scores = higher impact of skin disease.
* FACT-G rates 27 items in 4 domains (physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being) on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores = better QoL.
* EuroQoL lvl 3 (Eq-5D-3L) rates mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression on 3 levels - no problems, some problems, extreme problems. Score is calculated using a set of item weights to derive a single score ranging from -0.109 to 1, with 1 representing full health.

LS mean (and 95% CI) of the overall change from baseline across time points through 6-month assessment (including End of Cycles 1, 3, and 5 time points only) are calculated from MMRM with treatment, disease type, disease stage, and region as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate., Cycle 1, 3, and 5|Pruritis Evaluation, The Itchy QoL is a validated pruritus specific quality of life instrument. It includes 22 pruritus-specific questions covering three major domains: symptoms, functioning, and emotions. The scale ranges from Never (1) to All The Time (5). The subscale scores consist of the average of the responses to the items in a given subscale. The overall score is the average of the responses to all items. Higher Itchy QoL scores indicate worse quality of life.

LS mean (and 95% CI) of the overall change from baseline across time points through 6-month assessment (including End of Cycles 1, 3, and 5 time points only) are calculated from MMRM with treatment, disease type, disease stage, and region as fixed effects and baseline score as a covariate., Cycle 1, 3, and 5",,"Kyowa Kirin, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,372,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,0761-010,2012-11,2017-03,2021-02-17,2012-11-20,2019-04-11,2024-04-25,"University of Alabama - Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Banner MD Anderson, Gilbert, Arizona, 85234, United States|City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, 91010, United States|UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Stanford Medical Center, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Yale University School of Medicine - Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, United States|H.
