NCT00379041,Radiation Therapy With or Without Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I or Stage II Hodgkin's Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00379041,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with or without combination chemotherapy in treating patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works with or without combination chemotherapy in treating patients with previously untreated stage I or stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma.",NO,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: bleomycin sulfate|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: mechlorethamine hydrochloride|DRUG: prednisone|DRUG: procarbazine hydrochloride|DRUG: vinblastine sulfate|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|RADIATION: radiation therapy,Overall survival|Reduction of late treatment-related toxicity|Maintenance of failure-free survival rate,,,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1158,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EORTC-20931|EORTC-20931-LYMG,1993-09-01,1998-10-01,,2006-09-21,,2024-02-22,,
