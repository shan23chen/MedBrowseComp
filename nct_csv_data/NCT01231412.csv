NCT01231412,Graft-Versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis in Treating Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing Unrelated Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01231412,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial studies how well graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving total-body irradiation (TBI) together with fludarabine phosphate (FLU), cyclosporine (CSP), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or sirolimus before transplant may stop this from happening.",YES,"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm|Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Myeloproliferative Neoplasm|Prolymphocytic Leukemia|Recurrent Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Recurrent Plasma Cell Myeloma|Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Refractory Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, BCR-ABL1 Positive|Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|T-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia",PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Cyclosporine|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|DRUG: Mycophenolate Mofetil|PROCEDURE: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Sirolimus|RADIATION: Total-Body Irradiation,"Number of Patients With Grades II-IV Acute GVHD, Number of patients with grades II-IV acute GVHD

aGVHD Stages

Skin:

1. a maculopapular eruption involving \< 25% BSA
2. a maculopapular eruption involving 25 - 50% BSA
3. generalized erythroderma
4. generalized erythroderma w/ bullous formation and often w/ desquamation

Liver:

1. bilirubin 2.0 - 3.0 mg/100 mL
2. bilirubin 3 - 5.9 mg/100 mL
3. bilirubin 6 - 14.9 mg/100 mL
4. bilirubin \> 15 mg/100 mL

Gut:

Diarrhea is graded 1 - 4 in severity. Nausea and vomiting and/or anorexia caused by GVHD is assigned as 1 in severity. The severity of gut involvement is assigned to the most severe involvement noted. Patients w/ visible bloody diarrhea are at least stage 2 gut and grade 3 overall.

aGVHD Grades Grade II: Stage 1 - 2 skin w/ no gut/liver involvement Grade III: Stage 2 - 4 gut involvement and/or stage 2 - 4 liver involvement Grade IV: Pattern and severity of GVHD similar to grade 3 w/ extreme constitutional symptoms or death, At day 100 post-transplant","Number of Patients With Chronic Extensive GVHD, Number of patients who developed chronic extensive GVHD post-transplant. The diagnosis of chronic GVHD requires at least one manifestation that is distinctive for chronic GVHD as opposed to acute GVHD. In all cases, infection and others causes must be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD., Up to 1 year|Number of Patients With Grades III-IV Acute GVHD, Number of patients with grades III-IV acute GVHD
