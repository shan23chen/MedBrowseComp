NCT02352948,"A Global Study to Assess the Effects of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab), Given as Monotherapy or in Combination With Tremelimumab Determined by PD-L1 Expression Versus Standard of Care in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02352948,ARCTIC,COMPLETED,"This study is a Phase III, randomised, open label, multi-centre study assessing the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) versus Standard of Care in NSCLC patients with PD-L1 positive tumours and the combination of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) plus tremelimumab (MEDI4736+treme) versus Standard of Care in NSCLC patients with PD-L1-negative tumours in the treatment of male and female patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB-IV), who have received at least 2 prior systemic treatment regimens including 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC. Patients with known EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase (TK) activating mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements are not eligible for the study (prospective testing is not planned within this study). The Standard of Care options are: an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib \[TARCEVA®\]), gemcitabine or vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®)",YES,Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer NSCLC,DRUG: MEDI4736 (durvalumab)|DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4)|DRUG: tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4),"Overall Survival (OS), The OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., From randomization (Day 1) until death due to any cause, approximately 36 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. The PFS was determined by Investigator assessments according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or progression of non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, Tumour scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 3 years.","OS, Contribution of the Components Analysis of Sub-study B, The OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., From randomization (Day 1) until death due to any cause, approximately 36 months|Percentage of Participants Alive at 12 Months (OS12), The OS12 was defined as the percentage of participants who were alive at 12 months after randomisation per Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 12 months., From randomization (Day 1) up to 12 months|PFS, Contribution of the Components Analysis of Sub-study B, The PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. The PFS was determined by Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or progression of non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, Tumour scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 3 years.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with at least 1 visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) among ITT participants who had measurable disease at baseline. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions (any pathological lymph nodes selected as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm) and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters as long as criteria for PD are not met). The ORR was measured using Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1., Tumour scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 3 years.|Duration of Response (DoR), The DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. The DoR was determined by Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or progression of non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, Tumour scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 3 years.|Percentage of Participants Alive and Progression Free at 6 Months (APF6), The APF6 was defined as the percentage of participants who were alive and progression free per RECIST v1.1 at 6 months after randomization per Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS at 6 months. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or progression of non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, Tumour scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 6 months|Percentage of Participants Alive and Progression Free at 12 Months (APF12), The APF12 was defined as the percentage of participants who were alive and progression free per RECIST v1.1 at 12 months after randomization per Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS at 12 months. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or progression of non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, Tumour scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 12 months.|Time From Randomisation to Second Progression (PFS2) of Sub-study B, The PFS2 was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest of the progression event subsequent to that used for the PFS endpoint or death and determined by local standard clinical practice and have included any of the following: objective radiological, symptomatic progression, or death. PFS2 was reported for sub-study B only., Tumour scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until first progression. Disease then assessed per local practice until 2nd progression.
