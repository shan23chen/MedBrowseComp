NCT00002874,Radiation Therapy With or Without Bicalutamide for Recurrent pT3N0 Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00002874,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using bicalutamide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It is not yet known if radiation therapy is more effective with or without bicalutamide for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without bicalutamide in treating patients who have stage II or stage III prostate cancer and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels following radical prostatectomy.",YES,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: bicalutamide|RADIATION: radiation therapy|DRUG: placebo,"Overall Survival (12-year Rates Reported), Overall survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with failure defined as death by any cause. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, twelve-year rates are reported. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, but twelve-year rates were reported.

Patients are followed until death., From date of randomization to 12 years.","Non-Prostate Cancer Death (12-year Rates Reported), Non-prostate cancer death rates were estimated by the cumulative incidence method, with failure defined as any death that does not fall into the following categories: death due to prostate cancer or complications of protocol treatment (centrally reviewed), death with known progressive metastatic disease while on salvage hormone therapy, or death with a known rising PSA while on salvage hormone therapy. All other deaths are considered competing risks. Patients alive at time of analysis were censored. Any other death was treated as a competing risk. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, but twelve-year rates were reported.

Patients are followed until death. ""Non-Prostate cancer death"" is a more accurate wording for the protocol endpoint of ""non-disease-specific survival"", and matches the protocol definition., From date of randomization to 12 years.|Second PSA Recurrence (12-year Rates Reported), Second PSA recurrence (SPSAR) rates (i.e. first PSA failure on study) were estimated by the cumulative incidence method, with failure defined as the first occurrence of one of the following events: 1. Increase in PSA following protocol treatment according to the following criteria met during protocol treatment: If PSA dropped to undetectable level (\<0.2 ng/ml) during protocol treatment (PT) then failure = increase after PT to \>= 0.5 ng/ml ; If PSA decreased to a detectable level (â‰¥ 0.2 ng/ml) during PT, then failure = increase PT of \>= 0.3 ng/ml above the lowest detectable level; If PSA did not decrease during PT then failure = increase in PSA after PT of \>= 0.5 ng/ml above entry PSA level. 2. The start of salvage hormone therapy. Patients alive without SPSAR at time of analysis were censored. Death without SPSAR was treated as a competing risk. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, but twelve-year rates were reported. Patients are followed until death., From date of randomization to 12 years.|Third PSA Recurrence (12-year Rates Reported), Third PSA recurrence rates (i.e. second PSA failure on study) were estimated by the cumulative incidence method, with failure defined as PSA value of 0.5ng/ml or higher or any disease progression after starting salvage hormone therapy. Patients alive without third PSA recurrence at time of analysis were censored. Death without third PSA recurrence was treated as a competing risk. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, but twelve-year rates were reported. Patients are followed until death., From start of salvage hormone therapy to 12 years.|PSA Complete Response at End of Protocol Treatment, Complete response is defined as a drop in PSA on protocol treatment to less than 0.2 ng/ml. Note that when the study opened many institutions could not detect PSA \< 05 ng/ml., End of protocol treatment, which is planned to last for two years|Distant Failure (12-year Rates Reported), Distant failure rates were estimated by the cumulative incidence method, with failure defined as the first occurrence of distant failure. Patients alive without distant metastases at time of analysis were censored. Death without distant metastasis was treated as a competing risk. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, but twelve-year rates were reported. Patients are followed until death., From date of randomization to 12 years.|Prostate Cancer Death (12-year Rates Reported), Prostate cancer death rates were estimated by the cumulative incidence method, with failure defined as death due to prostate cancer or complications of protocol treatment (centrally reviewed), death with known progressive metastatic disease while on salvage hormone therapy, or death with a known rising PSA while on salvage hormone therapy. Patients alive at time of analysis were censored. Any other death was treated as a competing risk. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, but twelve-year rates were reported. Patients are followed until death. ""Prostate cancer death"" is a more accurate wording for the protocol endpoint of ""disease-specific survival"", and matches the protocol definition., From date of randomization to 12 years.|Progression-free Survival (12-year Rates Reported), Progress-free survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with failure defined as the first occurrence of PSA failure, local, regional or distant failure, or death from any cause. Patients alive without progression at time of analysis were censored. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients, but twelve-year rates were reported. Patients are followed until death. ""Progression-free Survival"" is more accurate wording for the protocol endpoint of ""Freedom from Progression"", and matches the protocol definition., From date of randomization to 12 years.|Grade 3+ Toxicity, Adverse events are graded using the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Radiation Morbidity Scoring. Grade refers to severity, assigning Grades 1 through 5 based on this general guideline: Grade 0 None, Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related toxicity. Toxicities reported to have occurred within 90 days from the start of radiotherapy are reported as ""Acute Radiotherapy"", all later toxicities are reported as ""Hormone therapy and late radiotherapy toxicity"". The highest grade toxicity event per subject is counted within each of these time periods. Four-year follow-up was required of all patients; patients are followed until death., From date of randomization to four years.",,Radiation Therapy Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|SWOG Cancer Research Network|NRG Oncology,MALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,840,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",RTOG-9601|CDR0000065158|RTOG-R9601,1998-02,2015-08,2022-05-20,2003-01-27,2017-08-18,2022-06-15,"University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294-3300, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Institute of Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, 35801, United States|Huntsville Hospital System, Huntsville, Alabama, 35807, United States|MBCCOP - Gulf Coast, Mobile, Alabama, 36688, United States|Alabama Oncology, LLC, Montgomery, Alabama, 36106-3657, United States|Radiation Oncology Associates of West Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 35401, United States|Foundation for Cancer Research and Education, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|Mount Diablo Medical Center, Concord, California, 94524-4110, United States|City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, 91010-3000, United States|Saint Agnes Cancer Center, Fresno, California, 93720, United States|California Cancer Center, Fresno, California, 93729-5100, United States|Sutter Health West Cancer Research Group, Greenbrae, California, 94904, United States|Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, 92354, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Long Beach, Long Beach, California, 90822, United States|Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, 90025-1781, United States|USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital, Los Angeles, California, 90033-0804, United States|CCOP - Bay Area Tumor Institute, Oakland, California, 94609-3305, United States|Huntington Cancer Center, Pasadena, California, 91105, United States|Cancer Care Center, Pomona, California, 91767, United States|Radiation Oncology Center - Sacramento, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|Radiation Medical Group, Inc., San Diego, California, 92101, United States|UCSF Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute, San Francisco, California, 94143-0128, United States|O'Connor Hospital, San Jose, California, 95128, United States|CCOP - Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, California, 94535, United States|Memorial Hospital Cancer Center, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80909, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver, Colorado, 80010, United States|Saint Mary's Hospital and Medical Center, Grand Junction, Colorado, 81502-1628, United States|Hospital of St. Raphael, New Haven, Connecticut, 06511, United States|CCOP - Christiana Care Health Services, Wilmington, Delaware, 19899, United States|University of Florida Health Science Center, Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0385, United States|Florida Radiation Oncology Group, Jacksonville, Florida, 32207, United States|Health First Holmes Regional Medical Center, Melbourne, Florida, 32901-3276, United States|CCOP - Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, 33140, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Miami, Miami, Florida, 33125, United States|Sylvester Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Baptist Hospital of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33256-2110, United States|MD Anderson Cancer Center Orlando, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Bay Medical Center, Panama City, Florida, 32401, United States|Gulf Coast Cancer Treatment Center, Panama City, Florida, 32405-4587, United States|Sarasota Radiation and Medical Oncology Center, Sarasota, Florida, 34233, United States|Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare, Tallahassee, Florida, 32308, United States|H.
