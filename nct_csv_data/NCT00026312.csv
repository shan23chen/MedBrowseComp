NCT00026312,"Isotretinoin With or Without Dinutuximab, Aldesleukin, and Sargramostim Following Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Neuroblastoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00026312,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This partially randomized phase III trial studies isotretinoin with dinutuximab, aldesleukin, and sargramostim to see how well it works compared to isotretinoin alone following stem cell transplant in treating patients with neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as isotretinoin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Aldesleukin and sargramostim may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without dinutuximab, aldesleukin, and sargramostim following stem cell transplant in treating neuroblastoma.",YES,Localized Resectable Neuroblastoma|Localized Unresectable Neuroblastoma|Recurrent Neuroblastoma|Regional Neuroblastoma|Stage 4 Neuroblastoma|Stage 4S Neuroblastoma,BIOLOGICAL: Aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: Dinutuximab|DRUG: Isotretinoin|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Pharmacological Study|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|BIOLOGICAL: Sargramostim,"Event-Free Survival (EFS), Comparison to determine if RA + Immunotherapy improves EFS as compared to RA Only, Three years","Event-Free Survival (EFS), Comparison to determine if RA + Immunotherapy improves EFS as compared to RA Only for the subgroup of randomized patients with INSS Stage 4 disease. Descriptive comparison of outcome data for patients with persistent disease documented by biopsy to historical data for the analogous patients from CCG-3981., Three years|Event-Free Survival (EFS) of Patients From the Non-randomized Portion of the Trial, EFS for patients receiving RA + Immunotherapy following the cessation of the randomized portion of the study., Three years|Incidence of Toxicities Assessed Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0, Proportion of patients experiencing at least one Grade 3 or higher toxicity., From enrollment to follow-up|Number of Courses of Therapy Delivered, Number of courses of therapy delivered for patients randomized to RA + Immunotherapy vs. patients non-randomly assigned to RA + Immunotherapy, excluding patients with persistent disease., Courses 1-6|Overall Survival (OS), Comparison to determine if RA + Immunotherapy improves OS as compared to RA Only. Comparison to determine if RA + Immunotherapy improves OS as compared to RA only and for the subgroup of randomized patients with INSS Stage 4 disease., Three years|Overall Survival (OS) of Patients From the Non-randomized Portion of the Trial, OS for patients receiving RA + Immunotherapy following the cessation of the randomized portion of the study., Three years","Average Level of HACA, The average level of HACA at each collection time point during immunotherapy will be calculated., Up to 10 years|Cardiac Repolarization, In general, descriptive summaries will include n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum and 90% confidence intervals for continuous variables, and n and percent for categorical variables. Summaries will present data by assessment time when appropriate., Up to 10 years|Change in MRD, A descriptive analysis of the change from baseline of MRD will be performed. Also, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be performed to compare the median change from baseline of MRD between the two treatment arms. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model will test to see if the change in MRD burden is associated with EFS or OS., Baseline to up to 10 years|Change in Tumor Biology, A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model will test to see if the dinutuximab serum level, HACA titer, effector cell function, or serum marker for effector cell activation are associated with EFS or OS., Baseline to up to 10 years|Circulating B7-H6 Levels, Kaplan-Meier plots of EFS and OS will be generated after dichotomization using the median value for the cohort. To determine the prognostic value of circulating B7-H6 level, univariate analysis will be performed using a log rank test for EFS and OS. In multivariable analysis of EFS and OS, Cox models will be used to test for the independent prognostic ability of circulating B7-H6 level, adjusting for significant prognostic factors including MYCN status, INSS stage, histology and age at diagnosis., 1 week before first sargramostim injection (day -1 of course 1)|Genotype of FcR, Kaplan-Meier plots of EFS will be generated for the three genotype subgroups of FcR as well as for the three genotype subgroups of Kir/Kir-ligand. In addition, a log rank test comparison will be made in a pairwise fashion of each of the genotypes within FcR and within Kir/Kir-ligand., Up to 10 years|Genotype of Kir/Kir-ligand, Kaplan-Meier plots of EFS will be generated for the three genotype subgroups of FcR as well as for the three genotype subgroups of Kir/Kir-ligand. In addition, a log rank test comparison will be made in a pairwise fashion of each of the genotypes within FcR and within Kir/Kir-ligand., Up to 10 years|Isotretinoin Pharmacokinetic Parameters, To determine if there is a relationship of the peak serum concentration level with EFS, the term for this level will be tested in a Cox proportional hazards model. To determine if there is a relationship of the peak serum concentration level with toxicity rates, Kendall's Tau statistic will be calculated., At 4 hours after administration on day 14 of course 1|Levels of ADCC, Will be descriptively compared., Up to 10 years|NKp30 Isoform Expression and SNP, Kaplan-Meier plots of EFS and OS will be generated after dichotomization using the median value for the cohort. To determine the prognostic value of NKp30 isoform expression and SNP, univariate analysis will be performed using a log rank test for EFS and OS. In multivariable analysis of EFS and OS, Cox models will be used to test for the independent prognostic ability of NKp30 isoform expression and SNP, adjusting for significant prognostic factors including v-MYC myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived (avian) (MYCN) status, INSS stage, histology and age at diagnosis., 1 week before first sargramostim injection (day -1 of course 1)|Presence of Naturally Occurring Anti-glycan Antibodies, A Fisher's exact test will be performed to determine if the presence of naturally occurring anti-glycan antibodies correlates with allergic reactions.
