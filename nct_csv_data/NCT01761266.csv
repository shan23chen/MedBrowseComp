NCT01761266,"A Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase 3 Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib (E7080) Versus Sorafenib in First-line Treatment of Participants With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01761266,,COMPLETED,"E7080-G000-304 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line systemic treatment in participants with unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).",YES,Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Sorafenib,"Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause (approximately up to 3.8 years)","Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), or date of death, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters of target lesions. As planned, data for this secondary endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., From the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death, whichever occurred first (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on mRECIST. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters of target lesions. As planned, data for this secondary endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., The time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on mRECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement of arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions. As planned, data for this secondary endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., From the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death, whichever occurred first (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Time to Clinically Meaningful Worsening of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Assessed Using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 included 30 questions comprising 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social) and 9 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties) and a single global health and QOL status score. Most questions used a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much); 2 questions used a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). All domain scores were calculated as an average of item scores and transformed to 0 to 100 score range. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problem. As planned, data for this secondary endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., Baseline up to Off-Treatment Visit (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Time to Clinically Meaningful Worsening of HRQoL Assessed Using - EORTC QLQ- Hepatocellular Carcinoma Domain (HCC 18), The EORTC QLQ-HCC-18 was an 18-item questionnaire design used along with the 30-item EORTC QLQ-C30. EORTC QLQ-HCC 18 questionnaire included 8 symptom scales such as fatigue, jaundice, body image, nutrition, pain, fever, sex life and abdominal swelling. Each individual item ranges from 1 to 4, where 1 = ""not at all"" and 4 = ""very much."" All domain scores were calculated as an average of item scores and transformed to 0 to 100 score range. A high score for a functional scale represented a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life (QoL) represented a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represented a high level of symptomatology/problem. As planned, data for this secondary endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., Baseline up to Off-Treatment Visit (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Time to Clinically Meaningful Worsening of HRQoL Assessed Using EuroQol Five Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), The EuroQol five dimension health questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) assesses quality of life along 5 dimensions. Participants rate 5 aspects of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) by choosing from 3 answering options (1=no problems; 2=some problems; 3=extreme problems). The summed score ranges from 3-15 with ""3"" corresponding to no problems and ""15"" corresponding to severe problems in the 5 dimensions. EQ-5D-3L also included an EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranges between 100 (best imaginable health) and 0 (worst imaginable health). Decrease from baseline in EQ-5D-3L signifies improvement. Total index EQ-5D-3L summary score was weighted with a range of -0.594 (worst) to 1.0 (best). EQ-5D-3L also included an EQ health utilities index (HUI) where 1.00 indicated perfect health while a score of 0.00 indicated death. As planned, data for this secondary endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., Baseline up to Off-Treatment Visit (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Area Under the Plasma Drug Concentration-time Curve (AUC) for Lenvatinib, AUC was assessed on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15. Summarized data for all time points was reported. As planned, data for this secondary endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1: pre-dose, 0.5-4 and 6-10 hours post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 15: pre-dose, 2-12 hours post-dose (cycle length= 28 days)","Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR, or stable disease (SD). Best overall response of SD must have been \>=7 weeks after randomization. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement of arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions. SD was when a case does not qualify for either PR or PD and was new non-target lesions. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters of target lesions. As planned, data for this pre-specified endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., From the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death, whichever occurred first (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR or durable SD (duration of SD \>=23 weeks after randomization). For participants whose best overall response (BOR) was SD, the duration of SD was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented PD or death, whichever occurred first. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement of arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions. SD was when a case does not qualify for either PR or PD. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters of target lesions. As planned, data for this pre-specified endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., From the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death, whichever occurred first (approximately up to 3.8 years)|Percent Change From Baseline in Serum Biomarker, The serum biomarkers analysed were angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as blood serum biomarkers, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) as a blood tumor marker in serum. As planned, data for this pre-specified endpoint was collected and analyzed up to the primary completion date., Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 7 Day 1, Cycle 8 Day 1, Cycle 9 Day 1 and at the Off-Treatment Visit (approximately up to 3.8 years)",Eisai Limited,Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,954,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,E7080-G000-304|2012-002992-33,2013-03-01,2016-11-13,2021-03-10,2013-01-04,2018-09-25,2022-04-05,"Facility #
