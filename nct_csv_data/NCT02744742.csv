NCT02744742,"G-CSF+Decitabine+BUCY vs BUCY Conditioning Regimen for RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML Secondary to MDS Undergoing Allo-HSCT",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02744742,,COMPLETED,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) appears to be an efficient tool to cure refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). At present, the best conditioning regimen for RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and AML secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of G-CSF+ Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in patients with RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML Secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.",NO,Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|Conditioning,DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Busulfan (BU)|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide (CY)|DRUG: Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor(G-CSF),"relapse rate, 2 year","overall survival (OS), 2 year|disease-free survival (DFS), 2 year|transplant-related mortality (TRM), 2 year",,"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University","Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University|Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, China|Peking University People's Hospital|First People's Hospital of Chenzhou|Liuzhou Workers Hospital",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,202,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,G-CSF+Dec+BUCYvsBUCY-MDS-2016,2016-04-18,2019-09-30,2021-09-30,2016-04-20,,2022-02-14,"Department of Hematology,Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China",
