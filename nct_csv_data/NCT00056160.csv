Complete Response (CR):Disappearance of monoclonal paraprotein. Remission Response (RR):75-99% reduction in monoclonal paraprotein/90-99% reduction in 24-hr urinary light chain excretion. Partial Response (PR):50-74% reduction in monoclonal paraprotein/50-89% reduction in 24-hr urinary light chain excretion. Stable Disease (SD):Criteria for PR or PD not met. Plateau Phase:If PR, stable monoclonal paraprotein (within 25% above or below nadir)/stable soft tissue plasmacytomas.
