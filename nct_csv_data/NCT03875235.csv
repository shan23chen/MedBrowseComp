Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. The second interim analysis was pre-specified after approximately 397 OS events occurred in both arms (59% maturity)., From date of randomization until death due to any cause. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 27 months (from date of randomization to primary analysis data cut-off)|Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 18 Months, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. The second interim analysis was pre-specified after approximately 397 OS events occurred in both arms (59% maturity)., From date of randomization until death due to any cause. Calculated at 18 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique.|Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 24 Months, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause.

Calculated at 24 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique.","Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS based on investigator assessments according to RECIST version 1.1 was defined as time from date of randomization until date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Progression (i.e., PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (TLs) and an absolute increase of ≥5mm, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters since treatment started including the baseline sum of diameters, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., Tumor assessments every 6 weeks after randomization for the first 24 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter until date of RECIST 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease or death. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 27 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 9 Months, PFS based on investigator assessments according to RECIST version 1.1 was defined as time from date of randomization until date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression.

Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., Tumor assessments every 6 weeks after randomization for the first 24 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter until date of RECIST 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease or death. Calculated at 9 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 12 Months, PFS based on investigator assessments according to RECIST version 1.1 was defined as time from date of randomization until date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Progression (i.e., PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (TLs) and an absolute increase of ≥5mm, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters since treatment started including the baseline sum of diameters, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., Tumor assessments every 6 weeks after randomization for the first 24 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter until date of RECIST 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease or death. Calculated at 12 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease assessments based on investigator assessments were determined by using RECIST version 1.1 guidelines. The ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR). The CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR was defined as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new non-target lesion. A confirmed CR or PR was defined as 2 CRs or 2 PRs with no evidence of progression in-between. Patients who discontinued randomized treatment without progression, received a subsequent anti-cancer therapy and then responded were not included as responders for ORR., Tumor assessments (per RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks relative to the date of randomization and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 27 months.|Duration of Response (DoR), The DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented OR (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) until date of documented progression (PD) based on investigator assessments by using RECIST version 1.1 or death in absence of disease progression (i.e. date of PFS event or censoring - date of first response + 1) . A confirmed CR was defined in above outcome measures. The PD was defined at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions (compared with nadir at 2 consecutive visits with an absolute increase of 5 mm), unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions or new lesion. For participants who were alive and no documented PD at the time of data cutoff for analysis, DoR was censored at the last evaluable disease assessment date.
