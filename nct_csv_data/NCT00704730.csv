NCT00704730,Efficacy of XL184 (Cabozantinib) in Advanced Medullary Thyroid Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00704730,EXAM,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) with XL184 as compared with placebo (an inactive substance) in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Subjects will be randomized to receive XL184 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. XL184 is an investigational drug that inhibits VEGFR2, MET and RET, kinases implicated in tumor formation, growth and migration.

The Clinical Steering Committee for this study, comprised of study doctors who specialize in medullary thyroid cancer, has provided guidance regarding the design of the study. The committee includes: Douglas Ball, MD, Barry Nelkin, PhD, Martin Schlumberger, MD and Steven Sherman, MD.",YES,Thyroid Cancer,DRUG: XL184|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The duration of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) using progression events as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) per mRECIST, or death due to any cause. The analysis was conducted after at least 315 subjects were randomized and at least 138 events were observed., Treatment period consisted of 4-week cycles with radiologic tumor assessment every 12 weeks from date of randomization until date of first documented PD or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 34 months.","Overall Survival (OS) With XL184 Compared With Placebo, Duration of Overall Survival (OS) from the time of randomization to death due to any cause. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the median., The pre-specified interim analysis of Overall Survival (OS) was assessed at 44% of required events. Includes data up to 15June2011. As of this date, the number of deaths required to conduct the primary analysis had not been reached.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC.) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Criteria (mRECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR) disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Overall Response Rate: ORR=CR +PR, Assessed at the same time as primary analysis of Progression Free Survival (PFS) data. Assessed at baseline and every 12 weeks until Progressive Disease (PD) up to 34 months.|Duration of Objective Response (OR): Independent Radiology Committee (IRC) Determined, For those subjects with Independent Radiology Committee (IRC) determined Objective Response Rate (ORR), the amount of time from documentation of Objective Response (OR) until Progressive Disease (PD) by mRECIST or death due to any cause., From time of first documentation of Objective Response (OR), confirmed at a later visit ≥28 days later as Progressive Disease (PD) as defined by mRECIST or death due to any cause, assessed up to 34 months.|Biochemical Response Calcitonin (CTN) %, For each on-treatment tumor marker assessment from each subject, the biochemical response of CTN was determined based on percent increase or decrease from baseline. Best biochemical response over course of treatment was determined from evaluation of subject's time point response data. Biochemical response criteria: Complete Response (CR) - decrease in tumor marker into normal range from baseline value; Partial Response (PR) - decrease of \>50% from baseline value when baseline value is above normal range; Stable Disease (SD) - no more than a 50% increase and no more than a 50% decrease from baseline value above normal range; Progressive Disease (PD) - increase of \>50% from baseline value when baseline value is above normal range / or increase from low or normal range at baseline to above normal range; Not Evaluable (NE) - missing baseline value / or baseline value is not elevated and response is not PD / or response can not be determined due to change in assay format., Serum tumor markers CTN evaluated from blood samples collected at screening and every 12 weeks (±5 days from randomization) until date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed for up to 34 months.|Biochemical Response Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) %, For each on-treatment tumor marker assessment from each subject, the biochemical response of CEA was determined based on percent increase or decrease from baseline. Best biochemical response over the course of treatment was determined from evaluation of each subject's time point response data. Biochemical response: Complete Response (CR)- Decrease in tumor marker into normal range from baseline value; Partial Response (PR)- Decrease of \>50% from baseline value when baseline value is above normal range; Stable Disease (SD)- No more than a 50% increase and no more than a 50% decrease from baseline value above normal range; Progressive Disease (PD)- Increase of \>50% from baseline value when baseline value is above normal range / or increase from low or normal range at baseline to above normal range; Not Evaluable (NE)- Missing baseline value / or baseline value is not elevated and response is not Progressive Disease (PD) / or response can not be determined due to change in assay format., Serum tumor markers CEA evaluated from blood samples collected at screening and every 12 weeks (± 5 days from randomization) until date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed for up to 34 months.",,Exelixis,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,330,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",XL184-301,2008-06,2011-10,2020-09,2008-06-25,2014-09-09,2021-04-20,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, United States|TGEN Clinical Research Service at Scottsdale Healthcare, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85258, United States|University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Burbank, California, 91505, United States|UCLA, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Stanford Cancer Center, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, United States|Washington Cancer Institute, Washington, District of Columbia, 20010, United States|H.
