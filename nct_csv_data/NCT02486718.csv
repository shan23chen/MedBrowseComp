NCT02486718,Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) Compared to Best Supportive Care Following Chemotherapy in Patients With Lung Cancer [IMpower010],https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02486718,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This is a Phase III, global, multicenter, open-label, randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of 16 cycles (1 cycle duration=21 days) of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) treatment compared with best supportive care (BSC) in participants with Stage IB-Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, as measured by disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by the investigator and overall survival (OS). Participants, after completing up to 4 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab for 16 cycles or BSC.",YES,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Pemetrexed,"Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population, DFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first recurrence of NSCLC or occurrence of new primary NSCLC as determined by the investigator or death, whichever occurs first.
