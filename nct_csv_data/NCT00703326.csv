NCT00703326,Phase III Study of Docetaxel + Ramucirumab or Placebo in Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00703326,,COMPLETED,"The objective of this study is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of the drug combination ramucirumab plus docetaxel to placebo plus docetaxel in previously untreated participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, unresectable, locally-recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.",YES,Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: ramucirumab (IMC-1121B)|DRUG: docetaxel|OTHER: Placebo,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as time from randomization until the first evidence of progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) or death from any cause; by Investigator assessment. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since baseline, progression in non-target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). Participants who neither progressed nor died were censored the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment if available or date of randomization if no post initiation radiographic assessment was available. If death or PD occurred after ≥2 missing radiographic visits, censoring occurred at date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visits. The symptomatic/clinical disease progression (deterioration) without documented radiologic progression did not constitute progression., Randomization to disease progression or death or until data cutoff of 31 Mar 2013 (up to 56 months)","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from randomization to death from any cause. Participants who were alive at data cut-off for the OS analysis or lost to follow-up were censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive., Randomization to death or until data cutoff of 29-May-2015 (up to 82 months)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented date of disease progression using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria; by Investigator assessment. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD since baseline, progression in non-target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). Participants who did not progress were censored at the last radiographic tumor assessment. If no post-baseline assessment was available censoring occurred at the date of randomization. If PD occurred after 2 or more missing radiographic visits, censoring occurred at the date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visits. The symptomatic/clinical disease progression (deterioration) without documented radiologic progression did not constitute progression., Randomization to disease progression or until data cutoff of 31-Mar-2013 (up to 56 months)|Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rate), Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of randomized participants achieving a best confirmed overall response of CR or PR using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0), based on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria; by Investigator assessment. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and no progression in non-target lesions., Randomization to disease progression or until data cutoff of 31-Mar-2013 (up to 56 months)|Duration of Response, Duration of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) measured from time criteria were first met for CR or PR until first date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST 1.0); by Investigator assessment. CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions and no progression in non-target lesions. PD defined as ≥20% increase in LD sum of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD since baseline, progression in non-target lesions or the appearance of ≥1 new lesion(s). Participants who did not relapse or die censored at day of last radiographic tumor assessment. If death or PD was after ≥2 missing radiographic visits, censoring was at date of last radiographic visit prior to missed visits. Symptomatic/clinical disease progression without documented radiologic progression did not constitute progression., Date of first CR or PR to PD or death or until data cutoff date of 31-Mar-2013 (up to 56 months)|Total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B): Change From Baseline to End of Therapy, FACT-B measures the following domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL): physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and additional concerns of breast cancer subscale (BCS) each with 6 or more items developed to measure problems specific to breast cancer symptoms plus additional items related to global QoL. Participants respond to each of the 36 questions on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) with a total scores range of 0-144. Higher scores indicate fewer symptoms and better HR-QoL., Baseline, End of Therapy or until data cutoff of 31-Mar-2013 (up to 56 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Clinically significant events were defined as serious adverse events (SAE) and other treatment-emergent non-serious adverse events (NSAE). A summary of SAEs and other NSAEs is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., First dose to study completion (up to 12.3 years)|Immunogenicity: Percentage of Participants With Treatment Emergent Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies Until Primary Data Cutoff of 31-Mar-2013, Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent positive for anti-ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) antibodies during the study. Participants were considered positive for anti-ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) antibodies if they exhibited a post-treatment antibody level that exceeded the positive upper cut point determined from the anti-ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) level seen in healthy untreated individuals., Baseline, prior to cycle 3 infusion, prior to cycle 5 infusion, onset of infusion reaction, resolution of reaction and 30 days following the event up to 56 months|Immunogenicity: Percentage of Participants Available After 31-Mar-2013 With Treatment Emergent Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies Until Data Cutoff From 01-Apr-2013 to 08-Sep-2016, Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent positive for anti-ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) antibodies during the study. Participants were considered positive for anti-ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) antibodies if they exhibited a post-treatment antibody level that exceeded the positive upper cut point determined from the anti-ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) level seen in healthy untreated individuals., Follow-up from 01-Apr-2013 to 08-Sep-2016 (Up to 56 -97 months)",,Eli Lilly and Company,,FEMALE,"ADULT,
