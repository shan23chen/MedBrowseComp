NCT01973387,A Study of PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) Versus Rituximab in Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Leukemia/Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01973387,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib versus rituximab in adult Asia Pacific region patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).,YES,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Ibrutinib,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death, whichever was first reported.
