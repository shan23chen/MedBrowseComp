NCT02394795,"Panitumumab and RAS, Diagnostically-useful Gene Mutation for mCRC",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02394795,PARADIGM,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy and mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab combination therapy in first-line treatment of chemotherapy-naive patients with KRAS/NRAS wild-type, incurable/unresectable, advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer.",YES,Colorectal Cancer,"DRUG: oxaliplatin (OXA), levofolinate calcium (l-LV), 5-FU, panitumumab|DRUG: oxaliplatin (OXA), levofolinate calcium (l-LV), 5-FU, bevacizumab","OS in Participants With Left-sided Tumors, OS was measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. The left-sided tumors were defined as primary tumors occupying a left-sided site include the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum., Up to approximately 60 months|Overall Survival (OS) in All Participants, OS was measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 60 months","Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Participants With Left-sided Tumors, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death due to any cause. The left-sided tumors were defined as primary tumors occupying a left-sided site include the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum., Up to approximately 60 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in All Participants, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 60 months|Response Rate (RR) in All Participants, RR was defined as number of participants who achieve Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) as the best overall response per RECIST version 1.1.The best overall response was CR, followed by PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), and not evaluable (NE). CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters as the best overall response after randomization., SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study)., Up to approximately 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR means that the period from the day when either CR or PR is first confirmed until the day of documented PD or the day of death due to all causes, whichever occurs earlier., Up to approximately 60 months|Number of Participants Treated With Curative Surgical Resection After Chemotherapy, Curative surgical resection was defined as complete resection., Up to approximately 60 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurred in the treatment period after receiving the protocol treatment., Up to approximately 60 months",,Takeda,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,823,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Panitumumab-3001|U1111-1164-9167|JapicCTI-142731|jRCTs031180246|UMIN000016776,2015-05-29,2022-01-14,2022-01-14,2015-03-20,2023-11-01,2023-11-01,"Ichinomiya, Aichi, Japan|Komaki, Aichi, Japan|Konan, Aichi, Japan|Nagakute, Aichi, Japan|Nagoya, Aichi, Japan|Okazaki, Aichi, Japan|Toyoake, Aichi, Japan|Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan|Toyokawa, Aichi, Japan|Toyota, Aichi, Japan|Yatomi, Aichi, Japan|Daisen, Akita, Japan|Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan|Misawa, Aomori, Japan|Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan|Yachiyo, Chiba, Japan|Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan|Toon, Ehime, Japan|Tsuruga, Fukui, Japan|Yoshida, Fukui, Japan|Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan|Koga, Fukuoka, Japan|Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan|Omuta, Fukuoka, Japan|Onga, Fukuoka, Japan|Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan|Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan|Koriyama, Fukushima, Japan|Shirakawa, Fukushima, Japan|Hashima, Gifu, Japan|Kakamigahara, Gifu, Japan|Minokamo, Gifu, Japan|Ogaki, Gifu, Japan|Okazai, Gifu, Japan|Maebashi, Gunma, Japan|Ota, Gunma, Japan|Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Japan|Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan|Kitami, Hokkaido, Japan|Kushiro, Hokkaido, Japan|Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan|Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan|Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan|Akashi, Hyogo, Japan|Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan|Himeji, Hyogo, Japan|Kobe, Hyogo, Japan|Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan|Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan|Kasama, Ibaraki, Japan|Ryugasaki, Ibaraki, Japan|Tsuchiura, Ibaraki, Japan|Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan|Hakusan, Ishikawa, Japan|Kaga, Ishikawa, Japan|Kahoku, Ishikawa, Japan|Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan|Nanao, Ishikawa, Japan|Morioka, Iwate, Japan|Kida, Kagawa, Japan|Marugame, Kagawa, Japan|Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan|Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan|Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Japan|Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan|Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan|Kanazawa, Kanagawa, Japan|Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan|Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan|Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan|Nankoku, Kochi, Japan|Matsuzaka, Mie, Japan|Tsu, Mie, Japan|Yokkaichi, Mie, Japan|Ishinomaki, Miyagi, Japan|Natori, Miyagi, Japan|Osaki, Miyagi, Japan|Sendai, Miyagi, Japan|Shibata, Miyagi, Japan|Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan|Saku, Nagano, Japan|Omura, Nagasaki, Japan|Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan|Ikoma, Nara, Japan|Tenri, Nara, Japan|Yamatotakada, Nara, Japan|Yufu, Oita, Japan|Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan|Naha, Okinawa, Japan|Tomigusuku, Okinawa, Japan|Urasoe, Okinawa, Japan|Hirakata, Osaka, Japan|Kawachinagano, Osaka, Japan|Moriguchi, Osaka, Japan|Neyagawa, Osaka, Japan|Osakasayama, Osaka, Japan|Suita, Osaka, Japan|Kawagoe, Saitama, Japan|Kitaadachi, Saitama, Japan|Koshigaya, Saitama, Japan|Moriyama, Shiga, Japan|Otsu, Shiga, Japan|Izumi, Shimane, Japan|Izumo, Shimane, Japan|Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan|Izunokuni, Shizuoka, Japan|Sunto, Shizuoka, Japan|Shimotsuga, Tochigi, Japan|Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan|Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan|Komatsushima, Tokushima, Japan|Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Machida, Tokyo, Japan|Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Musashino, Tokyo, Japan|Ota-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Yonago, Tottori, Japan|Kurobe, Toyama, Japan|Takaoka, Toyama, Japan|Sakata, Yamagata, Japan|Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan|Iwakuni, Yamaguchi, Japan|Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan|Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan|Akita, Japan|Aomori, Japan|Chiba, Japan|Fukui, Japan|Fukuoka, Japan|Gifu, Japan|Ibaraki, Japan|Kagoshima, Japan|Kochi, Japan|Kumamoto, Japan|Kyoto, Japan|Miyazaki, Japan|Nagano, Japan|Nagasaki, Japan|Niigata, Japan|Okayama, Japan|Okinawa, Japan|Osaka, Japan|Saga, Japan|Saitama, Japan|Shizuoka, Japan|Tokushima, Japan|Toyama, Japan|Yamagata, Japan","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/95/NCT02394795/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/95/NCT02394795/SAP_001.pdf"
