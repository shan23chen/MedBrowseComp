Participant responses to the GHS question ""How would you rate your overall health during the past week?"" (Item 29) and the QoL question ""How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?"" (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 15 in the GHS/QoL combined score, for the first course of treatment, was compared between all participants of the pembro mono arm and the control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. As specified by the protocol, change from baseline to Week 15 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between all participants of the pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record., Baseline, Week 15|Pembro Mono vs Control: TTD in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life (Items 29 and 30) Combined Score, EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Participant responses to the GHS question ""How would you rate your overall health during the past week?"" (Item 29) and the QoL question ""How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?"" (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100; a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. TTD in GHS/QoL defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline in GHS/QoL combined score, with confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in GHS/QoL combined score, for the first course of treatment, was compared between all participants of pembro mono arm and control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis; and compared separately between all participants of pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Pembro Mono vs Control: TTD in the EORTC QLQ- H&N35 Pain Score, EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 is a 35-item questionnaire developed to assess QoL of head and neck cancer participants and consists of 7 multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. Participant responses to the Pain scale (Items 31-34) were scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100; a higher score indicating more problems. TTD in EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 Pain Score defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline, with confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 Pain Score, for the first course of treatment, was compared between all participants of pembro mono arm and control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. Also per protocol, TTD in EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 Pain Score was compared separately between all participants of pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Pembro Mono vs Control: TTD in the EORTC QLQ- H&N35 Swallowing Score, EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 is a 35-item questionnaire developed to assess QoL of head and neck cancer participants and consists of 7 multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. Participant responses to the Swallowing scale (Items 35-38) were scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much).

TTD in EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 Swallowing Score defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline, with confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 Swallowing Score, for the first course of treatment, was compared between all participants of pembro mono arm and control arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis; and compared separately between all participants of pembro combo arm and control arm and is presented earlier in the record., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. The number of participants that experienced at least one AE, for the first course of treatment, was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 47 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
