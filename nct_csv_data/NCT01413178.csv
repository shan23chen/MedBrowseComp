NCT01413178,A Randomized Trial to Compare Busulfan + Melphalan 140 mg/m2 With Melphalan 200 mg/m2 as Preparative Regimen for Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01413178,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical research study is to compare Busulfex (busulfan) with or without Alkeran (melphalan) to learn which study therapy may be better at helping to control MM in patients who will receive an autologous stem cell transplant. The safety of this combination therapy will also be studied.
