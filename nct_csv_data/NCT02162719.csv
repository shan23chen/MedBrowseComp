Confirmed ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved either a complete response or partial response based on the investigator assessment that was confirmed by a repeat assessment no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response was first met. Participants for whom no records of post-baseline tumor assessments were reported were counted as non-responders. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Confirmed ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a complete response or partial response based on the investigator assessment that was confirmed by a repeat assessment no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response was first met. Subjects for whom no records of post-baseline tumor assessments were reported were counted as non-responders.

Most questions used 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much; 2 questions used 7-point scale \[1=very poor to 7=Excellent\]). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; a higher score=better level of functioning. For symptom scale scores, higher level=severe level of symptoms.
