Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 weeks from randomisation","Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent confirmed progression per RECIST version 1.1, or death (whichever occurred first), measured in weeks and months. For PFS assessment clinical progression (i.e., treatment discontinuation due to progression of disease) was also considered as an event., At Week 52 from randomisation|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent death, measured in weeks and months., At Week 52 from randomisation|Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Comparison of Safety profile. Safety was monitored by incidence of adverse events (AEs). AEs were coded as per MedDRA (version 20.1) and severity was graded according to NCI-CTCAE (version 4.03);, Week 1 to week 52|Immunogenicity Assessments (Anti-drug Antibodies [ADA] and Neutralizing Antibodies [NAb]), Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing ADAs (NAb). Analyses of ADA incidence rate, antibody titer, and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) (following the recommended 3-tier approach) were performed., At Weeks 1, 4, 10, 19, 34 and 52 from randomization and, at the End of Treatment Visit if, an ADA sample has not been collected within the previous 3 weeks",,mAbxience Research S.L.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,627,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",MB02-C-02-17,2018-02-06,2019-07-03,2020-02-27,2017-09-28,2021-03-26,2021-04-26,"MedRadius, Maceió, AL, Brazil|Instituto do Câncer do Ceará - ICC, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil|Centro Brasileiro de Radioterapia Oncologia e Mastologia, Goiânia, GO, Brazil|Hospital Erasto Gaertner - Paranaense de Combate ao Câncer, Curitiba, PR, Brazil|Instituto Nacional de Cancer- INCA, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil|Centro de Pesquisa e Educação da Serra Gaúcha (CEPESG), Caxias do Sul, RS, Brazil|IPCEM Universidade de Caxias Do Sul, Caxias do Sul, RS, Brazil|Hospital de Caridade de Ijuí, Ijuí, RS, Brazil|Instituto do Câncer - Hospital São Vicente de Paulo, Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil|Hospital São Lucas da PUCRS, Pôrto Alegre, RS, Brazil|Hospital de Câncer de Barretos, Barretos, SP, Brazil|Hospital de Base de São José do Rio Preto, São José do Rio Prêto, SP, Brazil|Centro de Pesquisa do Instituto Brasileiro de Controle do Câncer - IBCC, São Paulo, SP, Brazil|Instituto de Ensino e Pesquisa São Lucas, São Paulo, SP, Brazil|Hospital Santa Marcelina, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Central Hospital Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria|Acıbadem City Clinic Cancer Center UMHAT, Sofia, Bulgaria|Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Oncology Diseases Sofia District EOOD, Sofia, Bulgaria|Fundación Arturo López Pérez - Instituto Oncológico FALP, Santiago, Chile|Health & Care Spa, Santiago, Chile|Instituto Clinico Oncologico del Sur ICOS, Temuco, Chile|Oncocentro APYS, Viña del Mar, Chile|Cancer Center of Adjara Autonomous Republic, Batumi, Georgia|Acad.
