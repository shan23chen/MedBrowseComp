Subjects with an unknown or missing response were treated as non-responders; i.e., they were included in the denominator when calculating the percentages.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI:

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the Baseline sum LD.
