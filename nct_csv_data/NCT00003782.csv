NCT00003782,"Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA (cT1-3, N0-1, M0) Breast Cancer and Positive Axillary Lymph Nodes",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003782,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells remaining following surgery. It is not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective in treating breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of combination chemotherapy in treating women who have undergone surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: doxorubicin,"Overall Survival, 8 years|Disease Free Survival, time to event: breast cancer recurrence; second primary cancer; death from any cause as a first event","Toxicities Among the 3 Regimens, 9 years|Quality of Life Among Breast Cancer Patients, baseline, 9 weeks, and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months|Amenorrhea in Premenopausal Women, baseline, 9 weeks, and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months",,NSABP Foundation Inc,National Cancer Institute (NCI),FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,5351,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NSABP B-30|CDR0000066914,1999-03,2008-12,2012-12,2003-01-27,2012-10-31,2024-03-21,"Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Huntsville, Alabama, 35801, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99519-6604, United States|CCOP - Western Regional, Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006-2726, United States|City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, 91010-3000, United States|California Cancer Center, Fresno, California, 93720, United States|Sutter Health Western Division Cancer Research Group, Greenbrae, California, 94904, United States|Scripps Cancer Center at Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093-0658, United States|Loma Linda University Cancer Institute at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, 92354, United States|Pacific Shores Medical Group, Long Beach, California, 90813, United States|CCOP - Bay Area Tumor Institute, Oakland, California, 94609-3305, United States|Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of California Irvine Cancer Center, Orange, California, 92868, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Centers of the Desert, Palm Springs, California, 92262, United States|Stanford Cancer Center at Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, California, 94305-5408, United States|Sutter Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|Kaiser Permanente Medical Center/Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego, San Diego, California, 92120, United States|Catholic Healthcare West - Westbay Region, San Francisco, California, 94107-1728, United States|CCOP - Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|Kaiser Permanente Medical Center - Vallejo, Vallejo, California, 94589, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center at University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado, 80010, United States|CCOP - Colorado Cancer Research Program, Incorporated, Denver, Colorado, 80209-5031, United States|University of Connecticut Cancer Center at University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut, 06360-7106, United States|Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut, 06102-5037, United States|CCOP - Christiana Care Health Services, Wilmington, Delaware, 19899, United States|MBCCOP - Howard University Cancer Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20060, United States|Morton Plant Hospital, Clearwater, Florida, 33756, United States|Halifax Medical Center, Daytona Beach, Florida, 32114, United States|Baptist Regional Cancer Institute - Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida, 32207, United States|CCOP - Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, 33140, United States|University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|MD Anderson Cancer Center Orlando, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Sarasota, Florida, 34239, United States|Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|CCOP - Atlanta Regional, Atlanta, Georgia, 30342-1701, United States|Medical College of Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia, 30912-4000, United States|Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, 30905-5650, United States|Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813, United States|North Idaho Cancer Center, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 83814, United States|John H.
