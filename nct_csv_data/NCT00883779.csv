Patients will be randomized to receive gemcitabine (1250mg/m2 iv) on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin (75mg/m2) or carboplatin (5xAUC)on day 1, followed by Tarceva 150mg/day or placebo from day 15 to day 28 of each 4 week cycle for a total of 6 cycles,then followed by Tarceva or placebo monotherapy.The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.",YES,Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin)|DRUG: erlotinib [Tarceva]|DRUG: gemcitabine,"Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time, Tumor response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). PD was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS is the time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Participants who had neither progressed nor died at the time of data cut-off or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented or last date of follow up for progression of disease, whichever was last. Participants without post baseline tumor assessments who were known to be alive were censored at the time of randomization.
