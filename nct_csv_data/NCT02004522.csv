NCT02004522,A Phase 3 Study of Duvelisib Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CLL/SLL (DUO),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02004522,,COMPLETED,A Phase 3 clinical trial to examine the efficacy of duvelisib monotherapy versus ofatumumab monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL).,YES,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,DRUG: Duvelisib|DRUG: Ofatumumab,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was PFS, defined as time from randomization to the first documentation of PD as determined by blinded independent review or death due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years","Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is a key secondary efficacy endpoint with overall response defined as best response of CR, CRi, PR, or PRwL, according to the modified IWCLL/IWG Response Criteria, with modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis as defined in the protocol., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity assessed up to 6 years|Number of Subjects With Hematologic Improvements, Subjects with hematologic improvement included those subjects with abnormally high values for neutrophil count, hemoglobin, or platelet count at Baseline determined to have consistently met the criteria of an improvement for those parameters for a period of at least 60 days during which the subject did not have a transfusion or exogenous cytokines., 3 years|Overall Survival, A stratified Cox regression analysis was used to test for any treatment effect., Every 6 months for up to 3 years after first dose|Lymph Node Response Rate, Lymph node response defined as greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the SPD of target lymph nodes, 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is defined only for subjects demonstrating a response (eg, CR, CRi, PR, PRwL), with the response and progression statuses both determined by the blinded, central independent review. The analysis will be descriptive for each treatment group only., Time from the first documentation of response to first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Changes in Safety Laboratory Values, An analysis of TEAEs with an onset within the first 24 weeks of treatment was performed to examine and compare the incidence of events across an equal period for each treatment arm.Twenty-four weeks was anticipated to be the median exposure to ofatumumab., From 04 Feb 2014 till 19 June 2018|Number of Subjects With Samples Available for Duvelisib Pharmacokinetics (PK), Number of subjects with samples available for duvelisib Pharmacokinetics (PK), Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 7",,SecuraBio,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,319,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IPI-145-07|2013-002405-61,2013-11,2017-05-19,2021-06,2013-12-09,2019-01-08,2023-09-21,"La Jolla, California, 92093-0698, United States|Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Altamonte Springs, Florida, 32701, United States|Bonita Springs, Florida, 34135-4529, United States|Bradenton, Florida, 34209, United States|Brandon, Florida, 33511, United States|Cape Coral, Florida, 33990, United States|Clearwater, Florida, 33761, United States|Englewood, Florida, 34223, United States|Fort Myers, Florida, 33916, United States|Gainesville, Florida, 32605, United States|Hudson, Florida, 34667, United States|Inverness, Florida, 34453, United States|Largo, Florida, 33777, United States|Naples, Florida, 34119, United States|New Port Richey, Florida, 34655, United States|Orange City, Florida, 32763, United States|Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Port Charlotte, Florida, 33980, United States|Saint Petersburg, Florida, 33705, United States|Sarasota, Florida, 34236, United States|Spring Hill, Florida, 34608, United States|Tampa, Florida, 33607, United States|Tavares, Florida, 32778, United States|Venice, Florida, 34292, United States|Crestview Hills, Kentucky, 41017, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Saint Louis, Missouri, 63130, United States|Hackensack, New Jersey, 07601, United States|New Brunswick, New Jersey, 08903, United States|New York, New York, 10032, United States|New York, New York, 10065, United States|Cincinnati, Ohio, 45236, United States|Fairfield, Ohio, 45014, United States|Nashville, Tennessee, 37203, United States|Charlottesville, Virginia, 22903, United States|Bedford Park, 5042, Australia|East Melbourne, 3002, Australia|Melbourne, 3058, Australia|Vienna, 1090, Austria|Wels, 4600, Austria|Wien, 1130, Austria|Bruxelles, 1000, Belgium|Bruxelles, 1200, Belgium|Gent, 9000, Belgium|Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Sint- Niklaas, 9100, Belgium|Argenteuil, 95107, France|Bobigny, 93009, France|Bordeaux, 33076, France|Caen, 14033, France|Clermont-Ferrand, 63100, France|La Roche Sur Yon, 85025, France|Limoges Cedex, 87042, France|Nantes, 44000, France|Rennes, 35033, France|Vendœuvres, 54511, France|Berlin, 10707, Germany|Köln, 50937, Germany|Leer, 26789, Germany|Rostock, 18057, Germany|Ulm, 89081, Germany|Budapest, 1083, Hungary|Budapest, 1122, Hungary|Debrecen, 4032, Hungary|Gyor, 9024, Hungary|Kaposvár, 7400, Hungary|Pecs, 7624, Hungary|Szeged, 6725, Hungary|Catania, 95124, Italy|Lecce, 73100, Italy|Meldola, 47014, Italy|Milano, 20132, Italy|Milano, 20162, Italy|Padova, 35128, Italy|Ravenna, 48121, Italy|Rimini, 47923, Italy|Roma, 00133, Italy|Auckland, 1023, New Zealand|Palmerston North, 4442, New Zealand|Barcelona, 08035, Spain|Barcelona, 08036, Spain|Barcelona, 08041, Spain|Madrid, 28033, Spain|Madrid, 28050, Spain|Pamplona, 31008, Spain|Bournemouth, BH7 7DW, United Kingdom|Leeds, LS9 7TF, United Kingdom|Manchester, M20 4BX, United Kingdom|Nottingham, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom|Oxford, OX3 7JL, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/22/NCT02004522/Prot_001.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/22/NCT02004522/SAP_000.pdf"
