NCT01583426,Nanoparticle-based Paclitaxel vs Solvent-based Paclitaxel as Part of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Early Breast Cancer (GeparSepto),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01583426,GeparSepto,COMPLETED,"Current guidelines as those from the AGO-Breast commission recommend for neoadjuvant breast cancer patients either a sequence of 4 cycles EC followed by 4 cycles of a taxane or 6 cycles of TAC based on previous large scale studies.

Treatment of patients with HER2-positive disease should include also simultaneous application of trastuzumab.

Solvent-based taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) cause severe toxicities not only by the active agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) is a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile, allows higher dosing with shorter infusion duration, and produces higher tumor drug concentration.

As neoadjuvant treatment does not only allow to compare competing treatment approaches with a very high quality (homogenous treatment population, precise assessment of response by histological assessment), but also to identify predictive markers, this trial will compare weekly nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel at their currently optimal doses.
