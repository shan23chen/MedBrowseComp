The primary endpoint of PFS was based on independent review committee (IRC) assessment., From randomization to objective disease progression or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 20 months","Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death by any cause, whichever occurs first., From randomization to objective disease progression or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 20 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage (%) of participants with measurable disease with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR was based on investigator and IRC assessment., At baseline and every 6 weeks (±4 days) until disease progression, up to 20 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. DoR was based on both Investigator and IRC assessment., At baseline and every 6 weeks (±4 days) until disease progression, up to 20 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage (%) of participants who had a best overall response (BOR) of CR, PR or Stable disease (SD) ≥6 weeks prior to any progressive disease (PD) event, assessed by investigator and IRC., At baseline and every 6 weeks (±4 days) until disease progression, up to 20 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., From randomization to date of death from any cause, whichever came first, up to 36 months|Intracranial ORR (iORR), iORR is calculated as the ORR (CR+PR) of lesions in the brain for patients who have measurable disease in the brain at baseline. iORR was based on both Investigator and IRC assessment., At baseline and every 6 weeks (±4 days) until disease progression, up to 20 months|Intracranial PFS (iPFS), iPFS is defined as time from randomization to intracranial disease progression or death due to any causes, assessed by investigator and IRC., From randomization to objective intracranial disease progression or death, whichever came first, up to 20 months|Adverse event (AE), AE is defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related to the study medication. AEs are summarized by type, incidence, severity and relationship to study medication., At baseline and every 3 weeks (±4 days) for the first 6 weeks, and then every 6 weeks (±4 days) until objective disease progression or meet other withdrawal criteria, up to 36 months","Change From Baseline Scores on the functional assessment of cancer therapy - Lung (FACT-L) quality of life questionnaire, The FACT-L questionnaire consists of several major aspects of life (Physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being) as well as lung cancer subscale (symptoms, cognitive function, regret of smoking). Scores for item ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much)., At baseline and every 6 weeks (±4 days) until disease progression, up to 20 months","Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,362,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IBIO-103,2019-12-24,2022-07-30,2024-12-30,2019-12-20,,2024-08-23,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China|Liuzhou Workers Hospital, Liuzhou, China",
