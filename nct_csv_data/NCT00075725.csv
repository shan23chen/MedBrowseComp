NCT00075725,Dexamethasone Compared With Prednisone During Induction Therapy and Methotrexate With or Without Leucovorin During Maintenance Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00075725,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial is studying dexamethasone to see how well it works compared to prednisone during induction therapy. This trial is also studying methotrexate and leucovorin calcium to see how well they work compared to methotrexate alone during maintenance therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, prednisone, methotrexate, and leucovorin calcium, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",YES,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Adult B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Childhood B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Daunorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Leucovorin Calcium|DRUG: Mercaptopurine|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Pegaspargase|DRUG: Prednisone|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Thioguanine|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate,"Comparison of the Increase in Cure Rate of High Risk ALL Without Causing More Serious Side Effects Between Interventions, Event Free Probability., 5 years","Correlation of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Positive With Overall Survival (OS), Bone marrow MRD status is defined as positive with \>= 0.1 detectable leukemia cells, and negative with \< 0.1 detectable leukemia cells., 5 Years|Correlation of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative With Overall Survival (OS)., Bone marrow MRD status is defined as negative with \< .01 detectable leukemia cells., 5 years|Correlation of Early Marrow Response Status With MRD Positive., Bone marrow status is defined as: M1: \< 5% lymphoblasts; M2: 5-25% lymphoblasts; M3: \> 25% lymphoblasts.
