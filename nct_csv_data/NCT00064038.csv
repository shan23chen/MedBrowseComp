NCT00064038,"S0232 Dexamethasone With or Without Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Multiple Myeloma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00064038,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as dexamethasone use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether dexamethasone is more effective with or without lenalidomide in treating multiple myeloma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying dexamethasone and lenalidomide to see how well they work compared to dexamethasone alone in treating patients with previously untreated stage I, stage II, or stage III multiple myeloma.",YES,Multiple Myeloma|Plasma Cell Neoplasm,DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: lenalidomide|OTHER: placebo,"Progression-Free Survival, Progression is defined as a \> 25% increase from baseline in myeloma protein production or other signs of disease progression such as hypercalcemia, etc.

In patients with a confirmed Partial Remission, Remission, or Complete Remission, relapse is defined as the first occurrence of any of the following: 1) a myeloma protein increase by than 100% from the lowest level recorded on study, provided the absolute magnitude of this increase is at least 1g/dL for a serum monoclonal protein or at least 500 mg/24 hrs of urine M-protein; 2) a myeloma protein increase above the response criteria for Partial Remission, with the same requirements for the absolute magnitude of the protein increase; 3)reappearance of any myeloma peak that had disappeared while on protocol treatment, provided it meets the same requirements listed above; 4) increase in the size and number of lytic bone lesions recognized on radiographs., From date of initial registration to date of progression/relapse of disease or death from any cause, whichever came first, up to 5 years","Toxicity, Compare the toxicity profile of these regimens, including thrombotic complications, in these patients, based on CTCAE v. 3.0., From time of initiating study treatment until discontinuation of study treatment or of open-label REVLIMID + LOW DOSE DEX, whichever comes last, up to 5 years",,SWOG Cancer Research Network,National Cancer Institute (NCI),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,198,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",S0232|U10CA032102|S0232,2004-11,2008-10,2012-05,2003-07-09,2013-07-17,2015-03-25,"William Beaumont Hospital - Royal Oak Campus, Royal Oak, Michigan, 48073, United States|Utah Cancer Specialists at UCS Cancer Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84106, United States",
