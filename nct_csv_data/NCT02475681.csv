NCT02475681,"Acalabrutinib, Obinutuzumab and Chlorambucil in Treatment naïve CLL",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02475681,ElevateTN,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This Primary objective is evaluating the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (Arm A) compared with acalabrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab (Arm B) for the treatment of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Secondary objectives: 1) To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (Arm A) versus acalabrutinib monotherapy (Arm C) based on IRC assessment of PFS per IWCLL 2008 criteria.

2)To compare obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (Arm A) versus acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab (Arm B) and obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (Arm A) versus acalabrutinib monotherapy (Arm C) in terms of: IRC-assessed objective response rate (ORR); Tine to next treatment (TTNT); Overall Survival (OS)",YES,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Chlorambucil,"Progression-free Survival by IRC (Independent Review Committee) Assessment in Arm A Compared to Arm B, To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (Arm A) compared with acalabrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab (Arm B) based on IRC assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria (IWCLL; Hallek et al. 2008) with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson et al. 2012), hereafter referred to as IWCLL 2008 criteria, in subjects with previously untreated CLL. PFS, defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first IRC-assessed disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., IRC assessments were done from randomization date until disease progression or death or IRC discontinuation date on 08Feb2019 (as the IA based on this data cutoff date showed the study crossing superiority boundary) whichever comes first up to 40 months.","Progression-free Survival by IRC Assessment Arm A Versus Arm C, To evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (Arm A) compared with acalabrutinib monotherapy (Arm C) based on IRC assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria (IWCLL; Hallek et al. 2008) with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson et al. 2012), hereafter referred to as IWCLL 2008 criteria, in subjects with previously untreated CLL.
