Participants not meeting the criteria by the cutoff date were censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment date. Tumor response was evaluated by the investigator per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 every 8 weeks until radiographic disease progression. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or any new lesions., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.","Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death, with participants alive or lost to follow-up at the analysis data cutoff date censored at their last contact date., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response, Objective response was defined as having a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during first-line treatment, based on the investigator's review of scans using a modified-RECIST v1.0.

Complete Response: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions and no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions, or the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease and no new lesions., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.|Duration of Response, For participants with a confirmed objective response, the time from first confirmed objective response to radiologic disease progression per modified RECIST 1.0 criteria or death. For participants who responded and have not progressed or died, duration of response was censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.|Time to Disease Progression, Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of radiologic disease progression per modified RECIST 1.0 criteria. Participants not meeting criteria for disease progression by the analysis data cutoff date were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or any new lesions., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.|Time to Initial Objective Response, For participants with a confirmed objective response, the time from randomization to the date of first confirmed objective response. Assessments are based on the investigator's review of scans using a modified-RECIST v1.0. An objective response is defined as a best tumor response of complete or partial response. A complete or partial response was confirmed no less than 4-weeks after the criteria for response were first met., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.|Resection Rate, The resection rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a surgical procedure that resulted in partial reduction or complete eradication of all metastatic disease., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) in Participants With Wild-type Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (RAS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first disease progression, or death within 60 days after the last evaluable tumor assessment or randomization date (whichever was later).

A complete or partial response was confirmed no less than 4-weeks after the criteria for response were first met.

Complete Response: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions and no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions, or the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease and no new lesions., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 May 2012; median follow-up time was 60 weeks.|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response for Participants With Wild-type RAS / BRAF, Objective response was defined as having a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during first-line treatment, based on the investigator's review of scans using a modified-RECIST v1.0.

Fatal adverse events are classified as grade 5. Serious adverse events include any event that is fatal, life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or other significant medical hazard. Treatment-related AEs were those that the investigator considered a reasonable possibility that might have been caused by study drug., The time frame for adverse event reporting is from the first dose date to 30 days since the last dose date.
