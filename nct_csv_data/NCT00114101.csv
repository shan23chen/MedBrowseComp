NCT00114101,Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00114101,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide to see how well it works compared to a placebo in treating patients with multiple myeloma who are undergoing autologous stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving lenalidomide after autologous stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma.",YES,DS Stage I Multiple Myeloma|DS Stage II Multiple Myeloma|DS Stage III Multiple Myeloma|Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Smoldering Multiple Myeloma,PROCEDURE: Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Melphalan|PROCEDURE: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation|OTHER: Placebo Administration,"Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the date of transplant to date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. TTP was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.

Progression was defined per the International Myeloma Working Group definition as one more of the following:

* 25% increase in serum M-component (absolute increase \>= 0.5g/dl)
* 25% increase in urine M-component (absolute increase \>= 200mg/24hour
* 25% increase in the difference between involved and uninvolved Free Light Chain levels (absolute increase \>= 10mg/dl)
* 25 % increase in bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute increase of \>=10%)
* Definite development of new bone lesion or soft tissue plasmacytomas
* Development of hypercalcemia, Duration of study (up to 10years)","Response to Autologous Hematopoietic Stem-cell Transplant (HSCT) at Day 100, Response was defined according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria (2006)

* Complete Response: Complete disappearance of M-protein from serum \& urine on immunofixation, normalization of Free Light Chain (FLC) ratio \& \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow (BM)
* Partial Response: \>= 50% reduction in serum M-Component and/or Urine M-Component \>= 90% reduction or \<200 mg per 24 hours; or \>= 50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels
* Marginal Response: 25-49% reduction in serum M-component \& urine M-component by 50-89% which still exceeds 200mg/24hour
* Progressive Disease: Defined in primary outcome measure
* Stable Disease: Not meeting any of the criteria above, Day 100","Overall Survival, Overall Survival was measured from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause.
