NCT01639001,A Study Of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy In Previously Untreated ALK Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01639001,,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase III, Randomized, Open-label, Efficacy and Safety Study of Crizotinib single agent versus Chemotherapy Regimens (Pemetrexed/Cisplatin or Pemetrexed/Carboplatin) in First-Line ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) Positive East Asian Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that Crizotinib is superior to first-line chemotherapy pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in prolonging Progression Free Survival (PFS) in East Asian patients with advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC whose tumors harbor a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene locus.",YES,NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer),DRUG: Crizotinib|DRUG: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed/Carboplatin,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on IRR by Treatment Arm, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (by IRR) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occured first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date - randomization date +1)/30.44. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.1, as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Randomization to objective progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurred first, assessed up to 33 months)","Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Based on IRR, Percentage of participants with objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions., Randomization to objective progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (assessed up to 33 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. OS (in months) was calculated as (date of death - date of randomization +1)/30.44. For participants who were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent, the OS was censored on the last date that participants were known to be alive., From randomization to death or last date known as alive for those who were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent (assessed up to 64 months).|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at 12 Weeks Based on IRR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 12 weeks is defined as the percent of participants with CR, PR or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the IRR. The best response of SD can be assigned if SD criteria were met at least once after randomization at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions., From randomization to Week 12|Estimate of the Percentage of Participants Surviving at 1 Year and at 18 Months, Probability of survival 1 year and 18 month after randomization. The probability of survival at 1 year was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and a 2-sided 95% CI for the log \[-log(1-year survival probability)\] was calculated using a normal approximation and then back transformed to give a CI for the 1-year survival probability itself. The probability of survival at 18 months was estimated similarly., From randomization to 1 year and from randomization to 18 months|Duration of Response (DR) Based on IRR, DR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), as determined by the IRR, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. DR (in weeks) was calculated as (first date of PD or death - first date of CR or PR +1)/7. DR was only calculated for the subgroup of participants with an objective tumor response., From objective response to date of progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurred first, up to 33 months)|Time to Tumor Response (TTR) Based on IRR, TTR was defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) as determined by the IRR. For participants proceeding from PR to CR, the onset of PR was taken as the onset of response. TTR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with objective tumor response., Randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (up to 33 months).|Time to Progression (TTP) Based on IRR, TTP was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression, as determined by IRR.

It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a visual analog scale (VAS). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the 5 dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health)., From Baseline to deterioration while on study treatment. For participants with no deterioration, the data was censored at the last date when QLQ-LC13 assessment for pain, dyspnea, or cough was completed (assessed up to 33 months)|Percentage of Participants With Visual Disturbance as Assessed by Visual Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (VSAQ-ALK), VSAQ-ALK is a self-report measure that was developed to assess the problems of visual disturbances and symptoms may include the appearance of overlapping shadows and after images; shimmering, flashing or trailing lights; strings, streamers, or floaters; as well as hazy or blurry vision. The participants answered ""Yes"" to the first question (Q1) of VSAQ-ALK ""Have you experienced any visual disturbances?"" were considered to have experienced visual disturbance and were instructed to complete the rest of the questionnaire. The percentage of participants who responded to Q1 of VSAQ-ALK as ""Yes"" and as ""No"" during each study cycle was calculated as (n/N\*)\*100 where N\* was the number of participants who had completed Q1., Cycle 1 Day 1 to end of treatment or withdrawal, no later than 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) from last dose of study medication or when the decision was taken to withdraw from the study (whichever was sooner, assessed up to Cycle 86)|Agreement Between Central Laboratory ALK FISH and ALK IHC Test Results - Molecular Profiling Evaluable, Agreement between central laboratory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) test results is based on analysis of participants in the Molecular Profiling (MP) evaluable population that have an ALK IHC result and an ALK FISH result of either positive or negative only. This MP evaluable population included participants who screen failed, which their ALK test results were negative based on FISH test. Tumor tissue samples from these screen failure participants were consented and kept. These samples served as a part of negative sample set for evaluation of IHC test and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine ALK fusion events.
