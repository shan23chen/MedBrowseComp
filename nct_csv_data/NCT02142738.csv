NCT02142738,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Compared to Platinum-Based Chemotherapies in Participants With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-024/KEYNOTE-024),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02142738,,COMPLETED,"This is a study to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475/SCH 900475) compared to standard of care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapies in the treatment of participants with previously untreated stage IV, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) strong expressing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants with PD-L1 strong NSCLC will have a longer Progression Free Survival (PFS), as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) when treated with pembrolizumab than when treated with SOC platinum-based chemotherapies.

With Amendment 09 (20 December 2017), once participants have achieved the study objective or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.",YES,Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at Month 6, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first and was based on blinded independent central radiologists' (BICR) review. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression). Participants were evaluated every 9 weeks with radiographic imaging to assess their response to treatment. The data cutoff was 09-May-2016. The PFS rate at Month 6 was calculated., Month 6","Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. The data cutoff was 10-July-2017. The median OS rate at 12 months is presented., 12 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who experienced a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) and was assessed using RECIST 1.1 based on BICR evaluation. ORR was assessed from enrollment/treatment initiation of a participant through data cutoff of 09-May-2016.
