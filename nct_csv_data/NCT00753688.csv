NCT00753688,Pazopanib Versus Placebo in Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma Whose Disease Has Progressed During or Following Prior Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00753688,PALETTE,COMPLETED,A randomized double blind phase III trial of Pazopanib versus placebo in patients with soft tissue sarcoma whose disease has progressed during or following prior therapy,YES,"Sarcoma, Soft Tissue",DRUG: PAZOPANIB|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of either disease progression or death due to any cause. The diagnosis of progression was based on tumor measurements, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 criteria, by independent radiologic assessment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for PFS estimates., From the date of randomization until the date of the first documented radiological progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first (assessed for an average of 10 months)","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. The length of this interval was calculated as the date of death minus the date of randomization plus 1 day. Participants who were alive at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last follow-up. The interim OS analysis was conducted when 215 (77 percent \[%\]) of the 279 required death events had occurred in the study. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for OS estimates., From the date of randomization until 215 deaths (assessed for an average of 12 months)|Number of Participants in the Indicated Categories for Overall Response Assessed by an Independent Radiologist and the Investigator, Overall response is defined as the number of participants who had a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). According to RECIST, Version 1.0: CR, disappearance of all lesions; PR, a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive disease (PD), a \>=20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, or the appearance of \>=1 new lesion; Stable Disease (SD), neither PR nor PD, persistence of \>=1 non-TL. Participants with no follow-up radiological disease assessment were categorized as not evaluable (NE)., From the start of treatment until disease progression (assessed for an average of 10 months)|Time to Response Assessed by an Independent Radiologist and the Investigator, Time to response was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first). The Kaplan-Meier method was used for time to response estimates., From the date of randomization until the date of the first documented evidence of CR or PR (assessed for an average of 10 months)|Duration of Response Assessed by the Independent Radiologist and the Investigator, Duration of response was defined as the time from the date of the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the date of either the first documented sign of PD or death due to any cause. Participants who neither died nor progressed were censored at the date of the last adequate radiologic assessment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for duration of response estimates., From the date of randomization until the date of the first documented evidence of CR or PR (assessed for an average of 10 months)|PFS in the Indicated Histology Subgroups of Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS), PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of either disease progression or death due to any cause. Participants were analyzed for PFS in histology subgroups of STS (as per the World Health Organization \[WHO\] classification, 2008): leiomyosarcoma (malignant cancer of smooth muscle), synovial sarcoma (cancer near the joints of the arm or leg), and other STS (without the tumor type of leiomyosarcoma or synovial sarcoma), based on independent review.The Kaplan-Meier method was used for PFS estimates., From the date of randomization until the date of the first documented progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first (assessed for an average of 10 months)|Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Change from baseline in on-therapy SBP and DBP was calculated as the values at the indicated time points (Day 8 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 88, 96, and 104) minus the value at baseline., Baseline, Day 8, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 88, 96, and 104|Change From Baseline in Heart Rate, Change from baseline in on-therapy heart rate was calculated as the value at the indicated time points (Day 8 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 88, 96, and 104) minus the value at baseline., Baseline, Day 8, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 88, 96, and 104|Number of Participants With the Indicated Grade Shifts From Baseline Grade for Hemoglobin Level, Lymphocyte Count, White Blood Cell Count, Neutrophil Count, and Platelet Count, Shifts in hematology values by grade were summarized based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 3.0). Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE Version 3.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline. Participants with a missing baseline grade were assumed to have a baseline Grade of 0. Any increase in grade from baseline and shifts to Grade 3 (severe AE) and 4 (life-threatening or disabling AE) at any point in the study after baseline are reported., From baseline (Day 1) until study drug discontinuation or end of treatment (assessed for an average of 20 weeks)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Grade Shifts From Baseline Grade for Alkaline Phosphatase, Alanine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, Albumin, Creatinine, Hyper/Hypoglycemia, Hyper/Hypokalemia, Hyper/Hyponatremia, and Total Bilirubin, Shifts in clinical chemistry values by grade were summarized based on the NCI CTCAE Version 3.0. Participants with a missing baseline grade were assumed to have a baseline Grade of 0. Any increase in grade from baseline and shifts to Grade 3 and 4 at any point in the study after baseline are reported. alkaline phosphatase, ALKP; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; aspartate aminotransferase, AST. Hyper/hypoglycemia refers to high/low glucose; hyper/hypokalemia refers to high/low potassium; hyper/hyponatremia refers to high/low sodium., From baseline (Day 1) until study drug discontinuation or end of treatment (assessed for an average of 20 weeks)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Absolute Percent Change From Baseline (BL) in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) at Any Time Post-BL (Worst Case On-therapy), LVEF is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction and is used to determine cardiac function (based on the institutional lower limit of normal \[LLN\]). LVEF was assessed at BL, Week 12, and every second scheduled visit thereafter until study drug discontinuation and end of treatment or as clinically indicated by using multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO). Absolute change from BL was calculated as the on-study value minus the baseline value (LVEF is calculated as a percentage)., Baseline (within 14 days of the first dose of study drug) and any time
