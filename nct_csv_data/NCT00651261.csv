NCT00651261,"Daunorubicin, Cytarabine, and Midostaurin in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00651261,,UNKNOWN,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of a standard chemotherapy regimen for AML that includes the drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine combined with or without midostaurin (also known as PKC412), to find out which is better. This research is being done because it is unknown whether the addition of midostaurin to chemotherapy treatment is better than chemotherapy treatment alone. Midostaurin has been tested in over 400 patients and is being studied in a number of illnesses, including AML, colon cancer, and lung cancer. Midostaurin blocks an enzyme, produced by a gene known as FLT3, that may have a role in the survival and growth of AML cells. Not all leukemia cells will have the abnormal FLT3 gene. This study will focus only on patients with leukemia cells with the abnormal FLT3 gene.",YES,Leukemia,DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: daunorubicin|DRUG: midostaurin|OTHER: placebo|DRUG: dexamethasone acetate,"Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time interval from randomization to death from any cause. The median OS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Duration of study (Up to 10 years)","Event- Free Survival, Event free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from randomization until the earliest qualifying event, including: failure to obtain a CR on or before 60 days of initiation of protocol therapy; relapse; or death from any cause. Patients alive and event free at the time of analysis were censored on the date of last clinical assessment. The median EFS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Due to a higher than expected transplant rate, EFS was promoted to be a key secondary endpoint., Duration of study (Up to 10 years)|Overall Survival, Censoring Participants Who Receive a Stem Cell Transplant at the Time of the Transplant, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time interval from randomization to death from any cause. Any participants who received a stem cell transplant were censored at the time of transplant. The median OS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Duration of study (Up to 10 years)|Complete Response Rate, Percentage of participants who achieved a complete response (CR). A CR was defined as normalization of blood counts and a marrow showing less than 5% blasts occurring on or before day 60., Induction therapy (up to 60 days)|Disease-free Survival (DFS), Disease free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from documentation of first CR at any time to the first of relapse or death from any cause in participants who achieved a CR., Duration of study (Up to 10 years)|DFS Rate One Year After Completing the Planned Continuation Phase, 30 months",,Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Novartis Pharmaceuticals,ALL,ADULT,PHASE3,717,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CALGB-10603|CALGB-10603|EUDRACT-2006-006852-37|CDR0000590404,2008-04,2016-07,,2008-04-02,2017-02-06,2021-08-18,"UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, United States|Arkansas Cancer Research Center at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|University of California Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Aurora Presbyterian Hospital, Aurora, Colorado, 80012, United States|Boulder Community Hospital, Boulder, Colorado, 80301-9019, United States|Penrose Cancer Center at Penrose Hospital, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80933, United States|St. Anthony Central Hospital, Denver, Colorado, 80204, United States|Porter Adventist Hospital, Denver, Colorado, 80210, United States|Presbyterian - St. Luke's Medical Center, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|St. Joseph Hospital, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Rose Medical Center, Denver, Colorado, 80220, United States|CCOP - Colorado Cancer Research Program, Denver, Colorado, 80224-2522, United States|Swedish Medical Center, Englewood, Colorado, 80110, United States|North Colorado Medical Center, Greeley, Colorado, 80631, United States|Sky Ridge Medical Center, Lone Tree, Colorado, 80124, United States|Hope Cancer Care Center at Longmont United Hospital, Longmont, Colorado, 80501, United States|McKee Medical Center, Loveland, Colorado, 80539, United States|North Suburban Medical Center, Thornton, Colorado, 80229, United States|Exempla Lutheran Medical Center, Wheat Ridge, Colorado, 80033, United States|Helen and Harry Gray Cancer Center at Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut, 06102-5037, United States|Tunnell Cancer Center at Beebe Medical Center, Lewes, Delaware, 19958, United States|CCOP - Christiana Care Health Services, Newark, Delaware, 19713, United States|University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0232, United States|Memorial Cancer Institute at Memorial Regional Hospital, Hollywood, Florida, 33021, United States|Baptist Cancer Institute - Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida, 32207, United States|Florida Hospital Cancer Institute at Florida Hospital Orlando, Orlando, Florida, 32803-1273, United States|H.
