NCT00333775,A Study of Bevacizumab (Avastin) in Women With HER2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00333775,,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of Avastin in combination with docetaxel, versus docetaxel plus placebo, in patients with metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer who are candidates for taxane-based chemotherapy but who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The anticipated time on treatment is 1-2 years and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Placebo to bevacizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab,"Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0). Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the time of the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesion(s)., Baseline to the 15 Sep 2008 cut-off date (up to 2 years, 6 months)","Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response or a Partial Response, Responses were evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions or the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. A partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter., Baseline to the 15 Sep 2008 cut-off date (up to 2 years, 6 months)|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time from the first documented complete response or partial response to disease progression or death. A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions or the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. A partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. Responses were evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors., Baseline to the 15 September 2008 cut-off date (up to 2 years, 6 months)|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure was defined as time from randomization to the date of disease progression, death, or withdrawal of treatment due to an adverse event, withdrawal of informed consent, insufficient therapeutic response, refusal of treatment/failure to co-operate, or failure to return, whichever occurred first., Baseline to the 15 September 2008 cut-off date (up to 2 years, 6 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Baseline to the 15 Sep 2008 cut-off date (up to 2 years, 6 months)",,Hoffmann-La Roche,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,736,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",BO17708|2005-003862-40,2006-03,2007-10,2013-10,2006-06-06,2016-01-27,2016-01-27,"Adelaide, New South Wales, 5011, Australia|Camperdown, New South Wales, 2050, Australia|Westmead, New South Wales, 2145, Australia|Auchenflower, Queensland, 4066, Australia|Box Hill, Victoria, 3128, Australia|Fitzroy, Victoria, 3065, Australia|Ringwood East, Victoria, 3135, Australia|Perth, Western Australia, 6000, Australia|Graz, 8036, Austria|Salzburg, 5020, Austria|Vöcklabruck, 4840, Austria|Wien, 1090, Austria|Bruxelles, 1000, Belgium|Wilrijk, 2610, Belgium|Goiania, GO, 74605-070, Brazil|Belo Horizonte, MG, 31190-131, Brazil|Porto Alegre, RS, 90610-000, Brazil|Florianopolis, SC, 88034-000, Brazil|Barretos, SP, 14784-400, Brazil|Sao Paulo, SP, 01509-010, Brazil|Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1V7, Canada|Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada|Sudbury, Ontario, P3E 5J1, Canada|Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, H4J 1C5, Canada|Quebec, G1S 4L8, Canada|Beijing, 100021, China|Besancon, 25030, France|Bordeaux, 33076, France|Caen, 14076, France|Clermont Ferrand, 63011, France|Dijon, 21079, France|Lille, 59020, France|Montpellier, 34298, France|Villejuif, 94805, France|Ansbach, 91522, Germany|Berlin, 14195, Germany|Düsseldorf, 40225, Germany|Erlangen, 91054, Germany|Frankfurt am Main, 60389, Germany|Frankfurt, 60596, Germany|Halle, 06120, Germany|Hamburg, 20246, Germany|Heidelberg, 69120, Germany|Jena, 07743, Germany|Lemgo, 32657, Germany|München, 81675, Germany|Stuttgart, 70376, Germany|Trier, 54290, Germany|Tübingen, 72076, Germany|Ulm, 89075, Germany|Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, 40138, Italy|Modena, Emilia-Romagna, 41100, Italy|Parma, Emilia-Romagna, 43100, Italy|Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 34100, Italy|Udine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 33100, Italy|Treviglio, Lombardia, 24047, Italy|Macerata, Marche, 62100, Italy|Biella, Piemonte, 13900, Italy|Taormina, Sicilia, 98030, Italy|Seoul, 120-752, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 135-710, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|Kaunas, 50009, Lithuania|Vilnius, 08660, Lithuania|Merida, 97500, Mexico|Mexicali, 21100, Mexico|Mexico City, 06760, Mexico|Monterrey, 64380, Mexico|Obregon, 85000, Mexico|Puebla, 72530, Mexico|Sittard, 6131 BK, Netherlands|Utrecht, 3582 KE, Netherlands|Panama City, 83-0669, Panama|Krakow, 31-826, Poland|Olsztyn, 10-513, Poland|Poznan, 60-569, Poland|Warszawa, 02-781, Poland|Wroclaw, 53-413, Poland|Coimbra, 3000-075, Portugal|Lisboa, 1099-023, Portugal|Bucuresti, 022328, Romania|Pretoria, 0002, South Africa|Sandton, 2196, South Africa|Barcelona, 08003, Spain|Barcelona, 08035, Spain|Barcelona, 08036, Spain|Barcelona, 08907, Spain|Jaen, 23007, Spain|Madrid, 28041, Spain|Malaga, 29010, Spain|Linkoeping, 58185, Sweden|Lund, 22185, Sweden|Umea, 90185, Sweden|Chur, 7000, Switzerland|Kaohsiung, 813, Taiwan|Taipei, 100, Taiwan|Taipei, 114, Taiwan|Bangkok, 10400, Thailand|Bangkok, 10700, Thailand|Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand|Bournemouth, BH7 7DW, United Kingdom|Cambridge, CB2 2QQ, United Kingdom|Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, United Kingdom|Leeds, LS16 5WW, United Kingdom|Leeds, LS9 7TF, United Kingdom|London, SE1 7EH, United Kingdom|Manchester, M20 4BX, United Kingdom|Middlesex, HA6 2RN, United Kingdom|Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, United Kingdom|Truro, TR1 3LJ, United Kingdom",
