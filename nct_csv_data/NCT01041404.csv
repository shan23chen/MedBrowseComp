NCT01041404,ToGA Study - A Study of Herceptin (Trastuzumab) in Combination With Chemotherapy Compared With Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With HER2-Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01041404,,COMPLETED,"This parallel, randomized, open-label, multi-centre study will evaluate the effect on overall survival of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in combination with a chemotherapy compared to the chemotherapy alone in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) will be administered as intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg (loading dose 8 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. The chemotherapy consists of a combination of 6 cycles of fluorouracil (800 mg/m2/day intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion every 3 weeks), or capecitabine (Xeloda, 1000 mg/m2 po twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) will continue until disease progression.

For TLs, SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as a reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment had started.
