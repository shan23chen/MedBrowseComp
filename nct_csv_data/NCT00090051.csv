NCT00090051,FCR Versus FC Alone in the Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) in Relapsed Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00090051,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to provide treatment for patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and to compare the use of rituximab added to fludarabine+cyclophosphamide (FC) with FC alone, to determine if rituximab lengthens the time a patient remains free of leukemia symptoms.",YES,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Progression-free survival as assessed by the IRC was defined as the time between randomization and the date of first documented disease progression, relapse after response, or death from any cause, whichever came first. Patients without a PFS event were censored at their last tumor assessment date., Mean observation time at time of analysis was approximately 26 months|Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival (PFS) Events Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Progression-free survival as assessed by the IRC was defined as the time between randomization and the date of first documented disease progression, relapse after response, or death from any cause (PFS events), whichever came first.

Patients without an EFS event were censored at their last tumor assessment date., Mean observation time at time of analysis was approximately 26 months|Disease-free Survival (DFS), Disease free survival was defined for all patients with a best overall response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) and measured the time from first documented CR in a sequence of consecutive CRs until documented disease progression, relapse or death from any cause.
