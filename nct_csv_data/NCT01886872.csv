NCT01886872,"Rituximab and Bendamustine Hydrochloride, Rituximab and Ibrutinib, or Ibrutinib Alone in Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01886872,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies rituximab with bendamustine hydrochloride or ibrutinib to see how well they work compared to ibrutinib alone in treating older patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Chemotherapy drugs, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether rituximab with bendamustine hydrochloride may work better than rituximab and ibrutinib or ibrutinib alone in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",YES,Stage I Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage III Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage IV Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,DRUG: Bendamustine Hydrochloride|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Aspiration|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Ibrutinib|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the progression free survival distributions for each arm, with median estimates provided. Progression is defined as any one of the following: an increase in number of blood lymphocytes by \>= 50% with \>= 5000 B lymphocytes/mL in patients on Arm A or those on Arms 2 or 3 no longer receiving ibrutinib, \>= 50% increase in the products of at least 2 lymph nodes on 2 consecutive determination 2 weeks apart, \>= 50% increase in the size of the liver/spleen, transformation to a more aggressive histology, progression of any cytopenia (i.e. decrease of Hb levels \> 2g/dL). Progression free survival time will be the time to either progression or death whichever occurs first., Time from study entry to the time of documented disease progression or death. The analysis was event driven, performed at 2.5 years after the last patient enrolled;up to 4 years.","Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 2 Years, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the rate of progression free survival at 2 years in each treatment arm. Progression is defined as any one of the following: an increase in number of blood lymphocytes by \>= 50%, \>= 50% increase in the products of at least 2 lymph nodes on 2 consecutive determination 2 weeks apart, \>= 50% increase in the size of the liver/spleen, transformation to a more aggressive histology, progression of any cytopenia (i.e. decrease of Hb levels \> 2g/dL). Progression free survival time will be the time to either progression or death whichever occurs first., Time from study entry to the time of documented disease progression or death, assessed up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) at 2 Years, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the rate of overall survival at 2 years in each treatment arm. OS will be measured from the date of registration to the date of the event (i.e., death) or the date of last follow-up to evaluate that event. Patients who are event-free at their last follow-up evaluation will be censored at that time point., From the date of registration to the date of death, assessed up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) (Complete Response [CR], CCR, Nodular Partial Response [nPR], Partial Response [PR], and PRL), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate median DOR. DOR is the time from first objective status to progression or death. CR requires all of the following: absence of lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm on physical exam/CT scan, no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly on physical exam, no clonal B-cells in the blood, Normal CBC, bone marrow aspirate \& biopsy must be normocellular for age. PR requires \>= 50% decrease in peripheral lymphocyte count from pre-treatment value, \>= 50% reduction in lymphadenopathy, and/or ≥ 50% reduction in splenomegaly/hepatomegaly. CR with exception of having bone marrow lymphoid CLL nodules will be considered a nodular PR (nPR). CR with exception of not having a bone marrow biopsy performed will be considered a clinical CR (CCR). PR with the exception of having less than a 50% reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count will be considered a PR except persistent lymphocytosis (PRL)., From the date of first response until progression or death, performed at 2.5 years after the last patient enrolled; up to 4 years.|Percentage of Patients Achieving Any Response to Treatment (Overall Response Rate [ORR] [Complete Response [CR], CCR, Nodular Partial Response [nPR], Partial Response [PR], and PRL]), Complete response (CR) requires all of the following: absence of lymphadenopathy \>1.5 cm on physical exam/CT scan, no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly on physical exam, no clonal B-cells in the blood, Normal CBC, bone marrow aspirate \& biopsy must be normocellular for age. Partial response (PR) requires \>= 50% decrease in peripheral lymphocyte count from pre-treatment value, \>= 50% reduction in lymphadenopathy, and/or ≥ 50% reduction in splenomegaly/hepatomegaly. CR with exception of having bone marrow lymphoid CLL nodules will be considered a nodular PR (nPR). CR with exception of not having a bone marrow biopsy performed will be considered a clinical CR (CCR). PR with the exception of having less than a 50% reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count will be considered a PR except persistent lymphocytosis (PRL).Overall response rate and corresponding exact binomial 95% CI provided., Performed at 2.5 years after the last patient enrolled;up to 4 years.|Percentage of Patients Achieving a Biopsy-proven Complete Response (CR), Complete response (CR) requires all of the following: absence of lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm on physical exam/CT scan, no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly on physical exam, no clonal B-cells in the blood, Normal CBC, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be normocellular for age. Complete response rate and corresponding exact binomial 95% confidence intervals provided., Performed at 2.5 years after the last patient enrolled; up to 4 years.|Percentage of Patients Achieving Complete (CR and CCR) or Nodular Partial Response (nPR), Complete response (CR) requires all of the following: absence of lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm on physical exam/CT scan, no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly on physical exam, no clonal B-cells in the blood, Normal CBC, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be normocellular for age.
