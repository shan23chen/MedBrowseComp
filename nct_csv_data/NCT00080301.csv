NCT00080301,Novel Epothilone Plus Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Alone in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00080301,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-247550 added to the approved therapy of capecitabine is better than capecitabine alone in shrinking or slowing the growth of the cancer in women with metastatic breast cancer who are resistant to taxane and received anthracycline chemotherapy. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.,YES,Breast Cancer|Metastases,DRUG: Ixabepilone + Capecitabine|DRUG: Capecitabine,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRRC), PFS defined as the time in months from randomization to date of progression. Patients who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on date of death; those who didn't progress or die were censored on date of last tumor assessment. Median PFS time with 95% CI estimated using the Kaplan Meier product limit method., based on assessments every 6 weeks while on treatment until documented disease progression/unacceptable toxicity","Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per IRRC, Participants with best response of ""Complete"" or ""Partial"" according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) a 4-item scale wherein complete response=disappearance of all target lesions and partial response=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, based on assessments every 6 weeks while on treatment until documented disease progression/unacceptable toxicity|Duration of Response Per IRRC, Computed for all patients with a best response of ""Partial"" or ""Complete"" per RECIST (a 4-item scale as described in previous outcome measure), calculated from the time when these criteria were first met until the first date of documented progression or death., based on assessments every 6 weeks while on treatment until documented disease progression/unacceptable toxicity|Time to Response Per IRRC, Time to response was summarized using descriptive statistics and was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until measurement criteria were first met for Partial Response or Complete Response., based on assessments every 6 weeks while on treatment until documented disease progression/unacceptable toxicity|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants who did not die at the time of the analysis were censored at the latest follow-up date. Median OS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan Meier product limit method., from date of randomization until death|Treatment-related Safety Summary, Laboratory values, adverse events, and other symptoms were graded using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC) Version 3.0, safety was assessed on a continual basis every cycle while on-treatment and every 4 weeks post treatment until toxicities resolved or were deemed irreversible.|Symptom Assessment Score Changes From Baseline for Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Symptom Index (FBSI), Quality of life, as measured by the FBSI, an 8-item, participant-reported instrument to measure symptoms. Each item has 5 possible responses ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The scoring was conducted according to the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy manual, Version 4; higher scores reflect fewer symptoms., Baseline and prior to each 21-day cycle of treatment, and at first posttreatment follow-up assessment.",,R-Pharm,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,752,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CA163-046,2003-09,2006-11,2008-03,2004-03-30,2009-08-17,2020-11-02,"Local Institution, Little Rock, Arkansas, United States|Local Institution, San Francisco, California, United States|Local Institution, Vallejo, California, United States|Local Institution, Denver, Colorado, United States|Local Institution, Hartford, Connecticut, United States|Local Institution, Washington, District of Columbia, United States|Local Institution, Orlando, Florida, United States|Local Institution, Baltimore, Maryland, United States|Local Institution, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States|Local Institution, Jackson, Mississippi, United States|Local Institution, Columbia, Missouri, United States|Local Institution, Kansas City, Missouri, United States|Local Institution, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States|Local Institution, Omaha, Nebraska, United States|Local Institution, Livingston, New Jersey, United States|Local Institution, New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States|Local Institution, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States|Local Institution, New York, New York, United States|Local Institution, Columbus, Ohio, United States|Local Institution, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States|Local Institution, Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States|Local Institution, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States|Local Institution, Columbia, South Carolina, United States|Local Institution, Greenville, South Carolina, United States|Local Institution, Knoxville, Tennessee, United States|Local Institution, Nashville, Tennessee, United States|Local Institution, Austin, Texas, United States|Local Institution, Houston, Texas, United States|Local Institution, Ogden, Utah, United States|Local Institution, Burlington, Vermont, United States|Local Institution, Tacoma, Washington, United States|Local Institution, Morgantown, West Virginia, United States|Local Institution, Capital Federal, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Local Institution, Haedo, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Local Institution, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Local Institution, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Local Institution, Pilar, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Local Institution, Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Local Institution, Lanus, BuenosAires, Argentina|Local Institution, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina|Local Institution, Cordoba, Argentina|Local Institution, Neuquen, Argentina|Local Institution, Santa Fe, Argentina|Local Institution, Edegem, Belgium|Local Institution, Gent, Belgium|Local Institution, Leuven, Belgium|Local Institution, Liege, Belgium|Local Institution, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil|Local Institution, Belo Horizonte, Mina Gerais, Brazil|Local Institution, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil|Local Institution, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande Do Sul, Brazil|Local Institution, Jau, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Local Institution, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Local Institution, Sao Paulo -
