NCT02131064,A Study Evaluating Trastuzumab Emtansine Plus Pertuzumab Compared With Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab for Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02131064,,COMPLETED,"This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, two-arm study in treatment-naive participants with operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory, centrally-assessed HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) whose primary tumors were greater than or equal to (\>/=) 2 centimeters (cm). The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine + pertuzumab (experimental arm; T-DM1 + P) versus chemotherapy, trastuzumab + pertuzumab (control arm; TCH + P). The study comprised a neoadjuvant treatment period, followed by surgery, and an adjuvant treatment period.

Treatment can be stopped due to disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.",YES,Breast Neoplasms,DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab Emtansine,"Percentage of Participants With Total Pathological Complete Response (tpCR) Assessed Based on Tumor Samples, tpCR was assessed by local pathology review on samples taken at surgery following completion of neoadjuvant therapy. tpCR was defined as the absence of any residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes ( that is \[i.e.\], ypT0/is, ypN0 in the American Joint Committee on Cancer \[AJCC\] staging system, 7th edition). Percentage of participants with tpCR was reported., Pre-surgery (within 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy; up to approximately 6 months)","Overall Survival, Overall survival in the overall study population was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. 3 years OS event-free rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after treatment., From randomization until death (up to approximately 47 months)|Percentage of Participants Who Received Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS), BCS rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieve BCS out of the ITT population of participants without inflammatory breast cancer., Surgery performed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy (approximately 6 months after neoadjuvant period)|Event-Free Survival, Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral, invasive or non-invasive), or death from any cause. 3 years EFS rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after treatment., From randomization up to disease progression or recurrence or death (up to approximately 47 months)|Invasive Disease-free Survival (IDFS), IDFS is defined only for participants who undergo surgery. IDFS is defined as the time from surgery to the first documented occurrence of an IDFS event, defined as: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence; Ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence; Distant recurrence; Contralateral invasive breast cancer; and death from any cause. 3 years of IDFS event-free rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after treatment., From surgery to the first documented occurrence of IDFC event (up to approximately 47 months)|Percentage of Participants by Response for Neuropathy Single Item, Participants answered the question ""Did you have tingling hands/feet?"", from the Modified Quality of Life Questionnaire Breast Cancer 23 (mQLQ-BR23), on a 5-point scale (1 'Not at all', 2 'A little', 3 'Somewhat', 4 'Quite a bit', 5 'Very much').
