NCT00108953,A Research Study to Treat Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00108953,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of doxorubicin plus sorafenib versus doxorubicin plus placebo in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).,YES,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006) plus Doxorubicin|DRUG: Doxorubicin/Placebo","Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from randomization to radiological disease progression by independent assessment., from date of randomization of the first patient until 3 years later","Overall Survival, The time from date of randomization to date of death, from date of randomization of the first patient until 3 years later|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented radiological progression (as defined per independent central radiological assessment) or death, whichever occurs first, from date of randomization of the first patient until 3 years later|Percentage of Participants in Each Category of Best Tumor Response, Percentage of participants with complete or partial response (CR or PR) confirmed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and achieved during treatment or 30 days after end of treatment. CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological tumor lesions. PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters of tumor lesions.
