Gemcitabine hydrochloride may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, molecules that contain instructions for the proper development and functioning of cells), which in turn stops the tumor from growing. The protein WEE1 may help to repair the damaged tumor cells, so the tumor continues to grow. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may block the WEE1 protein activity and may increase the effectiveness of gemcitabine hydrochloride by preventing the WEE1 protein from repairing damaged tumor cells without causing harm to normal cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may be an effective treatment for recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer receiving gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in combination with AZD 1775 (MK-1775 \\[WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775\\]) compared to subjects receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.
