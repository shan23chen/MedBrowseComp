NCT00003934,"Tretinoin, Cytarabine, and Daunorubicin Hydrochloride With or Without Arsenic Trioxide Followed by Tretinoin With or Without Mercaptopurine and Methotrexate in Treating Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003934,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial is studying tretinoin and combination chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to tretinoin, combination chemotherapy, and arsenic trioxide in treating patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia that has not been treated previously. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Tretinoin may help leukemia cells develop into normal white blood cells. It is not yet known which regimen is more effective for acute promyelocytic leukemia.",NO,Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(15;17)(q22;q12)|Adult Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (M3)|Childhood Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (M3)|Untreated Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Untreated Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies,DRUG: tretinoin|DRUG: daunorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: mercaptopurine|DRUG: methotrexate|DRUG: arsenic trioxide,"Response rates, Up to 10 years|Distributions of event-free survival, Up to 10 years|Disease-free survival, Time from the date of the maintenance randomization to relapse or death, assessed up to 10 years|Survival, Up to 10 years|Toxicities for the various therapies graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) v2.0, Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment",,,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,420,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2012-02811|C9710|CDR0000067126|CALGB-C9710|U10CA031946,1999-06,2006-11,,2003-01-27,,2013-06-05,"Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Chicago, Illinois, 60606, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27157, United States",
