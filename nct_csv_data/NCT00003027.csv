NCT00003027,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Interleukin-2 and Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003027,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus interleukin-2 and interferon alfa is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone for metastatic melanoma.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare combination chemotherapy with or without interleukin-2 and interferon alfa in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma that cannot be treated by surgery.",NO,Melanoma (Skin),BIOLOGICAL: aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|BIOLOGICAL: recombinant interferon alfa|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: dacarbazine|DRUG: vinblastine,Overall survival,Response rate (complete and partial response)|Durable complete response rate|Response duration,,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|SWOG Cancer Research Network|Cancer and Leukemia Group B,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,482,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000065617|E3695|CLB-509802|SWOG-E3695,1997-11-13,2007-07,,2003-01-27,,2023-06-22,"MBCCOP - Gulf Coast, Mobile, Alabama, 36688, United States|CCOP - Greater Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006-2726, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Phoenix (Carl T.
