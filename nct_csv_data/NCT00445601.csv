NCT00445601,"S0337, Gemcitabine After Surgery in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Bladder Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00445601,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving gemcitabine directly into the bladder after surgery may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving gemcitabine directly into the bladder is more effective than a placebo in treating bladder cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine to see how well it works when given directly into the bladder compared with a placebo after surgery in treating patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent bladder cancer.",YES,Bladder Cancer,DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|OTHER: placebo,"Disease Recurrence Rate, Percentage of patients who experienced a recurrence of grade 1 or 2 superficial transitional cell cancer of the bladder between the date of registration and 24 months. Disease recurrence considered to occur at date of first observation of recurrent disease subsequently confirmed by biopsy. Patients without recurrence were censored at the time of their last cystoscopy., Up to 2 Years","Rate of Progression to Muscle Invasive Disease at 4 Years, From date of registration to date of diagnosis of progressive disease. Censor at date of last disease assessment for those without progression., 4 years|Compare Qualitative and Quantitative Toxicities Between the Treatment Arms, Number of patients with Grade 3 through Grade 5 adverse events that are related to study drug, Up to 4 years after Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT)|Rate of Disease Worsening Over 2 Years, Compare whether treatment with post-TURBT intravesical instillation of gemcitabine vs placebo results in reduced long-term morbidity in patients, as defined by requirement for fewer TURBTs, courses of traditional intravesical therapies, and surveillance cystoscopies over 4 years., Up to 2 years",,SWOG Cancer Research Network,National Cancer Institute (NCI),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,406,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CDR0000534235|S0337|U10CA032102,2007-09,2017-06,2017-06,2007-03-09,2018-04-24,2020-01-18,"Arkansas Cancer Research Center at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|University of California Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center at UC Health Sciences Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Urology Center of Colorado, Denver, Colorado, 80211, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Denver, Denver, Colorado, 80220, United States|St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, Lewiston, Idaho, 83501, United States|Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center at Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, 60153, United States|St. Rose Ambulatory and Surgery Center, Great Bend, Kansas, 67530, United States|Hays Medical Center, Hays, Kansas, 67601, United States|Hutchinson Hospital Corporation, Hutchinson, Kansas, 67502, United States|Kansas City Cancer Centers - West, Kansas City, Kansas, 66112, United States|Kansas Masonic Cancer Research Institute at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160-7357, United States|Kansas City Cancer Centers - Southwest, Overland Park, Kansas, 66210, United States|Mount Carmel Regional Cancer Center, Pittsburg, Kansas, 66762, United States|Tammy Walker Cancer Center at Salina Regional Health Center, Salina, Kansas, 67401, United States|Kansas City Cancer Center - Shawnee Mission, Shawnee Mission, Kansas, 66204, United States|St. Francis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Topeka, Kansas, 66606, United States|Feist-Weiller Cancer Center at Louisiana State University Health Sciences, Shreveport, Louisiana, 71130-3932, United States|University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109-0942, United States|Josephine Ford Cancer Center at Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|William Beaumont Hospital - Royal Oak Campus, Royal Oak, Michigan, 48073, United States|Truman Medical Center - Hospital Hill, Kansas City, Missouri, 64108, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, 64128, United States|Kansas City Cancer Centers - South, Kansas City, Missouri, 64131, United States|Kansas City Cancer Centers - North, Kansas City, Missouri, 64154, United States|Kansas City Cancer Centers - East, Lee's Summit, Missouri, 64064, United States|CCOP - Montana Cancer Consortium, Billings, Montana, 59101, United States|St. Vincent Healthcare Cancer Care Services, Billings, Montana, 59101, United States|Hematology-Oncology Centers of the Northern Rockies - Billings, Billings, Montana, 59102, United States|Billings Clinic - Downtown, Billings, Montana, 59107-7000, United States|Bozeman Deaconess Cancer Center, Bozeman, Montana, 59715, United States|St. James Healthcare Cancer Care, Butte, Montana, 59701, United States|Great Falls Clinic - Main Facility, Great Falls, Montana, 59405, United States|Sletten Cancer Institute at Benefis Healthcare, Great Falls, Montana, 59405, United States|Northern Montana Hospital, Havre, Montana, 59501, United States|St. Peter's Hospital, Helena, Montana, 59601, United States|Glacier Oncology, PLLC, Kalispell, Montana, 59901, United States|Kalispell Medical Oncology at KRMC, Kalispell, Montana, 59901, United States|Kalispell Regional Medical Center, Kalispell, Montana, 59901, United States|Montana Cancer Specialists at Montana Cancer Center, Missoula, Montana, 59807-7877, United States|Montana Cancer Center at St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center, Missoula, Montana, 59807, United States|James P.
