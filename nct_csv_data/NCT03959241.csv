All randomized patients will be followed for one year; however, the primary endpoint will be analyzed as a time to event endpoint. The primary analysis will be done using the randomized population. An event for this time to event outcome is defined as grade III-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring systemic immune suppression, disease relapse or progression, or death by any cause, whichever comes first. Time to event analyses were conducted. An unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis was done. Additionally, a multivariate Cox regression model adjusting for the following pre-specified covariates: age group (\< 65 vs. 65+), disease risk index (low, intermediate, high/very high), planned RIC conditioning regimen (Fludarabine/Busulfan, Fludarabine/Melphalan, Other), donor type/HLA matching score (related 6/6, unrelated 7/8, unrelated 8/8), and planned use of post-transplant maintenance therapy (Yes vs. no)., 1 year post randomization","Percentage of Participants With Grades II-IV and III-IV Acute GVHD at Day 100 Post-transplant, Acute GVHD was graded according to Mount Sinai aGVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) Criteria (Harris et al. 2016) with higher grade indicating worse outcomes. Grade I aGVHD is defined as Skin stage 1-2 and stage 0 for both GI and liver. Grade II is stage 3 skin, stage 1 GI, or stage 1 liver. Grade III is stage 2-3 GI or stage 2-3 liver. Grade IV is stage 4 skin or stage 4 liver. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV and III-IV at Day 100 was estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator with 95% confidence intervals, treating death prior to aGVHD as a competing event. The cumulative incidences of Minnesota standard and high risk aGVHD at Day 100 were determined with 95% confidence intervals. Time to aGVHD is defined as time from transplant until onset of grades II-IV and III-IV aGVHD, respectively. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to compare the treatment groups, with adjustment for same baseline characteristics as for the primary endpoint., Days 100 post-transplant|Participants With Maximum Acute GVHD at One Year Post-transplant, Acute GVHD were graded according to Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) Criteria (Harris et al. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation 2016; 22:4-10). The higher acute GVHD grade indicates worse outcomes. Grade 0 is no acute GVHD of any organ. Grade I acute GVHD is defined as Skin stage of 1-2 and stage 0 for both GI and liver organs. Grade II is stage 3 of skin, or stage 1 of GI, or stage 1 of liver. Grade III is stage 2-3 for GI, or stage 2-3 of liver. Grade IV is stage 4 of skin, or stage 4 of liver. Max acute GVHD by one-year post-transplant was computed., One year post-transplant|Participants With Maximum Stage of Skin, Lower GI, and Liver at Day 100 Post-transplant, Organ stages were graded according to Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) Criteria (Harris et al. 2016).

Higher stage in any organ indicates worse outcomes. For upper GI, stage 0 is no or intermittent nausea, vomiting, or anorexia; stage 1 is persistent nausea, vomiting, or anorexia. The maximum stages of Upper GI at patient level were summarized at Day 100., Day 100 post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Chronic GVHD Post-transplant, Percentage of participants with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) at one-year will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals for each treatment group using the cumulative incidence estimate with the complementary log-log transformation, treating death prior to cGVHD as a competing event. Chronic GVHD is based on NIH Consensus Criteria (2014 NIH Consensus Criteria) and includes mild, moderate and severe chronic GVHD. Eight organs were scored on a 0-3 scale to reflect degree of cGVHD involvement. Liver and pulmonary function test results and use of systemic therapy for treatment of cGVHD were also recorded. Assessment of cGVHD occurred up to one-year post-transplant. This endpoint considers any cGVHD onset. A multivariate Cox regression model for the cause-specific hazard of cGVHD was used to compare the treatment groups, after adjustment for baseline characteristics as described for the primary endpoint., 6, 12 months post-transplant|Number of Participants Experiencing Chronic GVHD With Maximum Severity at 12 Months Post-transplant, Chronic GVHD data were collected directly from providers and chart review as defined by the NIH Consensus Conference Criteria.

The first of the three days will be designated the day of neutrophil recovery. The competing event is death without neutrophil recovery. For participants who never drop ANC below 500/mm\^3, the date of neutrophil recovery will be Day +1 post-transplant. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery by Day 28 and Day 100 was described for each treatment group with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals using the complementary log-log transformation and treating death as a competing event., Days 28 and day 100 post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Platelet Recovery Post-transplant, Platelet recovery is defined by two different metrics: the first day of a sustained platelet count greater than or equal to 20,000/mm\^3 or greater than or equal to 50,000/mm\^3 with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first day of sustained platelet count above these thresholds will be designated the day of platelet engraftment. For participants who never drop their platelet count below 20,000/mm\^3 or 50,000/mm\^3, the date of platelet recovery will be Day +1 post HCT. The competing event is death without platelet recovery. The cumulative incidence estimate of platelet recovery by Day 60 and Day 100 were described by treatment group with 95% confidence intervals (complementary log-log transformation), treating death as a competing event., Day 60 and Day 100 post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Lymphocyte Recovery Post-transplant, Lymphocyte recovery is defined as the first day of sustained absolute lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 1000/mm\^3.
