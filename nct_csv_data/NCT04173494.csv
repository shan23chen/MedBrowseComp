NCT04173494,A Study of Momelotinib Versus Danazol in Symptomatic and Anemic Myelofibrosis Participants (MOMENTUM),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04173494,,COMPLETED,"MOMENTUM is a randomized, double-blind, active control Phase 3 trial intended to confirm the differentiated clinical benefits of the investigational drug momelotinib (MMB) versus danazol (DAN) in symptomatic and anemic participants who have previously received an approved Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) therapy for myelofibrosis (MF). The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of MMB to DAN in treating and reducing: 1) disease related symptoms, 2) the need for blood transfusions and 3) splenomegaly, in adults with primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The study is planned in countries including, but not limited to: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US).

Participants must be symptomatic with a Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) version (v) 4.0 Total Symptom Score of \>= 10 at screening, and be anemic with hemoglobin (Hgb) \< 10 gram/deciliter (g/dL). For participants with ongoing JAKi therapy at screening, JAKi therapy must be tapered over a period of at least 1 week, followed by a 2-week non-treatment washout interval prior to randomization.

Participants will be randomized 2:1 to orally self-administer blinded treatment: MMB plus placebo or DAN plus placebo. Participants randomized to receive MMB who complete the randomized treatment period to the end of Week 24 may continue to receive MMB in the open-label extended treatment period to the end of Week 204 (a total period of treatment of approximately 4 years) if the participants tolerates and continues to benefit from MMB.

Participants randomized to receive DAN may cross-over to MMB open-label treatment in the following circumstances: at the end of Week 24 if they complete the randomized treatment period; or at the end of Week 24 if they discontinue treatment with DAN but continue study assessments and do not receive prohibited medications including alternative active anti-MF therapy; or at any time during the randomized treatment period if they meet the protocol-defined criteria for radiographically confirmed symptomatic splenic progression. Participants randomized to receive DAN who are receiving clinical benefit at the end of Week 24 may choose to continue DAN therapy up to Week 48. The comparator treatment, DAN, is an approved medication in the US and in some other countries and is recommended by national guidelines as a treatment for anemia in MF.",YES,Primary Myelofibrosis|Post-polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis|Post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis,DRUG: Momelotinib|DRUG: Placebo to match danazol|DRUG: Danazol|DRUG: Placebo to match momelotinib,"Total Symptom Score (TSS) Response Rate at Week 24, Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) TSS version (v) 4.0 response rate was defined as percentage of participants with a \>= 50 percent (%) reduction from Baseline in mean MFSAF TSS over consecutive 28-day period immediately before end of Week 24. TSS response rate was measured using MFSAF v4.0. MFSAF v4.0 comprises 7 domains representing 7 most relevant symptoms of myelofibrosis (MF) identified through existing participant and clinician-based evidence: fatigue,night sweats,pruritus,abdominal discomfort,pain under left ribs,early satietyand bone pain. Participants scored each symptom domain using an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0(absent) to 10(worst imaginable). The MFSAF TSS was calculated as sum of scores of 7 domains for a possible range of scores of 0 to 70, with a higher TSS corresponding to more severe symptoms. A reduction from Baseline corresponded to a lessening of MF symptoms. Baseline was the last assessment done before or on the day of first dose date., Baseline and Week 24","Percentage of Participants With Transfusion Independence (TI) at Week 24, TI status was defined as not receiving red blood cell (RBC) or whole blood transfusion for \>=12 weeks, with no hemoglobin (Hgb) level \< 8 grams per deciliter (g/dL) during the same interval.

An increase in score from Baseline indicated a worsening of fatigue and a decrease in score from Baseline indicated an improvement in fatigue. Baseline was the last assessment done before or on the day of first dose date. Change from Baseline was defined as the post-Baseline value minus Baseline value., Baseline and Week 24|Change From Baseline in Cancer-related Fatigue as Assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) at Week 24, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is comprised of 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, cognitive), eight single item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea), as well as sub-scales assessing global health/quality of life and financial impact. Most items use a 4-point Likert scale from ""not at all"" to ""very much"" and a one-week recall period with the exception of the final two items which use a 7 point scale response from ""very poor"" to ""excellent"". Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better functioning/quality of life. An increase in scores from Baseline indicated an improved functioning/quality of life, and a decrease in scores from Baseline indicated a worsened functioning/quality of life. Baseline was the last assessment done before or on the day of first dose date.

PROMIS short form assesses self-reported capability of a participant rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes functioning of one's upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back) as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running errands. Participants scored each response on a scale from 1 (unable to do) to 5 (without any difficulty, or not at all). Total possible range of scores was 14 to 70, with higher scores corresponding to a greater physical function ability. An increase in score from Baseline indicated an improvement in physical function ability and a decrease in score from Baseline indicated a reduction in physical function ability. Baseline was last assessment done before or on the day of first dose date.
