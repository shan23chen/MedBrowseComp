NCT00984282,Nexavar® Versus Placebo in Locally Advanced/Metastatic RAI-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00984282,,COMPLETED,Trial of sorafenib versus placebo in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer refractory to radioiodine,YES,Thyroid Neoplasms,"DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)|DRUG: Placebo","Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on Central Assessment Incl. Clinical Progression Due to Bone Irradiation, PFS=time from randomization to first observed disease progression (radiological according to central assessment or clinical due to bone irradiation, whichever is earlier), or death due to any cause, if death occurred before progression. Progression was assessed by RECIST criteria, version 1.0, modified for bone lesions. PFS for participants without disease progression or death at the time of analysis or unblinding were censored at the last date of tumor assessment before unblinding. Participants with no tumor evaluation after baseline were censored at Day 1. PD (Progression Disease)=At least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameters (LD) of measured lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD on study since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. New lesions also constituted PD. In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression of a nonmeasured lesion may have been accepted as evidence of disease progression in participants with measurable disease., Final analysis to be performed when approximately 267 progression-free survival events (centrally assessed) had occurred, study duration approximately three years","Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time (days) from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their date of last contact. Since the median value could not be estimated due to censored data, the percentage of participants who died is presented., From randomization of the first subject until the database cut-off (30 AUG 2017), study duration approximately eight years|Time to Progression (TTP) Based on Central Assessment Incl. Clinical Progression Due to Bone Irradiation, Time to progression was defined at the time (days) from randomization to progression (based on central assessment \[radiological and clinical progression due to bone irradiation\]), From randomization of the first subject until the database cut-off (31 Aug 2012), study duration approximately three years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on Central Assessment, Disease control rate was defined as the proportion of subjects whose best response was complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, CR and PR were to be confirmed by another scan at least 4 weeks later; SD had to be documented at least 4 weeks after date of randomization. CR = Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and no-target). PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum. SD = steady state of disease which is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., From randomization of the first subject until the database cut-off (31 Aug 2012), study duration approximately three years|Response Rate Based on Central Assessment, Response rate was defined as the proportion of subjects whose best response was CR or PR. Per RECIST, CR and PR was to be confirmed by another scan at least 4 weeks later. CR = Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and no-target). PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum., From randomization of the first subject until the database cut-off (31 Aug 2012), study duration approximately three years|Duration of Response (DOR) Based on Central Assessment, Duration of response was defined as the time from the first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever was noted earlier, to disease progression or death (if death occurred before progression was documented). CR = Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and no-target). PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum., From randomization of the first subject until the database cut-off (31 Aug 2012), study duration approximately three years|Maximum Percent Reduction in Target Lesion Size Based on Central Assessment, The magnitude of change from baseline in target lesion size in evaluable participants with scans was determined., From randomization of the first subject until the database cut-off (31 Aug 2012), study duration approximately three years|AUC(0-12h),ss (Area Under the Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 to 12 Hours at Steady State), Sorafenib AUC(0-12h),ss (area under the concentration time curve from time 0 to 12 hours at steady state) was estimated from the steady state plasma concentration., A single pharmacokinetic plasma sample was collected at steady state (after 14 days of uninterrupted, unmodified sorafenib dosing)",,Bayer,Amgen,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,417,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",14295|2009-012007-25,2009-10-15,2012-08-31,2017-08-30,2009-09-25,2013-12-10,2018-09-13,"Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|Stanford, California, 94305-5820, United States|New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, United States|Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, 02118, United States|Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States|Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87106, United States|New York, New York, 10029, United States|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213-1863, United States|Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Seattle, Washington, 98109-1023, United States|Wien, 1090, Austria|Bruxelles - Brussel, 1000, Belgium|Sofia, 1527, Bulgaria|Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China|Beijing, 100021, China|Beijing, 100730, China|Chengdu, 610041, China|Hangzhou, 310022, China|Shanghai, 200030, China|Shanghai, 200127, China|Tianjin, 300060, China|Odense C, 5000, Denmark|Angers, 49933, France|Bordeaux, 33076, France|Caen, 14076, France|LILLE cedex, 59037, France|Lyon, 69373, France|MARSEILLE cedex, 13273, France|Paris, 75651, France|Villejuif, 94805, France|Erlangen, Bayern, 91054, Germany|München, Bayern, 81377, Germany|Würzburg, Bayern, 97080, Germany|Essen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, 45122, Germany|Köln, Nordrhein-Westfalen, 50924, Germany|Leipzig, Sachsen, 04103, Germany|Napoli, Campania, 80131, Italy|Genova, Liguria, 16132, Italy|Milano, Lombardia, 20122, Italy|Milano, Lombardia, 20133, Italy|Milano, Lombardia, 20162, Italy|Catania, Sicilia, 95029, Italy|Pisa, Toscana, 56124, Italy|Siena, Toscana, 53100, Italy|Perugia, Umbria, 06126, Italy|Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8681, Japan|Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8560, Japan|Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8577, Japan|Koto-ku, Tokyo, 135-8550, Japan|Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Seoul Teugbyeolsi, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|Daejeon, 301-721, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 110-744, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 120-752, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 135-710, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 137-701, Korea, Republic of|Groningen, 9713 GZ, Netherlands|Leiden, 2333 ZA, Netherlands|Gliwice, 44-101, Poland|Poznan, 60-355, Poland|Warszawa, 02-781, Poland|Warszawa, 04-141, Poland|Obninsk, 249036, Russian Federation|Riyadh, 11211, Saudi Arabia|Majadahonda, Madrid, 28222, Spain|Barcelona, 08035, Spain|Göteborg, 413 45, Sweden|Linköping, 581 85, Sweden|Lund, 221 85, Sweden|Stockholm, 171 76, Sweden|Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, AB25 2ZN, United Kingdom|Cardiff, CF14 2TL, United Kingdom|Glasgow, G12 0YN, United Kingdom|Leeds, LS9 7TF, United Kingdom|London, SE1 9RT, United Kingdom|London, SM2 5PT, United Kingdom|Manchester, M20 4BX, United Kingdom|Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, United Kingdom|Sutton, SM2 5PT, United Kingdom",
