The lung cancer module incorporated one multi-item scale to assess dyspnea and 9 single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. All of the domain scores ranged from 0 to 100. A high score indicated a high level of symptoms.

Time to definitive symptom deterioration for the composite endpoint was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date when the patient's score showed a 10 point or higher increase from baseline in any of the symptoms (pain, cough or dyspnea) as per EORTC QLQ-LC13 (with no later change below this threshold i.e., \<10 points was observed or if this increase was observed at the last assessment for the patient) or death due to any cause., Screening, treatment phase (Cycles 2, 3 then every 2nd cycle until Month 33; after Month 33, every 9 or 12 weeks, end of treatment); follow-up phase (Every 6 weeks until Month 33; after Month 33 every 9 or 12 weeks) up to approximately 120 months|Time to Definitive Deterioration in the Composite Endpoint of Pain, Cough or Dyspnea in the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), The LCSS patient scale used a 24-hour recall period and contained nine items: six measuring major symptoms for lung cancer (appetite loss, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, pain), and three summary items related to total symptom distress, normal activity status, and overall quality of life. The LCSS used a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) to measure the intensity of patient responses, with zero corresponding to the lowest rating (best status) and 100 representing the highest rating (worst status).

Time to definitive deterioration for the composite endpoint was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date when the patient's score showed a 10 point or higher increase from baseline in any of the LCSS scores related to pain in the chest, cough, or dyspnea (with no later change below this threshold i.e., \<10 points was observed or if this increase was observed at the last assessment for the patient) or death due to any cause., Screening, treatment phase (Cycles 2, 3 then every 2nd cycle until Month 33; after Month 33, every 9 or 12 weeks, end of treatment); follow-up phase (Every 6 weeks until Month 33; after Month 33 every 9 or 12 weeks) up to approximately 120 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the EORTC-QLQ C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 contained 30 items and was of both multi-item scales and single-item measures, including 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) scale. Items were assessed on a 4- or 7-level Likert scale, ranging from 1=""very poor"" to 7= ""excellent"" for GHS items and 1= ""not at all"" to 4= ""very much"" for all other items. The scores of the scales were averaged from the scores of the component items, transformed, and analyzed on a 0 - 100 scale. A high score represented a higher response level. The scores were analyzed using repeated measurement model for longitudinal data, including terms for visit, treatment, treatment by time interaction, strata and baseline score. Overall mean and standard error were obtained, Screening, treatment phase (Cycles 2, 3 then every 2nd cycle until Month 33; after Month 33, every 9 or 12 weeks, end of treatment); follow-up phase (Every 6 weeks until Month 33; after Month 33 every 9 or 12 weeks) up to approximately 120 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the EORTC QLQ- LC13, The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and provided information on an additional 13 items specifically related to lung cancer. The lung cancer module incorporated one multi-item scale to assess dyspnea, and 9 single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. Items were scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1=""not at all"" to 4=""very much"". For the multi-item scale, the scores were averaged from the scores of the component items, transformed, and then analyzed on a 0 - 100 scale. For the single item scale, raw scores were transformed and analyzed on a 0-100 scale. A high score indicated a high level of symptoms The scores were analyzed using repeated measurement model for longitudinal data, including terms for visit, treatment, treatment by time interaction, strata and baseline score. Overall mean and standard error were obtained., Screening, treatment phase (Cycles 2, 3 then every 2nd cycle until Month 33; after Month 33, every 9 or 12 weeks, end of treatment); follow-up phase (Every 6 weeks until Month 33; after Month 33 every 9 or 12 weeks) up to approximately 120 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), The LCSS consisted of 9 individual items; 6 measured lung cancer symptoms (appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain); the remaining 3 items measured general lung cancer symptom distress, interference with daily activities and overall QoL. Each item was scored on a 100-millimeter Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with scores ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = best outcome).

Total score was calculated as the average of the aggregate score of all 9 items. Scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher total scores indicating a greater overall impact of symptoms on the patient's QoL. The Symptom Burden Index (SBI) was calculated as the average of the six symptom items. It also ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater symptom burden.

Scores were analyzed using repeated measurement model for longitudinal data, including terms for visit, treatment, treatment by time interaction, strata and baseline score. Overall mean and standard error were obtained., Screening, treatment phase (Cycles 2, 3 then every 2nd cycle until Month 33; after Month 33, every 9 or 12 weeks, end of treatment); follow-up phase (Every 6 weeks until Month 33; after Month 33 every 9 or 12 weeks) up to approximately 120 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the EQ-5D-5L Index, The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system provides a profile of the participant's health state in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). For each of these dimensions, the participant self-assigned a score: from 1 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems). The 5 digit health states obtained for each dimension was converted into a single mean index value based on the EQ-5D crosswalk value set for the UK using the time trade-off method. This index ranges from -0.594 (worst health) to 1.0 (best health).

The scores were analyzed using repeated measurement model for longitudinal data, including terms for visit, treatment, treatment by time interaction, strata and baseline score. Overall mean and standard error were obtained., Screening, treatment phase (Cycles 2, 3 then every 2nd cycle until Month 33; after Month 33, every 9 or 12 weeks, end of treatment); follow-up phase (Every 6 weeks until Month 33; after Month 33 every 9 or 12 weeks) up to approximately 120 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue Score (VAS), The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a standardized measure of health status. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of the 5 following dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Along with the five dimensions of health, the EQ-5D-5L includes a VAS where respondents rate their overall health status on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst possible health state and 100 represents the best possible health state. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.

The scores were analyzed using repeated measurement model for longitudinal data, including terms for visit, treatment, treatment by time interaction, strata and baseline score. Overall mean and standard error were obtained., Screening, treatment phase (Cycles 2, 3 then every 2nd cycle until Month 33; after Month 33, every 9 or 12 weeks, end of treatment); follow-up phase (Every 6 weeks until Month 33; after Month 33 every 9 or 12 weeks) up to approximately 120 months|Cmax of LDK378, The observed maximum plasma concentration following administration, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose.
