A sample was considered positive for anti-emicizumab antibodies if the test result reached or exceeded a pre-determined threshold. 'Total ADA Positive' is the sum of all subjects who tested positive for ADA in the 2 following categories: 'ADA Positive (Treatment Boosted)', those who are pre-dose ADA positive and have a ≥4-fold increase in post-dose ADA levels compared to baseline measurement; and 'ADA Positive (Treatment Induced)', those who are pre-dose ADA negative or missing data and who have at least one post-dose ADA positive sample., From Baseline to discontinuation from study (median [min-max] observation period for all emicizumab participants: 262.3 [14.4-288.3] weeks)|Percentage of Participants With De Novo Development of Factor VIII (FVIII) Inhibitors, Levels of anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors) were analyzed using a validated FVIII activity assay. A participant was considered to have developed de novo FVIII inhibitors if the inhibitor levels detected in a post-baseline sample reached or exceeded a pre-determined threshold., From Baseline to discontinuation from study (median [min-max] observation period for all emicizumab participants: 262.3 [14.4-288.3] weeks)|Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of Emicizumab, Trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab were analyzed using a validated Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
