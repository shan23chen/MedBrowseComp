NCT01029262,A Study of Lenalidomide Versus Placebo in Subjects With Transfusion Dependent Anemia in Lower Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Without Del 5q,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01029262,MDS-005,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lenalidomide would reduce the number of red blood cell transfusions (RBC) needed in anemic (RBC transfusion-dependent) participants with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS without a deletion 5q chromosome abnormality. The study also investigated the safety of lenalidomide use in these participants. Two-thirds of the participants received oral lenalidomide and one-third of the participants received oral placebo.,YES,Anemia,DRUG: Lenalidomide|OTHER: Placebo,"Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Independence for ≥ 56 Days as Determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), The percentage of participants who achieved the 56-day RBC transfusion independent (TI) response was defined as the absence of any RBC transfusions during any consecutive ""rolling"" 56-day interval within the double-blind treatment phase (ie, Days 2 (Day 1 is the first study drug day) to 57, Days 3 to 58, etcetera). The double-blind treatment phase was defined as the period between the 1st dosing up until 28 days after the last study drug dose, From first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose, as of the data cut-off date of 17 March 2014; median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 168 (14, 449) and 164 (7, 1158) days in each treatment group respectively.|Percentage of Participants With a Erythroid Gene Signature Who Achieved RBC Transfusion Independence for ≥ 56 Days as Determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), The percentage of participants who achieved the 56-day RBC TI response was defined as the absence of any RBC transfusions during any consecutive ""rolling"" 56-day interval within the double-blind treatment phase (ie, Days 2 (Day 1 is the first study drug day) to 57, Days 3 to 58, etcetera). A participant who achieved at least a 56-day RBC-transfusion-independent response was considered a 56-day RBC-TI responder., From first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose, as of the data cut-off date of 17 March 2014; median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 168 (14, 449) and 164 (7, 1158) days in each treatment group respectively.","Percentage of Participants Who Achieved RBC Transfusion Independence With a Duration of ≥ 24 Weeks (168 Days) as Determined by the Sponsor, The 168-day RBC-transfusion-independent response was defined as the absence of any RBC transfusion during any consecutive ""rolling"" 168 days during the treatment period, for example Days 2 (Day 1 is the first study drug day) to 169, Days 3 to 170, Days 4 to 171, etcetera. A responder was defined as a participant who had a ≥ 168 consecutive days of RBC-transfusion-free period after the first dose of study drug in the treatment phase., From first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose, as of the data cut-off date of 17 March 2014; median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 168 (14, 449) and 164 (7, 1158) days in each treatment group respectively.|Kaplan Meier Estimates of Duration of 56-day RBC Transfusion Independence Response as Determined by the Sponsor, The duration of the first 56-day RBC transfusion-independence response was calculated for those who achieved a response and was dependent on whether a subsequent RBC transfusion was given after the transfusion-free period (response):

* For those who received a subsequent RBC transfusion after the response starts, the duration of response was not censored, and was calculated as response duration = last day of response - first day of response +1 where the last day of response was defined as 1 day before the first RBC transfusion which was given at 56 days or more after the response starts.
* For those who did not receive a subsequent RBC transfusion after the response started, the end day of the response was censored and duration of the response was calculated as response duration = date of last RBC transfusion assessment - first day of response+ 1. A responder was a participant who had a ≥ 56 consecutive days of RBC-transfusion-free period after the first study drug treatment period, Response was assessed up to the end of treatment; up to the data cut-off date of 17 Mar 2014.|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Erythroid Response Based on the Modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 Criteria, A participant was considered as having achieved an erythroid response if the participant either:

- had a hemoglobin (Hgb) increase ≥1.5 g/dL compared to baseline and confirmed by another central laboratory hemoglobin value at 4 to 8 weeks after the first Hgb measurement that also increased ≥1.5 g/dL. All Hgb values during this time interval must have had a ≥ 1.5 g/dL increase (ie, no central laboratory Hgb increase during this timeframe could be less \<1.5 g/dL) OR - had a 50% reduction in the number of the RBC transfusion units over any consecutive 56 days period compared to the baseline transfusion burden.

The baseline transfusion burden is the number of units over 112 days by the randomization divided by 2. Only transfusions given for a pre-transfusion Hgb value of 9 g/dL or less were used in this response assessment., From first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose, as of the data cut-off date of 17 March 2014; median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 168 (14, 449) and 164 (7, 1158) days in each treatment group respectively.|Time to 56-Day RBC-Transfusion-Independent (TI) Response as Determined by the Sponsor, The time to the first 56-day RBC-transfusion-independent response was calculated for participants who achieved a response. The day from the first dose of study drug to the date at which RBC-transfusion-independence starts was achieved and calculated using: Start date of the first response period - the date of the first study drug +1. A responder was defined as a participant who had a ≥ 56 consecutive days of RBC-transfusion-free period after the first dose of study drug in the treatment phase., From first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study drug, as of the data cut-off date of 17 March 2014; median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 168 (14, 449) and 164 (7, 1158) days in each treatment group respectively.|Kaplan Meier Estimates for Progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Progression to AML is part of the natural course of MDS and is a manifestation of disease progression. The time to progress to AML was calculated from the day of randomization to the first day when AML was diagnosed. Participants who died without AML were censored at the date of death. The participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last known day when participants did not have AML. Participants who did not progress to AML at the last follow-up contact were censored at the day of the last follow-up contact., From randomization to final data cut-off date of 03 Jul 2018; median follow up time for progression to AML was 2.3 years (range = 0 to 5.0 years) in the placebo arm and 2.6 years (range = 0 to 6.4 years) in the lenalidomide arm.|Kaplan Meier Estimate for Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was assessed using the time between randomization and the date of death or date of censoring. Participants who were alive at a data cutoff date and participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date when participants were known to be alive., From randomization to final data cut-off date of 03 July 2018; maximum survival follow up was 6.4 years|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:

* Death;
* Life-threatening event;
* Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
* Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
* Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
* Any other important medical event

The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 3.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death., From the first dose of study drug through 28 days after discontinuation from the study treatment; up to the final data cut-off date of 03 July 2018; maximum exposure was 2100 days in the lenalidomide arm and 529 days in the placebo arm.|Compliance Rates Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) From Baseline to Week 48, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire.
