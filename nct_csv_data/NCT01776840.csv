NCT01776840,A Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib Given in Combination With Bendamustine and Rituximab in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01776840,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib given in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in patients 65 years of age or older with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.,YES,Mantle Cell Lymphoma,DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval between the date of randomization to the date of disease progression (PD) or relapse from complete response (CR) or death, whichever is first reported. Disease assessments were based on the 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. PD is defined as any new lesion or increase by 50 percent (%) of previously involved sites from nadir (PD criteria: Appearance of new nodal lesion 1.5 centimeters \[cm\] in any axis, 50% increase in sum of product of diameters \[SPD\] of greater than \[\>\] 1 node or 50% increase in longest diameter of previously identified node 1 cm in short axis)., Up to 97 months","Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death., Up to 97 months|Complete Response Rate, Complete response (CR) rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR (based on investigator assessment) on or prior to the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. Criteria for CR: disappearance of all evidence of disease; mass of any size permitted if positron emission tomography (PET) negative; regression to normal size on computed tomography (CT); spleen and liver: not palpable, nodules disappeared; bone marrow: infiltrate cleared on repeat biopsy., Up to 97 months|Time-to-Next Treatment, Time-to-next treatment was measured from the date of randomization to the start date of any anti-mantle cell lymphoma (anti-MCL) treatment subsequent to the study treatment., Up to 97 months|Percentage of Participants With Overall Response, Percentage of participants with overall response that is participants who achieved CR or PR was reported. Criteria for CR: disappearance of all evidence of disease; mass of any size permitted if PET negative; regression to normal size on CT; spleen and liver: not palpable, nodules disappeared; bone marrow: infiltrate cleared on repeat biopsy. Criteria for PR: greater than or equal to (\>=) 50% decrease in sum of the diameter of all target lesions compared with baseline, in absence of new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Up to 97 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Negative Response Rate, Minimal residual disease negative rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR with MRD-negative disease status (that is, \<5 mantle cell lymphoma \[MCL\] cell per 10,000 leukocytes for detection using the MRD assay), as assessed by flow cytometry of a bone marrow and/or peripheral blood sample., Up to 97 months|Time to Worsening (TTW) in the Lymphoma (Lym) Subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) Questionnaire, Time to worsening in the Lymphoma subscale of the FACT-Lym, defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the start date of worsening of participant symptoms. Worsening was defined by a 5-point decrease from baseline, death, or a missing assessment due to being ""too ill"", whichever occurred first. FACT-Lym Lymphoma subscale contains 15 questions, scores from 0 to 4 for each question (higher the worse). Lymphoma subscale score is the total of reverse scores, range 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life., Up to 97 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) was defined as the interval between the date of initial documentation of a response including PR and the date of first documented evidence of PD or death., Up to 97 months|Duration of Complete Response (DoCR), Duration of complete response (DoCR) was defined as the interval between the date of initial documentation of a CR and the date of first documented evidence of PD or death whichever occurs first, for participants who achieved CR., Up to 97 months|Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the date of initial documentation of a response., Up to 97 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Number of participants with TEAEs were reported. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as adverse events with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study treatment up to and including 30 days after date of last dose of study medication, or the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier., Up to 97 months|Oral Plasma Clearance (CL/F) of Ibrutinib, CL/F of Ibrutinib was determined using population pharmacokinetics (PopPK modeling)., Day 2 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (each cycle was of 28 days)|Oral Volume of Distribution at Steady State of Ibrutinib, Oral volume of distribution at steady state of ibrutinib was determined using PopPK modeling., Day 2 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (each cycle was of 28 days)|Area Under the Concentration Curve of Ibrutinib During 24 Hours After Dosing at Steady State, Area under the concentration curve of ibrutinib during 24 hours after dosing at steady state was determined using PopPK modeling., Day 2 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (each cycle was of 28 days)|Minimum Observed Plasma Concentration of Ibrutinib, Minimum observed plasma concentration of ibrutinib was determined using PopPK modeling., Day 2 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (each cycle was of 28 days)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of Ibrutinib, Maximum observed plasma concentration of ibrutinib was determined using PopPK modeling., Day 2 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (each cycle was of 28 days)",,"Janssen
