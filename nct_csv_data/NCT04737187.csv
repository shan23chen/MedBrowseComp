As per RECIST 1.1, CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters. PD: at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., From randomization to the date of first documented tumor progression, death due to any cause or data cut-off date whichever comes first (i.e., up to 20 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a medically important event. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed, worsened or became serious during the TEAE period (time from the first dose of study treatment up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment). TEAEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs., From baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (i.e., up to 30.7 months)|European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30): Time to Definitive Deterioration of >=10 Points in Sub-scale Scores - Kaplan-Meier Analysis, EORTC QLQ-C30: 30 item questionnaires with 5 multi-item functional subscales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social functioning), 3 multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), global health/quality of life (QOL) subscale and 6 single items assessing other cancer related symptoms (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite, diarrhea, constipation and financial impact of cancer).

Each dimension has a 5-level response: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Response options are measured with a 5-point Likert scale. The 5D-5L systems are converted into a single index utility score between 0 to 1, where higher score indicates a better health state and lower score indicate worse health state., Baseline, Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, Cycle 8, Cycle 9, Cycle 10, Cycle 11, Cycle 12, Cycle 13 and Cycle 14|Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Working Group Health Status Measure 5 Dimensions, 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Score: Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) at Specified Timepoints, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status that provides a general assessment of health utility and consist of 2 sections; descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) and a VAS. The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 centimeter (cm) vertical VAS; the scale went from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).
