Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates was used for analysis., From randomization date up to a median follow-up: 47.2 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Blinded Central Assessments, DOR is defined only for participants who experience an objective response after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and is the time from the first objective response per Lugano classification to disease progression or death from any cause. Objective response is defined in outcome measure 2 and disease progression is defined in outcome measure 1. KM estimates were used for analysis., From the date of first confirmed objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death regardless of cause (Up to 37.8 months)|Modified Event Free Survival (mEFS) Per Blinded Central Assessment, Modified event free survival is defined the same way as EFS, except that a best response of SD up to and including Day 150 assessment post randomization was not considered an event. KM estimates were used for analysis., From randomization date up to a median follow-up: 24.9 months|Event Free Survival Per Investigator Disease Assessments, EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per the IWG Lugano Classification, best response of stable disease (SD) up to and including Day 150, commencement of new lymphoma therapy, or death from any cause. Disease progression is defined in outcome measure 1., From randomization date up to a median follow-up: 47.2 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Investigator Disease Assessments, PFS is defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of disease progression per Lugano classification or death from any cause. Disease progression is defined in outcome measure 1. KM estimates was used for analysis., From randomization date up to a median follow-up: 47.2 months|Modified Event Free Survival (mEFS) Per Investigator Assessment, Modified event free survival is defined the same way as EFS, except that a best response of SD up to and including Day 150 assessment post randomization was not considered an event. KM estimates were used for analysis., From randomization date up to a median follow-up: 47.2 months|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status Scores, Global health status was measured using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C-30. This health related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire was comprised of 15 questions on functional scales, 13 questions on symptom scales and 2 on global health status scale. Global Health Status used a 7 point Likert-type scale of 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent). All scores were transformed to 0-100. Higher scores for Global Health Status indicated better HRQoL., Baseline, Days 50, 100, and 150; Months 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24|Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of global health status/QoL scale; five functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social); three symptom domains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain); and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties).

The Physical Functioning domain includes 5 questions in which participants were asked to rate their overall health and overall quality of life as it relates to physical functioning during the past week on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The 5 scores were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, where a high score indicated better QoL. A positive change from baseline indicates better QoL., Baseline, Days 50, 100, 150, Months 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24|Changes From Baseline in the European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Five Levels Scale (EQ-5D-5L) Index Score, The Euro-QOL, Five Dimensions, Five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L comprises 2 components: a questionnaire covering 5 dimensions and a tariff of values based upon direct valuations of health states using a visual analog scale (VAS). The total score for EQ-5D-5L index- is presented on a range from 0 to 1 where higher scores indicate better outcome. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline, Days 50, 100, 150; Months 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24|Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L VAS Scale Score, The EQ-5D-5L VAS is a 20-cm VAS for recording self-rated current HRQoL state and is used to describe the participants' health status on the day of the assessment. The EQ-5D-5L VAS score is recorded by each participant for his or her current HRQoL state and scored 0 (""the worst health you can imagine"") to 100 (""the best health you can imagine""). The value 100 indicates improvement., Baseline, Days 50, 100, 150; Months 9, 12, 18, 21 and 24|Number of Participants With Anti-Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Antibodies, From first dose of axicabtagene up to a median follow-up: 24 months|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, A TEAE is defined as any AE that begins on or after the first dose of study treatment (axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or SOC), excluding bridging therapy. Participant incidence rates of TEAEs, including all, serious, fatal, CTCAE Grade 3 or higher, and treatment related AEs reported will be tabulated by preferred term and system organ class coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)., Up to 5 years|Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Laboratory Values Reported as Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs, Grading categories were determined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.
