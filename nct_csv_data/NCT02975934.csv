Modified RECIST Version 1.1 criteria is used to determine ORR (ie, CR or PR by IRR assessment and no progression in bone per PCWG3 by IRR assessment).

CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
