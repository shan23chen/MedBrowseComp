NCT00843882,Lenalidomide With or Without Epoetin Alfa in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00843882,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide to see how well it works with or without epoetin alfa in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of myelodysplastic syndrome by blocking blood flow to the cells. Colony stimulating factors, such as epoetin alfa, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide is more effective with or without epoetin alfa in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia.",YES,Anemia|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|De Novo Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Myelodysplastic Syndrome,PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy|BIOLOGICAL: Epoetin Alfa|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Lenalidomide,"Proportion of Patients With Major Erythroid Response (MER), Major erythroid response is defined as transfusion-independence for ≥ 8 consecutive weeks for patients who were red blood cell transfusion-dependent at baseline AND a ≥ 1 g/dL hemoglobin rise compared to mean pre-transfusion baseline value; or a \> 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin without transfusion for non-transfusion dependent patients., Assessed after completion of 16 weeks of treatment","Time to Major Erythroid Response (MER), Time to major erythroid response (MER) is defined in responders as the time from randomization to the documented date of MER.

For transfusion independent patients, the date of MER is the first date of the elevation in hemoglobin level of more than 2 g/dL that has been sustained for at least 8 weeks. For transfusion dependent patients, the date of MER is the beginning date of the time interval of transfusion independence that has been sustained for at least eight weeks., Assessed every cycle during treatment and then 3 and 6 months after last protocol treatment|Duration of Major Erythroid Response (MER), Duration of major erythroid response (MER) is defined as the time interval between the documented date of MER and the earliest date of resumption of red blood cell transfusions ≥ 2 units in an 8-week period, a reduction in hemoglobin concentration ≥ 2 g/dL in the absence of acute infection, gastrointestinal bleeding and hemolysis, or death., Assessed every cycle during treatment and then 3 and 6 months after last protocol treatment|Proportion of Patients With Major Erythroid Response (MER) to Salvage Combination Therapy, Major erythroid response is defined as transfusion-independence for ≥ 8 consecutive weeks for patients who were red blood cell transfusion-dependent at baseline AND a ≥ 1 g/dL hemoglobin rise compared to mean pre-transfusion baseline value; or a \> 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin without transfusion for non-transfusion dependent patients., Assessed after completion of 16 weeks of treatment|Proportion of Patients With Minor Erythroid Response, The definition of minor erythroid response: the mean hemoglobin is sustained 1.0 to 2.0 g/dL above the baseline value for a minimum of 8 weeks; or a 50% or greater decrease in 8-week red blood cell transfusion requirements compared to baseline., Assessed every cycle during treatment and after completion of 16 weeks of treatment|Proportion of Patients With Major Erythroid Response (MER) Among Those With Chromosome 5q31.1 Deletion, Major erythroid response is defined as transfusion-independence for ≥ 8 consecutive weeks for patients who were red blood cell transfusion-dependent at baseline AND a ≥ 1 g/dL hemoglobin rise compared to mean pre-transfusion baseline value; or a \> 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin without transfusion for non-transfusion dependent patients., Assessed after completion of 16 weeks of treatment|Proportion of Patients With Bone Marrow Response, Bone marrow response includes complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR).

Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow showing \< 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines, with no evidence for dysplasia. When erythroid precursors constitute \< 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the percent of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are ≥ 50% erythroid cells, the percent blasts should be based on the non-erythroid cells.

Partial remission (PR): All of the CR criteria (if abnormal prior to treatment), except blasts decreased by 50% over pre-treatment, or a less advanced Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) World Health Organization (WHO) classification than pretreatment. Cellularity and morphology are not relevant., Assessed at 16 weeks|Proportion of Patients With Cytogenetic Response, Evaluation of cytogenetic response requires 20 analyzable metaphases when using conventional techniques. Analysis of data will require 20 metaphases before and after treatment, which must be done on bone marrow only (peripheral blood is not a substitute). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used as a supplement to follow a specifically defined cytogenetic abnormality, but it is not a substitute for conventional cytogenetic studies. Cytogenetic response is defined as follows: Complete response: Restoration of a normal karyotype in patients with a documented pre-existing clonal (\>2 metaphases abnormal) chromosome abnormalities.

Partial response: \> 50% reduction in the percentage of bone marrow metaphases with only clonal abnormality., Assessed at baseline and after completion of 16 weeks of treatment|Association Between Major Erythroid Response and Cytogenetic Response, Major erythroid response is defined as transfusion-independence for ≥ 8 consecutive weeks for patients who were red blood cell transfusion-dependent at baseline AND a ≥ 1 g/dL hemoglobin rise compared to mean pre-transfusion baseline value; or a \> 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin without transfusion for non-transfusion dependent patients.

Evaluation of cytogenetic response requires 20 analyzable metaphases before and after treatment, which must be done on bone marrow only. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used as a supplement to follow a specifically defined cytogenetic abnormality, but it is not a substitute for conventional cytogenetic studies. Cytogenetic response is defined as follows:

Complete response: Restoration of a normal karyotype in patients with a documented pre-existing clonal (\>2 metaphases abnormal) chromosome abnormalities.

Partial response: \> 50% reduction in the percentage of bone marrow metaphases with only clonal abnormality., Assessed at baseline and after completion of 16 weeks of treatment|Pretreatment Endogenous Erythropoietin Level, Pretreatment endogenous erythropoietin level was assessed at baseline. The association between pretreatment endogenous erythropoietin level and major erythroid response was evaluated among patients who received lenalidomide alone.

Major erythroid response is defined as transfusion-independence for ≥ 8 consecutive weeks for patients who were red blood cell transfusion-dependent at baseline AND a ≥ 1 g/dL hemoglobin rise compared to mean pre-transfusion baseline value; or a \> 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin without transfusion for non-transfusion dependent patients., Assessed at baseline and after completion of 16 weeks of treatment","The Association Between CD45 Isoform Profile and ex Vivo Augmentation of STAT5 Phosphorylation by Lenalidomide, To evaluate the effect of CD45 isoform profile on lenalidomide enhancement of erythropoietin-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in CD71Hi erythroid precursors and the relationship to erythroid response., Assessed at baseline and after completion of 16 weeks of treatment|RNA and Protein Expression Level of Cdc25C, PP2A and Their Phosphatase Substrates, Cdc2phospho-Tyr15 and Cdc25Cphospho-Ser216, To characterize molecular targets relevant to lenalidomide cytotoxicity in del5q31.1 cells., Assessed at baseline and after completion of 16 weeks of treatment|Proportion of Patients With Cryptic Chromosome 5q31.1 Deletions, To evaluate the frequency of cryptic chromosome 5q31.1 deletions in patients with non-del5q31.1 MDS by array based genomic scan, and to determine the relationship to hematologic response., Assessed at baseline and after completion of 16 weeks of treatment",National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,247,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2009-01173|NCI-2009-01173|CDR0000634119|ECOG-E2905|09-0095|E2905|E2905|E2905|U10CA021115|U10CA180820|U24CA196172,2009-01-29,2019-07-08,2025-10-02,2009-02-13,2021-07-08,2025-02-06,"University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Alaska Breast Care and Surgery LLC, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Alaska Women's Cancer Care, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Anchorage Oncology Centre, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Katmai Oncology Group, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, Fairbanks, Alaska, 99701, United States|Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Banner University Medical Center -
