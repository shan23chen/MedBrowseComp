Patients indicated their response on a scale of 0 to 4 on each statement, with 0 indicating worst score and 4 the best score. All individual scores were combined to calculate the total score. Total score was reported with score range: 0-148 which was calculated as the sum of all unweighted subscale scores. The higher the total score the better the result. Descriptive statistics and change from baseline were calculated in total score at each scheduled assessment time point., Baseline, Week 24|Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs): Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5D-5L UK Score, The EQ-5D descriptive classification consists of five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. Patients are requested to select the statement which best describes their condition on that day for each dimension. For overall health that day, the EuroQoL-5D-5L scale is numbered from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best health you can imagine and 0 being the worst health you can imagine. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum) were calculated based on the scored scales at each scheduled assessment time point. In order to measure Quality-of-Life (QoL) among aGvHD patients, and potential changes over time, change from baseline in EuroQol-5D-5L scores at the time of each assessment were also calculated.
