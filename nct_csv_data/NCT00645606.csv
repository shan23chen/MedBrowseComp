NCT00645606,Rituximab Maintenance Versus Observation After First-line Immunochemotherapy by FCR in Older Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00645606,LLC2007SA,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Classical chemotherapy does not cure advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) despite new drugs. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 surface antigen on B lymphocytes and leads to apoptosis of CD20 positive B lymphocytes. The highest response rate yet published in the treatment of first-line CLL has been obtained by the association of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Now, the question is whether this response can be improved, as some trials showed that eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) in CLL is associated with a longer treatment-free and overall survival. Maintenance therapy using rituximab has been recently approved as a means of prolonging remission in patients with indolent non Hodgkin's lymphoma. Maintenance therapy with rituximab could be of interest in treatment of MRD in CLL and prolonging remission and survival times.

PURPOSE: The overall purpose of the study is to determine the value of immunotherapy maintenance with single agent rituximab in comparison with no further treatment (observation ) for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in elderly (\>65 years) patients who respond to induction immunochemotherapy with FCR.",NO,Leukemia,BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab,"Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, relapse or death from any cause; using iwCLL criteria, randomization until disease progression or death","Event-free survival, Event-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of one of the following events, whichever occurs first: disease progression or relapse, death from any cause, initiation of any new anti-CLL therapy, and secondary malignancy, randomization until disease progression, death, new CLL treatment, and secondary cancer|Disease-free survival, Disease-free survival is defined as the time from first documented CR to relapse, first documented CR until relapse|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, randomization until death|Time to next treatment, Time to next treatment is defined as the time from randomization to initiation of a new CLL-related treatment, randomization until new CLL treatment|Overall response rate, Overall response rate is defined by the percentage of participants with an overall response; CR or PR according to NCI criteria and CR, CRi or PR according to iwCLL, baseline up to approximately 66 months|Phenotypic response rate, Phenotypic response rate is defined by the percentage of participants with minimal residual disease negativity as measured by six-colour flow cytometry with a sensitivity of 0.7 x 10-5.
