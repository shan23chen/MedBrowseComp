NCT00055731,Hormone Therapy With or Without Docetaxel And Estramustine in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That is Locally Advanced or At High Risk of Relapse,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00055731,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as nilutamide, bicalutamide, flutamide, or cyproterone may stop the adrenal glands from producing androgens. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether hormone therapy is more effective with or without chemotherapy in treating prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of hormone therapy with or without docetaxel and estramustine in treating patients who have prostate cancer that is locally advanced or at high risk of relapse.",NO,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: bicalutamide|DRUG: Goserelin Acetate|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: Estramustine phosphate sodium|DRUG: acetylsalicylic acid|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Progression-free survival, The progression-free survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 15 years.|Biological response: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, The biological response is defined as a non-detectable serum PSA level (\<0.1 ng/ml), 3 months|Cancer progression as measured by ultrasound, Defined as a decrease of at least 20% in prostate volume detected by ultrasound after the neo-adjuvant treatment, From randomization to disease progression, up to 15 years.|Clinical progression-free survival, The clinical progression-free survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse (based on bone scintigraphy, pelvic scan, or MRI evaluation)., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 15 years.|Overall survival, The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive. The outcome is to evaluate whether SRBT improves overall survival compared to standard of care., From randomization to death from any cause, up to 15 years.|Acute and late toxicity during the study, The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = ""mild"", 2 = ""moderate"", 3 = ""severe"", 4 = ""life-threatening"", and 5 = ""death"") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 15 years.|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., At baseline, 3 months, and 1 year",,,UNICANCER,Sanofi|AstraZeneca,MALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,413,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,GETUG-12 - UC-0160/0203|CDR0000270970|EU-20238,2002-11-14,2010-12-21,2022-12-31,2003-03-07,,2023-01-18,"Centre Paul Papin, Angers, 49100, France|Hopital Saint Andre, Bordeaux, 33075, France|Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, 33076, France|Hopital Ambroise Pare, Boulogne-Billancourt, F-92104, France|Centre Regional Francois Baclesse, Caen, 14076, France|Polyclinique du Parc, Cholet, 49300, France|Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Henri Mondor, Creteil, 94000, France|Clinique Sainte-Marguerite, Hyeres, 83400, France|Centre Hospitalier Departemental, La Roche Sur Yon, 85025, France|Centre Hospital Universitaire Hop Huriez, Lille, 59037, France|Centre Hospital Regional Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, 87042, France|Polyclinique des Quatre Pavillons, Lormont, 33310, France|Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, 69008, France|Marseille Institute of Cancer - Institut J.
