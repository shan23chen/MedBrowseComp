NCT02784171,Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02784171,,COMPLETED,Pembrolizumab is a new type of drug for mesothelioma (immunotherapy). Laboratory tests show that this drug works by helping improve the body's immune response to help fight cancer. Pembrolizumab may help the immune system to recognize cancer cells and slow down the growth and/or spreading of cancer.,YES,Mesothelioma,DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Pembrolizumab,"Phase II: Progression Free Survival Measured as Time From Randomization to First Observation of Objective Disease Relapse or Progression, PFS was calculated for all randomized patients from the day of randomization until the first observation of disease progression (date of objective relapse or progression of Relapse/Progression Report) or death due to any cause (recorded in Date/Cause of Death Section of Death Report)., PFS was monitored continuously, with assessments every 6 weeks for 3 visits, then every 12 weeks, 4 weeks post-discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and every 24 weeks until death, over an average of 16.2 months.|Phase III: Overall Survival Defined as Time From Randomization to the Date of Death From Any Cause, Overall survival was defined as time from the day of randomization to death for patients died. For patients still alive at time of data-cutoff for analysis, it was censored at the last day the patients were known alive as the last of all dates ., Survival was monitored continuously throughout the study and during follow-up. Patients were evaluated for each cycle, 4 weeks after discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and then every 24 weeks until death, an average of 16.2 months.","Phase III: Progression Free Survival Measured as Time From Randomization to First Observation of Objective Disease Relapse or Progression, PFS was calculated for all randomized patients from the day of randomization until the first observation of disease progression (date of objective relapse or progression of Relapse/Progression Report) or death due to any cause (recorded in Date/Cause of Death Section of Death Report). The primary analysis for PFS was based on the progression evaluated in this study using mesothelioma-modified RECIST (mRECIST) conducted by blinded independent review (BICR)., PFS was monitored continuously, with assessments every 6 weeks for 3 visits, then every 12 weeks, 4 weeks post-discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and every 24 weeks until death, over an average of 16.2 months.|Phase III: Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with best objective response being complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Response was monitored continuously, with assessments every 6 weeks for 3 visits, then every 12 weeks, 4 weeks post-discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and every 24 weeks until death, over an average of 16.2 months.",,Canadian Cancer Trials Group,"National Cancer Institute, Naples|Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC|Intergroupe Francophone de Cancerologie Thoracique",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,520,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,I227|2016-002286-60|IFCT-1901,2016-11-11,2024-10-11,2024-10-11,2016-05-26,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|BCCA - Cancer Centre for the Southern Interior, Kelowna, British Columbia, V1Y 5L3, Canada|BCCA - Fraser Valley Cancer Centre, Surrey, British Columbia, V3V 1Z2, Canada|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|Juravinski Cancer Centre at Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 5C2, Canada|London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, N6A 5W9, Canada|Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada|University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|CHUM-Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H2X 3E4, Canada|The Research Institute of the McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, H4A 3J1, Canada|University Institute of Cardiology and, Quebec City, Quebec, G1V 4G5, Canada|Allan Blair Cancer Centre, Regina, Saskatchewan, S4T 7T1, Canada|AP-HP Hopital Tenon, Paris, Cedex 20, 75970, France|Centre Alexis Vautrin, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, Cedex, 54500, France|CHU Dupuytren, Limoges, FR, 87042, France|Hopital du Scorff, Lorient, FR, 56100, France|Lyon URCOT, Pierre-benite, FR, 69310, France|CHU Rennes - Hopital Pontchaillou, Rennes, FR, 35033, France|Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, FR, 94805, France|CHRU de Tours - Hopital Bretonneau, Tours Cedex, Tours Cedex 9, 37044, France|CHU - Angers, Angers, 49033, France|Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon Cedex, 25030, France|Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, 33076, France|Boulogne - Ambroise Pare, Boulogne, 92104, France|Caen - CHU, Caen, 14000, France|Clermont-Ferrand - CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, 63003, France|Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil, 94000, France|Centre Hospitalier du Mans, Le Mans, 72037, France|Lille - Hopital Calmette, Lille, 59037, France|Marseille - Hopital Nord, Marseille, 13915, France|Montpellier 34298, CEDEX 5, France|Centre Hospitalier de Mulhouse, Mulhouse, 68070, France|Centre Rene Gauducheau, Nantes, 44805, France|Hopital Bichat, Paris, 75877, France|Nouvel Hopital Civil Hopitaux, Strasbourg, 67091, France|CHITS Toulon Sainte Musse, Toulon, 83056, France|Hopital Larrey, Toulouse, 31059, France|Oncologia SS Antonio e Biagio Alessandria, Alessandria, AL, 15121, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliera San Giuseppe Moscati, Avellino, AV, 83100, Italy|IRCCS Ospedale Oncologico Giovanni Paolo II, Bari, BA, 70124, Italy|Oncologia Medica Humanitas Gavazzeni Bergamo, Bergamo, BG, 24125, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliera Garibaldi Nesima, Catania, CT, 95123, Italy|Instituto Clinico Humanitas, Rozzano (MI), Lombardia, 20089, Italy|Oncologia Medica IRCCS Arcispedale Maria, Reggio Emilia, RE, 42123, Italy|Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri IFO Istituto, Rome, RM, 00144, Italy|PO A Perrino ASL Brindisi - UOC Oncologia Medica, Brindisi, 72100, Italy|AOU Policlinico Vittorio Emanuele UOC di Oncologia, Catania, 95125, Italy|U.O. di Oncologia Ospedale Villa Scassi, Genova, 16149, Italy|Intstituto Scientifico Romangnolo, Meldola, 47014, Italy|Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, 20133, Italy|U.O.C. di Oncologia U.L.S.S. 13, Mirano, 30035, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale, Napoli, 80131, Italy|Dott.
