NCT03106779,"Study of Efficacy of CML-CP Patients Treated With ABL001 Versus Bosutinib, Previously Treated With 2 or More TKIs",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03106779,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this pivotal study was to compare the efficacy of asciminib (ABL001) with that of bosutinib in the treatment of patients with CML-CP having previously been treated with a minimum of two prior ATP-binding site TKIs.

Patients intolerant to the most recent TKI therapy must have had BCR-ABL1 ratio \> 0.1% IS at screening and patients failing their most recent TKI therapy must have met the definition of treatment failure as per the 2013 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations.

Patients with documented treatment failure as per 2013 ELN recommendations while on bosutinib treatment had the option to switch to asciminib treatment within 96 weeks after the last patient has been randomized on study.",YES,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,DRUG: Asciminib|DRUG: Bosutinib,"Number of Participants With Major Molecular Response (MMR) Rate at 24 Weeks, MMR was defined as a ≥ 3.0 log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts compared to the standardized baseline equivalent to ≤ 0.1% BCR-ABL1/ABL% by IS as measured by RQ-PCR., 24 weeks","Number of Participants With Major Molecular Response (MMR) Rate, To compare additional parameters of the efficacy asciminib versus bosutinib, 96 weeks after the last patient received the first study dose|Complete Cytogenetic Response Rate, To compare additional parameters of the efficacy of asciminib versus bosutinib.
