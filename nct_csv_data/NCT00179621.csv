NCT00179621,Lenalidomide Versus Placebo in Myelodysplastic Syndromes With a Deletion 5q[31] Abnormality,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00179621,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study was to compare 2 doses (10 mg and 5 mg) of lenalidomide to that of placebo in subjects with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent low- or intermediate-1-risk IPSS MDS associated with a deletion (del) 5q\[31\] cytogenetic abnormality. Study participants were randomized to one of the two treatment groups or to placebo and took the study drug for 16 weeks. At this timepoint, participants were evaluated for erythroid response. If participants did not achieve at least a minor erythroid response, they were discontinued from the Double-Blind phase and entered into the Open-Label phase. All erythroid responders at Week 16 were to continue in the Double-Blind phase for up to 52 weeks. For participants that were still responding at the end of Double-Blind phase, they could then rollover into the Open-Label phase for an additional two years. Participants could remain on study for up to a total of 3 years. All participants who discontinued from the study were followed every 4 months for overall survival and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).",YES,Myelodysplastic Syndromes,DRUG: Lenalidomide 5 mg|DRUG: Lenalidomide 10 mg|DRUG: Placebo,"Participants Who Achieved Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Independence for >= 26 Weeks (182 Days), The count of study participants who had no RBC transfusions for 26 consecutive weeks or more during the double-blind period., Up to 52 weeks","Participants Who Achieved Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Independence for 56 Days, Count of study participants who had no RBC transfusions during any 56 or more consecutive study days during the double-blind period., Up to 52 weeks|Duration of Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Independence for Participants Who Became RBC Transfusion Independent for at Least 182 Days, Mean number of weeks that participants who achieved RBC transfusion independence for at least 182 days were able to maintain RBC transfusion independence. Both double-blind and open-label periods are included., up to 3 years|Maximum Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin During the Double-blind Period for Participants Who Became Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Independent for at Least 182 Days, For participants who became RBC transfusion independent for at least 182 days during the double-blind study period, the mean maximum change from baseline in hemoglobin is summarized., Baseline, up to 52 weeks|Participants' Response in Platelet Counts as Defined by the International MDS Working Group (IWG 2000) During Double-blind Period, The International MDS Working Group (IWG) defines a major platelet response for participants with a pre-treatment platelet count of \<100,000/mm\^3 as an absolute increase of ≥30,000/mm\^3 whereas a minor response is defined as a ≥50% increase in platelet count with a net increase greater than 10,000/mm\^3 but less than 30,000/mm\^3., up to 52 weeks|Participants' Response in Absolute Neutrophil Counts as Defined by the International MDS Working Group (IWG 2000) During Double-blind Period, A major neutrophil response is defined by the International MDS Working Group (IWG) criteria as at least a 100% increase, or an absolute increase of ≥500/mm\^3 for participants with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) of less than 1,500/mm\^3 before therapy, whichever is greater. A minor response for such participants is defined as an ANC increase of at least 100%, but absolute increase \<500/mm\^3., up to week 52|Participants' Response Based on Bone Marrow Samples by the International MDS Working Group (IWG 2000) During Double-blind Period, The IWG criteria for bone marrow improvement: a complete remission is bone marrow sampling showing less than 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines, with no evidence for dysplasia. A partial remission is ≥ 50% decrease in blasts over pre-treatment. Bone marrow progression is a ≥ 50% increase in blasts that exceed the top range of the pretreatment percentile range: a) \<5% blasts b) 5-10% blasts c) 10-20% blasts d) 20-30% blasts. For example, a participant with \<5% blasts pretreatment with an on study blast increase of 50% which is now \>5% showed bone marrow progression., up to 52 weeks|Participants Showing Cytogenetic Response by the International MDS Working Group (IWG 2000) During Double-blind Period as Evaluated by Central Review, The IWG criteria for evaluating cytogenetic response require a minimum of 20 baseline and post-baseline analyzable metaphases using conventional cytogenetic techniques. A major cytogenetic response is defined as no detectable cytogenetic abnormality if preexisting abnormality was present whereas a minor response requires ≥50% reduction in abnormal metaphases. Progression could be concluded based on as few as 3 metaphases if there were additional abnormalities. The best response is represented., up to 52 weeks|Participants Who Progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) During the Study, Number of participants who progressed to acute myeloid leukemia during the study, summarized at three different timepoints: first 16 weeks of the double-blind study, week 52 of the double-blind study, and up to 36 months which includes the double-blind and open-label periods of the study. The counts are cumulative by timeframe., up to 3 years|Kaplan Meier Estimates of Overall Survival by Randomized Group, Kaplan Meier estimate for median length of survival for study participants as they were randomized at the start of the study., up to 3 years|Participant Count of Deaths During Double-blind and Open-label by Randomized Group, Count of participant deaths throughout the entire study and reported by the original treatment assignment., up to 3 years|Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) Endpoints at Week 12, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire (Yellen, 1997) was used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

In addition to general HRQoL, the FACT-An measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning. The overall score range for the FACT-An is 0-188. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline in the Trial Outcome Index-Anemia (TOI-An) Endpoints at Week 12, The Trial Outcome Index-Anemia (TOI-An) composed of the physical and functional subscales of the FACT-G along with the Anemia subscale was used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The overall score range for the TOI-An is 0-136. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline in the Trial Outcome Index-Fatigue (TOI-F) Endpoints at Week 12, The Trial Outcome Index-Fatigue(TOI-F) composed of the physical and functional subscales of the FACT-G along with the fatigue items from the Anemia subscale was used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The overall score range for the TOI-F is 0-108. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL., Baseline, Week 12|Summary of Participants Who Had Adverse Events (AE) During the Double-blind Period, Counts of study participants who had adverse events (AEs) during the double-blind period by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term. A participant with multiple occurrences of an adverse event within a category is counted only once in that category. Adverse events were evaluated by the investigator.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) was used to grade AE severity. Severity grade 3= severe and undesirable AE. Severity grade 4= life-threatening or disabling AE., up to week 52",,Celgene Corporation,ICON Clinical Research,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,205,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CC-5013-MDS-004|2005-000454-73,2005-07,2008-06,2010-06,2005-09-16,2011-03-17,2011-04-14,"AZ St-Jan Brugge AV, Brugge, 8000, Belgium|UZ Gent, Gent, 900, Belgium|UZ Gasthuisberg, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|CHU Mont Godine, Yvoir, 5530, Belgium|Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, Cedex 9, B.P.156 - 13272, France|CHU d'Angers Service des Maladies du Sang, Angers, 49933, France|Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny Cedex, France|CHRU Lille Service des Maladies du Sang, Lille, 59037, France|CHU Nantes Hematologie et Medicine interne, Nantes, 44093, France|CHU Archet 1Hematologie Clinique, Nice, 06202, France|Hôpital Cochin Hematologie Clinique, Paris, 75014, France|Centre Jean Bernhard Service Onco-Hematologie, Poitiers, 86021, France|Centre Henri Becquerel Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Rouen, 76038, France|CHU Purpan, Place du Dr Baylac, Pavillon des Médecines, Toulouse, 31059, France|CHU Purpan, Place du Dr. Baylac, Pavillion des Medecines, Toulouse, 31059, France|CHU Nancy Hematologie et Medecine interne, Vandoeuvre, 54511, France|Universitaetsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, 01307, Germany|St Johannes Hospital, Duisburg, 47166, Germany|Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, 79106, Germany|Hannover Medical School, Hannover, D-30625, Germany|Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, 64239, Israel|Ospedale Niguarda Ca Granda, Milano, 20162, Italy|University of Pavia Division of Hematology, Pavia, 27100, Italy|University of Medical Centre, Nijmegen, 6526 GA, Netherlands|Hematologie Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, 3000CA, Netherlands|Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, 37007, Spain|Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, 46009, Spain|SU/Sahlgrenska Section of Hematology & Coagulation, Goteborg, SE 413 45, Sweden|Department of Medicine University Hospital, Lund, S-221 85, Sweden|Korolinska Institutet Department of Hematology, Stockholm, 14186, Sweden|University Hospital of Wales, Dept of Haematology, Cardiff, Wales, CF14 4XW, United Kingdom|Leed General Infirmary, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS1 3 EX, United Kingdom|The Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, BH7 7DW, United Kingdom|Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, DD1 9SY, United Kingdom|Kings College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London, SE 5 9RS, United Kingdom|Central Manchester and Manchester Children's University Hospitals NHS Trust, Manchester, M13 9WL, United Kingdom|Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom|John Radcliffe Hospital and the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, OX3 9DS, United Kingdom",
