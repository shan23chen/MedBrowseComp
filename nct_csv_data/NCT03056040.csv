NCT03056040,ALXN1210 Versus Eculizumab in Adult Participants With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) Currently Treated With Eculizumab,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03056040,,COMPLETED,The primary purpose of this study was to assess the noninferiority of ravulizumab compared to eculizumab in adult participants with PNH who were clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least 6 months.,YES,Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH),BIOLOGICAL: Ravulizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Eculizumab,"Percent Change In Lactate Dehydrogenase Levels From Baseline To Day 183, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an indicator of intravascular hemolysis that occurs in participants with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. A decrease in LDH indicates reduction (improvement) in hemolysis. Baseline was defined as the average of all available on-study assessments prior to the first study drug infusion. The percent change in LDH was analyzed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, study visit, and study visit by treatment group interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline LDH and the stratification randomization indicator of packed red blood cells transfusion history (yes/no within 12 months prior to Day 1)., Baseline, Day 183","Number Of Participants With Breakthrough Hemolysis Through Day 183, Breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) was defined as at least one new or worsening symptom or sign of intravascular hemolysis (fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, dyspnea, anemia \[hemoglobin \<10 grams (g)/deciliter (dL)\], major adverse vascular event \[including thrombosis\], dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in the presence of elevated LDH ≥2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)., Baseline through Day 183|Change From Baseline To Day 183 In Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scores, FACIT-Fatigue score ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment value prior to first study drug dose. Change in FACIT-Fatigue score from Baseline to Day 183 was analyzed using an MMRM with the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, the stratification randomization indicator of packed red blood cells transfusion history (yes/no within 12 months prior to Day 1), study visit, and study visit by treatment group interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariate of Baseline FACIT-Fatigue score., Baseline, Day 183|Percentage Of Participants Who Achieved Transfusion Avoidance Through Day 183, Transfusion avoidance was defined as the percentage of participants who remained transfusion free and did not require a transfusion per protocol-specified guidelines (hemoglobin value of ≤9 g/dL with signs or symptoms of sufficient severity to warrant a transfusion, or a hemoglobin value of ≤7 g/dL regardless of presence of clinical signs or symptoms) through Day 183., Baseline through Day 183|Percentage Of Participants With Stabilized Hemoglobin Levels Through Day 183, Stabilized hemoglobin was defined as avoidance of a ≥2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level from Baseline in the absence of transfusion through Day 183., Baseline through Day 183|Number Of Participants With Breakthrough Hemolysis Through End of Study, BTH was defined as at least one new or worsening symptom or sign of intravascular hemolysis (fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, dyspnea, anemia \[hemoglobin \<10 g/dL\], major adverse vascular event \[including thrombosis\], dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in the presence of elevated LDH ≥2 times the ULN., Baseline through end of study (up to 4 years)|Change From Baseline To End of Study In FACIT-Fatigue Scores Through End of Study, FACIT-Fatigue score ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment value prior to first study drug dose. Change in FACIT-Fatigue score from Baseline to Day 183 was analyzed using an MMRM with the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, the stratification randomization indicator of packed red blood cells transfusion history (yes/no within 12 months prior to Day 1), study visit, and study visit by treatment group interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariate of Baseline FACIT-Fatigue score., Baseline, End of Study (up to 4 years)|Percentage Of Participants Who Achieved Transfusion Avoidance Through End of Study, Transfusion avoidance was defined as the percentage of participants who remained transfusion free and did not require a transfusion per protocol-specified guidelines (hemoglobin value of ≤9 g/dL with signs or symptoms of sufficient severity to warrant a transfusion, or a hemoglobin value of ≤7 g/dL regardless of presence of clinical signs or symptoms) through the end of study., Baseline through end of study (up to 4 years)|Percentage Of Participants With Stabilized Hemoglobin Levels Through End of Study, Stabilized hemoglobin was defined as avoidance of a ≥2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level from Baseline in the absence of transfusion through end of study., Baseline through end of study (up to 4 years)",,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,202,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,ALXN1210-PNH-302|2016-002026-36,2017-05-17,2022-02-21,2022-02-21,2017-02-16,2019-03-21,2025-03-25,"Research Site, Duarte, California, 91010, United States|Research Site, Los Angeles, California, 90089, United States|Research Site, Baltimore, Maryland, 21205, United States|Research Site, Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|Research Site, Bronx, New York, 10467, United States|Research Site, Canberra, 2605, Australia|Research Site, Kogarah, 2217, Australia|Research Site, Liverpool, 2170, Australia|Research Site, Melbourne, 3000, Australia|Research Site, Woolloongabba, 4102, Australia|Research Site, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Research Site, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2C4, Canada|Research Site, Montreal, Quebec, H1T 2M4, Canada|Research Site, Amiens, 80054, France|Research Site, La Tronche, 38043, France|Research Site, Marseille, 13273, France|Research Site, Nice, 06200, France|Research Site, Paris, 75475, France|Research Site, Pierre-Benite, 69495, France|Research Site, Saint-Priest-En-Jarez, 42270, France|Research Site, Strasbourg, 67091, France|Research Site, Aachen, 52074, Germany|Research Site, Essen, 45147, Germany|Research Site, Ulm, 89081, Germany|Research Site, Firenze, 50134, Italy|Research Site, Milano, 20122, Italy|Research Site, Napoli, 80131, Italy|Research Site, Torino, 10126, Italy|Research Site, Vicenza, 36100, Italy|Research Site, Fukushima-shi, 960-1295, Japan|Research Site, Kanazawa-shi, 920-8641, Japan|Research Site, Shinagawa-ku, 141-0022, Japan|Research Site, Suita-shi, 565-0871, Japan|Research Site, Suwa-shi, 392-8510, Japan|Research Site, Bucheon-si, 14584, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Daegu, 42415, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Daejeon, 35015, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Incheon, 21565, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 03080, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 06351, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 3722, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Seoul, 6591, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Suwon, 16247, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Maastricht, 6202 AZ, Netherlands|Research Site, Nijmegen, 6525 GA, Netherlands|Research Site, Barcelona, 8036, Spain|Research Site, Madrid, 28040, Spain|Research Site, Majadahonda, 28220, Spain|Research Site, Airdrie, ML6 0JS, United Kingdom|Research Site, Leeds, LS9 7TF, United Kingdom|Research Site, London, SE5 9NU, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/40/NCT03056040/Prot_002.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/40/NCT03056040/SAP_001.pdf"
