Per RECIST 1.1: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.Partial Response (PR): \>/= 30% decrease sum of the diameters of target lesions from baseline sum diameters.

Progressive Disease (PD): \</= 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, from the smallest sum on study with at least a 5 mm absolute increase in the sum of all lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions\* denotes disease progression.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient decrease or increase. Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. Non-complete Response/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of one or more non-target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): Substantial, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., from time of First treatment to week 24",,,Mylan Inc.,Mylan GmbH,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,500,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",MYL-Her 3001|2011-001965-42,2012-07,2016-03,2018-08,2015-06-16,2018-10-30,2022-02-14,"Mylan Investigational Site, Barretos, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Brasilia, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Goiania, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Ijui, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Jau, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Joinville, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Morumbi, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Porto Alegre, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Salvador,, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Santo Andre, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Sorocaba, Brazil|Mylan Investigational Site, Santiago, Chile|Mylan Investigational Site, Temuco, Chile|Mylan Investigational Site, Batumi, Georgia|Mylan Investigational Site, Tblisi, Georgia|Mylan Investigational Site, Budapest, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Debrecen, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Gyod, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Gyula, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Miskolc, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Nyiregyhaza, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Szekszard, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Szolnok, Hungary|Mylan Investigational Site, Ahmedabad, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Bangalore, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Chennai, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Gurgaon, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Hyderabad, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Jaipur, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Karamsad, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Madurai, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Mumbai, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Nashik, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Pune, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Surat, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Vijaywada, India|Mylan Investigational Site, Daugavpils, Latvia|Mylan Investigational Site, Leipaja, Latvia|Mylan Investigational Site, Riga, Latvia|Mylan Investigational Site, Arequipa, Peru|Mylan Investigational Site, Lima, Peru|Mylan Investigational Site, Surquillo, Peru|Mylan Investigational Site, Brasov, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Bucharest, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Bucuresti, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Cluj- Napoca, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Constanta, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Craiva, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Filimon Sirbu, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Iasi, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Oradea, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Timisoara, Romania|Mylan Investigational Site, Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Ivanovo, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Kazan, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Kursk, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Moscow, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Rostov-On-Don, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Ryazan, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Samara, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation|Mylan Investigational Site, Belgrade, Serbia|Mylan Investigational Site, Kamenica, Serbia|Mylan Investigational Site, Sremska, Serbia|Mylan Investigational Site, Bardejov, Slovakia|Mylan Investigational Site, Kosice, Slovakia|Mylan Investigational Site, Nove Zamky, Slovakia|Mylan Investigational Site, Trnava, Slovakia|Mylan Investigator Site, Bloemfontein, South Africa|Mylan Investigator Site, Durban, South Africa|Mylan Investigational Site, George, South Africa|Mylan Investigational Site, Johannesburg, South Africa|Mylan Investigator Site, Kraaifontein, South Africa|Mylan Investigational Site, Port Elizabeth, South Africa|Mylan Investigational Site, Pretoria, South Africa|Mylan Investigational Site, Vereeniging, South Africa|Mylan Investigator Site, Bangkok, Thailand|Mylan Investigator Site, Chiang mai, Thailand|Mylan Investigator Site, Phitsanulok, Thailand|Mylan Investigator Site, Rajthavee, Thailand|Mylan Investigator Site, Songkla, Thailand|Mylan Investigator Site, Ankara, Turkey|Mylan Investigator Site, Istanbul, Turkey|Mylan Investigator Site, Izmir, Turkey|Mylan Investigator Site, Kocaeli, Turkey|Mylan Investigator Site, Cherkassy, Ukraine|Mylan Investigator Site, Chernivtsi, Ukraine|Mylan Investigator Site, Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine|Mylan Investigator Site, Lutsk, Ukraine|Mylan Investigator Site, Lviv, Ukraine|Mylan Investigator Site, Sumy, Ukraine|Mylan Investigator Site, Uzhgorod, Ukraine",
