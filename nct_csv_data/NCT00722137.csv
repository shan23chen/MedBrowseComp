PD was based on the assessment of an Independent Review Committee., Median duration of follow-up of 40 months","Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD) or date of relapse for subjects who experienced complete response (CR) or complete response, unconfirmed (CRu). PD and response were based on the assessment of an Independent Review Committee., Median duration of follow-up of 40 months|Duration of Response, The duration of treatment response was defined as the time from the date of the first response to the date of PD or death due to PD for those participants with a best response of CR, CRu, or PR as determined by the Independent Review Committee. The duration of response for complete responders was defined as the time from the date of the first response to the date of PD or death due to PD for those participants with a best response of CR or CRu verified by bone marrow and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)., Median duration of follow-up of 40 months|Time to Next Anti-lymphoma Treatment (TTNT), The time to next anti-lymphomatreatment was measured from the date of initiation of study treatment as per protocol to the start date of new anti-lymphoma treatment. Death due to disease progression prior to subsequent therapy was considered as an event. Otherwise, time to next anti lymphoma treatment was censored at the date of death or the last date known to be alive., : Median duration of follow-up of 40 months|Treatment-free Interval (TFI), The TFI was defined as the duration from the date of last dose plus 1 day to the start date of the new treatment. Death due to disease progression prior to subsequent therapy was considered as an event. Otherwise, treatment-free interval was censored at the date of death or the last date known to be alive., Median duration of follow-up of 40 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as complete response (CR) + complete response, unconfirmed (CRu) + partial response (PR) as determined by the Independent Review Committee. Response assessment was carried out every 6 weeks for 18 weeks; thereafter, every 8 weeks until PD/initiation of alternate therapy/withdrawal from study/death., Median duration of follow-up of 40 months|Overall Complete Response (CR + CRu), Overall complete response was defined as the number of participants with complete response (CR) and those with unconfirmed complete response (CRu). Response assessment was carried out every 6 weeks for 18 weeks; thereafter, every 8 weeks until PD/initiation of alternate therapy/withdrawal from study/death., Median duration of follow-up of 40 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was measured from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death. If the participant was alive or the vital status was unknown, OS was censored at the date that the subject was last known to be alive., Median duration of follow-up of 40 months|18-Month Survival, 18-month survival was defined as the estimated probability of survival at 18 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate)., Up to month 18 from the time of randomization|Overall Survival (OS) in Long Term Follow-up Period, OS was measured from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death. If the participant was alive or the vital status was unknown, OS was censored at the date that the subject was last known to be alive., Up to 107.4 months|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug, whether or not considered drug related. AEs were collected from the first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Treatment was administered for up to 8 cycles (24 weeks) and AEs were collected for up to 30 days following the last dose of study drug., Up to 107.4 months",,"Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,487,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,26866138-LYM-3002|26866138-LYM-3002CTIL|2007-005669-37|0970313683|U1111-1195-3827,2008-05-01,2014-01-01,2017-06-17,2008-07-25,2014-11-17,2018-07-12,"St. Francis Hosptial and Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut, 06105, United States|Center for Cancer Care at Goshen Hospital, Goshen, Indiana, 46526, United States|Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, 21215, United States|Capitol Comp.
