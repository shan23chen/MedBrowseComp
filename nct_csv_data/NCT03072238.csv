Disease progression for soft tissue is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including baseline, and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm in the sum of diameters of target lesions; progression of non target lesions; the appearance of one or more new lesions. Disease progression for bone lesions is defined as 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline followed by a confirmatory bone scan at least 6 weeks later. rPFS will be analyzed in participants with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) - loss tumors (using the Ventana PTEN immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay)., Up to approximately 31 months|Investigator-Assessed Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) Per PCWG3 Criteria (Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population), Radiographic progression-free survival is defined as time from date of randomization to the first occurrence of documented disease progression, as assessed by the investigator with use of the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression for soft tissue is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including baseline, and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm in the sum of diameters of target lesions; progression of non target lesions; the appearance of one or more new lesions. Disease progression for bone lesions is defined as 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline followed by a confirmatory bone scan at least 6 weeks later. rPFS will be analyzed in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population., Up to approximately 31 months","Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Time to Pain Progression, Time to pain progression was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of confirmed clinically meaningful cancer-related pain progression event. Cancer-related pain progression refers to pain onset for participants who are asymptomatic at baseline or pain worsening for those who are mildly symptomatic at baseline. Pain severity will be graded on a 10-point scale, with 0=no pain and 10=severe pain. Pain severity progression is defined as a ≥ 2-point absolute increase from baseline. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Time to Initiation of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (use of antineoplastic agents: docetaxel, cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone, estramustine, cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitomycin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, or etoposide) for prostate cancer. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Time to Function Deterioration, Time to function deterioration was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of 10-point or more decrease on either the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) PF (Physical Functioning) or RF (Role Functioning) scale scores (range, 0-100) held for two consecutive assessments, or a 10 point or more score decrease followed by death (any cause) within 28 days, whichever occurs first. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first occurrence of PSA progression, per the PCWG3 criteria. PSA progression is defined as a PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the baseline or the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value ≥ 3 weeks later. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Time to First Opioid Use, Time to first opioid use is defined as the documentation of the first opioid prescription for cancer-related pain followed by the participant's record of opioid intake or availability of an Analgesic Quantification Algorithm (AQA) daily score. Participants reporting use of opioid for cancer-related pain at baseline will be excluded from the analysis. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Time to Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE), Time to SSE is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of an SSE. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), An objective response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions \>=4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 and PCWG3 criteria, in participants with measurable disease at baseline. Participants without a post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non-responders. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|PSA Response Rate, PSA response rate is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a PSA decline ≥50% from baseline. Participants without a post-baseline PSA assessment will be considered non-responders. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Investigator-Assessed rPFS Per PCWG3 Criteria in Participants With PTEN-Loss Tumors by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), Investigator-assessed rPFS is defined as time from date of randomization to the first occurrence of documented disease progression, as assessed by the investigator with use of the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or death from any cause, whichever occurs first and will be analyzed in participants with PTEN-loss tumors by NGS. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response until the time of documented disease progression as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 and PCWG3 criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Data collection is still ongoing and the results will be disclosed within 1 year from the Study Completion Date., Up to approximately 7 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory values or abnormal clinical test results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as Adverse Events.
