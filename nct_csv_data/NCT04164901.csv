NCT04164901,Study of Vorasidenib (AG-881) in Participants With Residual or Recurrent Grade 2 Glioma With an IDH1 or IDH2 Mutation (INDIGO),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04164901,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Study AG881-C-004 is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy of vorasidenib to placebo in participants with residual or recurrent Grade 2 glioma with an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation who have undergone surgery as their only treatment. Participants will be required to have central confirmation of IDH mutation status prior to randomization.

These subscales are summed to provide a total score. The total score is given at the end of treatment and total scores range from 0 to 200.
