NCT02166463,"Brentuximab Vedotin and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Children and Young Adults With Stage IIB, Stage IIIB, IVA, or IVB Hodgkin Lymphoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02166463,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase III trial studies brentuximab vedotin and combination chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating children and young adults with stage IIB with bulk, stage IIIB, IVA, or IVB Hodgkin lymphoma. Combinations of biological substances in brentuximab vedotin may be able to carry cancer-killing substances directly to Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vincristine sulfate, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without brentuximab vedotin in treating children with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma.",YES,Ann Arbor Stage IIB Hodgkin Lymphoma|Ann Arbor Stage IIIB Hodgkin Lymphoma|Ann Arbor Stage IVA Hodgkin Lymphoma|Ann Arbor Stage IVB Hodgkin Lymphoma|Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma|Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: Bleomycin Sulfate|DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Etoposide|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Methylprednisolone|OTHER: Pharmacological Study|DRUG: Prednisone|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate,"Event Free Survival (EFS), Where Events Include Disease Progression or Relapse, Second Malignancy, or Death, Primary analysis will be based 1-sided log rank test comparison of EFS curves between the 2 randomized arms per intention-to-treat principle. Progression is defined as an ≥50% increase of in the product of the perpendicular diameters of any of the involved nodes or nodal masses or focal organ lesions in sites that were persistently PET positive; or recurrent PET positive lesions (Deauville 4, 5) in sites that had previously been PET negative regardless of change of size, as was the development of new PET avid measurable lesion(s) \>1.5cm in any axis, or new sites of assessable disease. Relapse is defined in patients who achieved a prior CR but subsequently has an increase of ≥50% of the PPD in prior nodal or extranodal sites in a recurrently PET positive lesion(s), or the development of new measurable lesion(s) \>1.5cm in any axis, or new sites of assessable disease. Second malignancy is defined based on report of a cancer that is not considered to be classic Hodgkin Lymphoma., Up to 48 months after the last enrollment","Percentages of Patients With Early Response Defined as no Slow Responding Lesions (SRL) and no Progressive Disease (PD) at Any Disease Sites Determined by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Per Deauville Criteria Through Central Review, The percentages of patients (with available PET scan) with no SRL and no PD will be compared between the two randomized arms to see if brentuximab vedotin in the chemotherapy backbone of doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, etoposide, prednisone and cyclophosphamide (Bv-AVEPC) arm has a higher rate of early response compared to doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vincristine sulfate, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide (ABVE-PC) arm. Two-sample Z test of proportions at 1-sided alpha level of 0.05 will be used for these comparisons., After 42 days of chemotherapy|Percentages of Patients Experiencing Grade 3+ Peripheral Neuropathy Assessed by Modified Balis Scale, The percentages of patients experiencing grade 3+ peripheral neuropathy assessed by the treating clinician using the modified Balis scale. The ""Modified Balis scale of Pediatric Neuropathy"" allows clinicians to assign a score for sensory or motor neuropathy symptoms separately. Scores range from 1 to 4 with 1 being the least symptomatic state and 4 indicating a severe debility. The percentages of patients (with a score \>/=3) will be compared between the 2 arms by two-sample Z test at 1-sided alpha level of 0.05., From the enrollment of the patient to the time of analysis or the last follow-up; an average of 3.6 years.","Childhood International Prognostic Score (CHIPS) Score, CHIPS will be computed for all patients and summarized by descriptive statistics. Will examine the association between CHIPS and early response by cross-tabulations and Chi-square tests within each arm separately, as well as logistic regression model where early response is the outcome variable and CHIPS the predictor variable combining the 2 arms with adjustment for randomized chemotherapy., Baseline|Dose of Radiation Received by Normal Tissues Following Chemotherapy on Either Study Arm, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize RT doses received by normal tissues on this study. Two-sample t-test will be used to compare the doses received on this study to those on prior studies., Up to 48 months|Efficacy of Involved Site Radiotherapy (ISRT) by Analyzing the Event-free Survival of Patients Treated With Response-adapted ISRT and by Evaluating Patterns of Relapse Following ISRT, EFS for patients on each arm as well as those receiving ISRT or those with slow early response (SER) on each arm will be estimated. One-sample log rank test will be used to compare the observed EFS to the assumed baseline of 82% at 3 years to see if the observed EFS is significantly lower than the projection in these subsets., Up to 3 years|Risk of Relapse Among RRL Subjects That Have at Least One Lesion That is Deauville 3 at PET 2, The risk of relapse for cases that are RRL, but have Deauville 3 lesions, will be compared to those that are classified as complete metabolic response at PET2 with solely Deauville 1 or 2 lesions with K-sample test., Up to 48 months after the last enrollment|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analyses, PK concentration time profile will be evaluated., Pre-dose and end of infusion on day 1, days 2, 3, 8, and 15 of cycle 4 and pre-dose on day 1 and day 22 of cycle 5 (each cycle = 21 days)",National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE3,600,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2014-01223|NCI-2014-01223|s15-00950|AHOD1331|AHOD1331|U10CA180886,2015-03-19,2021-12-31,2025-10-03,2014-06-18,2023-05-31,2025-03-25,"Children's Hospital of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|USA Health Strada Patient Care Center, Mobile, Alabama, 36604, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Banner Children's at Desert, Mesa, Arizona, 85202, United States|Phoenix Childrens Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona, 85016, United States|Banner University Medical Center -
