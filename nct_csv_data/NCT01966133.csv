NCT01966133,TACE as an Adjuvant Therapy After Hepatectomy for HCC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01966133,,UNKNOWN,Investigators hypothesise that the use of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) after liver resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can eradicate residual cancer cells in the liver and thus improve survival of patients with high risk factors for residual tumor. The aim of this study is to compare the survival of patients with high risk factors for residual tumor undergoing liver resection plus post-operative TACE versus liver resection alone.,NO,Hepatocellular Carcinoma,DRUG: Ethiodized Oil + Doxorubicin,"Disease-free survival, 3 years after operation","Overall Survival, 3-year after surgery|Complications of transarterial chemoembolisation, 3-month after transarterial chemoembolisation","Health-related quality of life assessment, The quality of life assessment was measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Questionnaire (Chinese version 3), 1-year after surgery",Jia Fan,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,280,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,LCI-125-009,2011-08,2016-08,2017-08,2013-10-21,,2017-01-09,"Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200032, China",
