NCT00774930,An Efficacy and Safety Study of Somatuline Depot (Lanreotide) Injection to Treat Carcinoid Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00774930,ELECT,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study was to determine whether monthly deep subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of lanreotide Autogel (Somatuline Depot) were effective and safe in controlling diarrhoea and flushing by reducing the usage of s.c. short-acting octreotide as a rescue medication to control symptoms in subjects with carcinoid syndrome.,YES,Carcinoid Syndrome,DRUG: Lanreotide|DRUG: Placebo,"Percentage of Days With Subcutaneous Octreotide as Rescue Medication, Use of s.c. octreotide required to control symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome, measured as the percentage of days that s.c. octreotide was used as rescue medication, based on subject Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) or Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) diary records., 16-week DB phase","Average Frequency of Diarrhoea Events (Per Day) Based on Subject Diary Records., 16-week DB phase|Average Frequency of Flushing Events (Per Day) Based on Subject Diary Records., 16-week DB phase|Percentage of Days of Use of Other Rescue Medication, Usage of other concomitant rescue medications for diarrhoea and/or flushing events, measured as the percentage of days that the medications were used as rescue medication based on subject IVRS/IWRS diary records. Subjects were required to record the use and dose of s.c. octreotide, if any, as well as the use of other concomitant rescue medications (e.g. loperamide 2 mg tabs, and/or tincture of opium)., 16-week DB phase|Proportion of Subjects Who Rolled Over Into the IOL Phase Before Completing the DB Phase of the Study, Subjects who rolled over early were those who received less than four DB injections before receiving the first IOL injection., 16-week DB phase|Changes From Baseline in ""Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL)"" Score (Based on Items 29 and 30 of the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC-QLQ] C30), Baseline is defined as the last non-missing observation obtained prior to the initiation of study treatment.

Q29 and Q30 range from 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent) with 1 being worst case and 7 the most favourable answer. Scores were derived according to the rules contained within the EORTC scoring manual. All of the scores range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for global health status/QoL represents high QoL. The principle for scoring the scale is: Estimate the average of the items (I1, I2, ..., In) that contribute to the scale; this is the raw score. Raw score = RS = (I1 + I2 +...+ In)/n.

For global health status/QoL: Score = {(RS - 1)/range} x 100, where range is the difference between the maximum possible value of RS and the minimum possible value of RS., Baseline and Week 12 of DB phase|Changes From Baseline in ""Gastrointestinal (G.I). Symptoms"" Subscore (Based on Items Q34, Q35, Q36, Q37 and Q38 of EORTC G.I. Neuroendocrine Tumour [NET] 21], Baseline is defined as the last non-missing observation obtained prior to the initiation of study treatment.

The QLQ-G.I.NET21 questionnaire contains 21 single items (Q31 to Q51) which are supplemental items to the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Q31 to Q51 range from 1 to 4 with 1 being the most favourable answer and 4 the worst case (1 = Not at all, 2 = A little, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = Very much). Based on these items the scores were generated. All of the scores range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology. The principle for scoring the scale is: Estimate the average of the items (I1, I2, ..., In) that contribute to the scale; this is the raw score. RS = (I1 + I2 +...+ In)/n.

For symptom scales: Score = {(RS - 1)/range} x 100, where range is the difference between the maximum possible value of RS and the minimum possible value of RS., Baseline and Week 12 of DB phase|Changes From Baseline in QoL in ""Endocrine Symptoms"" Subscore (Assessed Based on Items Q31, Q32 and Q33 Using EORTC QLQ-G.I.NET-21 Questionnaires), Baseline is defined as the last non-missing observation obtained prior to the initiation of study treatment.
