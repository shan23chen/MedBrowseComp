NCT03735121,A Study to Investigate Atezolizumab Subcutaneous in Patients With Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03735121,,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of atezolizumab subcutaneous (SC) compared with atezolizumab intravenous (IV) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who have not been exposed to cancer immunotherapy (CIT) and for whom prior platinum-based therapy has failed. The study is comprised of two parts, as follows: A dose-finding part (Part 1, Phase Ib) will aim to identify the dose of atezolizumab SC to be tested in Part 2. A dose-confirmation part (Part 2, Phase III, randomized) will aim to confirm that the dose moved forward from Part 1 yields drug exposure that is comparable to that of atezolizumab IV.",YES,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: rHuPH20,"Part 1: Serum Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Atezolizumab at Cycle 1, Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 2 (Cycle length =21 days for cohorts 1 and 3 and 14 days for cohort 2)|Part 2: Observed Serum Ctrough of Atezolizumab at Cycle 1, Predose on Day 1 of Cycle 2 (Cycle length =21 days for cohorts 1 and 3 and 14 days for cohort 2)|Part 2: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 21 Days (AUC 0-21 d) at Cycle 1, From start of dosing up to Day 21 in Cycle 1 (Cycle length= 21 days)","Part 1: Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Atezolizumab, Predose and post dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and post dose on Days 3 and 8 of Cycle 1 (Cycle length = 21 days for cohorts 1 and 3 and 14 days for cohort 2)|Part 1: Time to Maximum Serum Concentration (Tmax) of Atezolizumab, Predose and post dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and post dose on Days 3 and 8 of Cycle 1 (Cycle length = 21 days for cohorts 1 and 3 and 14 days for cohort 2)|Part 1: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUClast) of Atezolizumab, Predose and up to 21 days post dose in Cycle 1 for cohorts 1 and 3 and from predose up to 14 days post last dose in Cycle 1 for cohort 2 (Cycle length= 21 days for cohorts 1 and 3 and 14 days for cohort 2)|Part 1: Serum Atezolizumab Concentration at Specified Timepoint During SC Administration, Cycle length =21 days for cohorts 1 and 3 and 14 days for cohort 2.

CR is the disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters in the absence of CR., From treatment initiation until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (Up to approximately 72 months).|Part 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from study start to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 or or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., From study start to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (Up to approximately 72 months).|Part 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time from study entry to death from any cause., From study start to death from any cause (Up to approximately 72 months)|Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

PF scale has 5 items evaluating the extent to which participants have trouble doing strenuous activities; taking long walks \& short walks; need to stay in bed or a chair; need help with eating, dressing, bathing/using toilet. RF scale has 2 items evaluating extent to which participants are limited in doing work \& pursuing leisure activities in previous week. GHS/QoL scale has 2 items evaluating participants' overall health \& QoL in previous week. Questions are answered on a 4-point Likert scale (where 1=""Not at all"" to 4=""Very much"") for physical and role functioning \& a 7-point scale (where 1=""Very poor"" to 7=""Excellent"") for GHS/QoL. For each scale, mean of the items are linearly transformed to obtain scores from 0-100, where 100 =best possible score.
