It is a 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health).The PCS score is a summary score representing overall physical health, which is derived from the 8 domain scores. As with each domain score, the PCS score ranges from 0 to 100; higher scores represent better health. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Missing post-Baseline data were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. The scores were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, adjusting for Baseline sub-scale score, treatment, and country. Positive changes from Baseline indicate improvement., Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and every 6 months after discontinuation of study treatment for 24 months (up to a maximum of 3 study years)|Change From Baseline in SF-36 v2 Scores for the Mental Component Summary (MCS), The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered, health-related quality of life (QoL) metric.
