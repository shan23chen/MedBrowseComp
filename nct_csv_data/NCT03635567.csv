NCT03635567,"Efficacy and Safety Study of First-line Treatment With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Women With Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer (MK-3475-826/KEYNOTE-826)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03635567,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) plus one of four platinum-based chemotherapy regimens compared to the efficacy and safety of placebo plus one of four platinum-based chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of adult women with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. Possible chemotherapy regimens include: paclitaxel plus cisplatin with or without bevacizumab and paclitaxel plus carboplatin with or without bevacizumab.

The primary study hypotheses are that the combination of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to placebo plus chemotherapy with respect to: 1) Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by the Investigator, or, 2) Overall Survival (OS).",YES,Cervical Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Placebo to pembrolizumab,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator in Participants With Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

The OS for all randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is presented., Up to approximately 46 months","Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Investigator, ORR was defined as the percentage of the participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters). The ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Investigator is presented., Up to approximately 46 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Investigator, For participants who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. The DOR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Investigator is presented., Up to approximately 46 months|Percentage of Participants That Were PFS Event-Free (PFS Rate) at Month 12 Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Investigator, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥ 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.

Participant responses to ""How would you rate your overall health during the past week?"" (Item 29) and ""How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?"" (Item 30) are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Raw scores are standardized with linear transformation so that scores range from 0-100. A higher combined score indicates a better overall health status. Participant post-baseline scores were classified based on change from baseline, ""Improved"": a ≥10-point improvement in score and confirmed by the next visit; ""Stable"": a ≥10-point increase or \<10-point change in score OR a \<10-point change in score and a ≥10-point increase in score at the next visit; or ""Deteriorated"": a ≥10-point deterioration in score when the criteria for improvement/stability weren't met. Participants who didn't meet ""Improved"", ""Stable"", or ""Deteriorated"" criteria reported as ""Other""., Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose) and up to approximately 46 months",,Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,617,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",3475-826|MK-3475-826|KEYNOTE-826|184183|2018-001440-53,2018-10-25,2022-10-03,2024-06-04,2018-08-17,2023-10-12,2024-06-25,"Alaska Women's Cancer Care ( Site 1770), Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Arizona Oncology Associates, PC- HAL ( Site 8005), Phoenix, Arizona, 85016, United States|UC Irvine Health ( Site 1796), Orange, California, 92868, United States|Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven ( Site 1809), New Haven, Connecticut, 06510, United States|H.
