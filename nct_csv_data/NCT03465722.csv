NCT03465722,(VOYAGER) Study of Avapritinib vs Regorafenib in Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic GIST,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03465722,,COMPLETED,"This is an open-label, randomized, Phase 3 study in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic GIST (advanced GIST) of avapritinib (also known as BLU-285) versus regorafenib in patients previously treated with imatinib and 1 or 2 other TKIs.",YES,GIST,DRUG: avapritinib|DRUG: regorafenib,"Efficacy of Avapritinib Based on Progression-free Survival (PFS) Determined by Central Radiological Assessment Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), Version 1.1, To demonstrate the efficacy of avapritinib based on progression-free survival (PFS) determined by central radiological assessment per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), version 1.1 in patients with advanced GIST following 2 or 3 regimens of prior treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), including imatinib, compared to patients treated with regorafenib. A progressively growing tumor must meet the following criteria: a) the target lesions must be greater or equal to 2cm in size and be a new GIST active lesion or b) the target lesions must be expanding on at least 2 sequential imaging studies., 24 Months","Objective Response Rate (ORR) Determined by Central Radiology Assessment Per mRECIST, Version 1.1, To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) determined by central radiology assessment per mRECIST, version 1.1 in patients with advanced GIST treated with avapritinib compared to patients treated with regorafenib. A complete response (CR) per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) is defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions. A partial response (PR) is defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 24 Months|Overall Survival (OS) in Patients With Advanced GIST Treated With Avapritinib Compared to Patients Treated With Regorafenib, To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced GIST treated with avapritinib compared to patients treated with regorafenib, 24 Months|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC-QLQ-30). Change in Individual Scores in Patients With Advanced GIST Treated With Avapritinib Compared to Patients Treated With Regorafenib, The Global Health Status Score is derived from question 29 and 30 on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 tool. The change in score was assessed between baseline and week 12 in patients treated with advanced GIST treated with avapritinib compared to patients treated with regorafenib. The Global Health Status Score score range is 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating better global health status. A positive change indicates improvement in global health status., Difference between baseline and week 12 of treatment",,Blueprint Medicines Corporation,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,476,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,BLU-285-1303,2018-03-26,2020-03-09,2021-09-15,2018-03-14,2021-05-14,2022-10-06,"Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Phoenix, Arizona, 85054, United States|UCLA Hematology/Oncology - Santa Monica, Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers, Boulder, Colorado, 80303, United States|Washington Hospital Center - Oncology and Hematology, Washington, District of Columbia, 20010, United States|Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|University of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33146, United States|Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, 33612, United States|Northside Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, 30341, United States|Northwestern Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|The University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States|Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Washington University in Saint Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63130, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10065, United States|Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States|OHSU - Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19111, United States|UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15232, United States|Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, Tennessee, 37203, United States|USO - Texas Oncology, Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|Texas Oncology - Denton South, Denton, Texas, 76210, United States|University of Texas MD Anderson, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Texas Oncology - Waco, Waco, Texas, 76712, United States|Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84112, United States|Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|Summit Cancer Centers, Spokane, Washington, 99216, United States|Medical College of Wisconsin - Froedtert Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States|Flinders Medical Center, Adelaide, Australia|Monash Health, Clayton, Australia|The Canberra Hospital, Garran, Australia|AKH, Klinik f.
