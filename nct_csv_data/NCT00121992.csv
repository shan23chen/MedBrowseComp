NCT00121992,"Docetaxel, Doxorubicin (A), Cyclophosphamide (C) (TAC) vs 5-Fluorouracil, A, C (5FAC) Breast Cancer Adjuvant Treatment",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00121992,,COMPLETED,"This is a prospective, non-blinded randomized phase III trial. Patients will be post-surgically stratified at inclusion first according to the participating institution, then according to menopausal status and will be randomly assigned to receive either:

* TAC: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks (q3w) in combination with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks.
* FAC: 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks.",YES,Breast Neoplasms,DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide,"Disease-free Survival (DFS) Events, DFS is calculated from the date of randomization until the first date of recurrence local, regional or distant, second primary tumor or death., 10 years","Overall Survival (OS), OS was determined from the date of randomization until the date of death for any reason.

OS is calculated from the date of randomization up to the first date of death by any cause., 10 years|The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AE), Safety was assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry). AE grade were defined by the NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 1.0., Through study treatment, and average of 4 months|Best Score During Study for Global Health Status Scale, The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used.

Questionnaires were self-administered to patients during the 14 days prior to randomisation baseline, at six prospective time points corresponding to chemotherapy cycles, with the time window related to each chemotherapy cycle defined as the period between the day following the first chemotherapy dose of the corresponding cycle and the day of the first dose of the following cycle, and then at 44, 68 and 120 weeks of the study.

The Global Health Status Scale has been used, which is calculated with questions 29 and 30 from the EORTC QLQ-C30. From this scale, the best score is the highest score observed during study (of all the questionnaires completed by patient). In this scale, scores range from 0 to 100 and a high score represents a high level of functioning or HRQoL., 120 weeks|Number of Disease Free Survival Events in Hormone-receptor Positive and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Positive Status Subgroup, Hormone-receptor status and HER2 receptor status was analysed in Paraffin-embedded tumor samples obtained at the time of surgery, and were processed centrally. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of local, regional or metastatic relapse or the date of second primary cancer or death from any cause whichever occurs first., 10 year|Disease Free Survival in Hormonal Receptor Positive and HER2 Negative Subgroup, Hormone-receptor status and HER2 receptor status was analysed in Paraffin-embedded tumor samples obtained at the time of surgery, and were processed centrally.
