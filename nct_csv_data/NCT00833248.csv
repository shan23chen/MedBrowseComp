NCT00833248,Neoadjuvant Study Investigating Degarelix in Patients Suffering From Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00833248,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this phase 3B trial was to see how well a new trial drug (degarelix) works in terms of reducing the size of the prostate volume in prostate cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo subsequent radiotherapy for treatment of their prostate cancer. Prior to receiving radiotherapy, it is recommended that patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer are pre-treated with hormone therapy (so-called neoadjuvant therapy) which is known to reduce the size of the prostate and thereby decrease the required radiation field and enable a more safe and effective treatment. In this trial, participants were randomly selected (like flipping a coin) to receive either degarelix given alone or a standard hormone therapy (combination of goserelin and bicalutamide. The treatment was given for three months and the prostate size was measured by ultra sound at the beginning and at the end of the trial. The participants were required to come to the clinic for 5 or 6 visits during the three months.",YES,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: Degarelix|DRUG: Goserelin|DRUG: Bicalutamide,"Change From Baseline in Prostate Size Based on Trans Rectal Ultra Sound (TRUS) at Week 12 (Full Analysis Set), TRUS is a method of measuring the size of the prostate., After treatment of 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Prostate Size Based on Trans Rectal Ultra Sound (TRUS) at Week 12 (Per Protocol Analysis Set), TRUS is a method of measuring the size of the prostate., After treatment of 12 weeks compared to Baseline","Change From Baseline in Total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Week 4, 8, and 12, The IPSS is a tool commonly used to assess the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and to monitor the progress of the disease once treatment has been initiated. The participant completes a questionnaire containing 7 questions regarding incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia. Each question is assigned a score of 0-5. The total score is then classified according to the following scale: 0 to 7 = mildly symptomatic; 8 to 19 = moderately symptomatic; and 20 to 35 = severely symptomatic., After treatment of 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Serum Testosterone Levels During the Study, After treatment of 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels During the Study, After treatment of 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Serum Oestradiol Levels During the Study, After treatment of 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Quality of Life (QoL) Related to Urinary Symptoms at Each Visit, The IPSS questionnaire included an additional single question to assess the participant's QoL in relation to his urinary symptoms. The question was: 'If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition the way it is now, how would you feel about that?' The possible answers to this question ranged from 'delighted' (a score of '0') to 'terrible' (a score of '6')., After treatment of 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in Vital Signs and Body Weight, This outcome measure included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, and body weight.
