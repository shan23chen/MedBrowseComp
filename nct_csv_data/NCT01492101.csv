NCT01492101,The BEACON Study (Breast Cancer Outcomes With NKTR-102),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01492101,BEACON,COMPLETED,"The study is designed as an open-label, randomized, parallel, two arm, multicenter, international Phase 3 study in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.

The primary study objective is to compare overall survival of patients who receive NKTR-102 given once every 21 days to patients who receive treatment of Physician's Choice selected from a list of seven single-agent intravenous therapies.",YES,Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer|Metastatic Breast Cancer,DRUG: NKTR-102|DRUG: Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC),"Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Overall Survival: Intention to Treat (ITT) Population, Duration of OS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death due to any cause. Subjects were followed until their date of death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further follow-up for survival, or final database closure. OS was determined using the ITT population which included all subjects randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment arms. Subjects who were lost-to-follow-up or were not known to have died were censored at last date they were shown to be alive. Subjects who did not have any follow-up since the date of randomization were censored at the date of randomization., 36 Months","Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS): ITT Population, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of disease progression (assessed by the investigator according to RECIST version 1.1) or death due to any cause. PFS was determined using the ITT population which included all subjects randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment arms. For subjects whose disease did not progress or who did not die, the PFS time was censored at the time of the last tumor assessment that demonstrated lack of disease progression. For subjects who received new anti-cancer therapy, the PFS time was censored at the start of the new anti-cancer therapy., Up to 38 months.|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR): ITT Population, CBR was defined as the proportion of subjects with a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months (≥ 182 days)., Up to 38 months.|Duration of Response (DOR): Efficacy Evaluable Population, DOR was defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until the earliest evidence of disease progression or death from any cause. Subjects who were alive without documented disease progression per RECIST version 1.1 were censored at the date of last tumor assessment without disease progression or start of new anti-cancer therapy for the study disease., Up to 38 months.|Incidence of Dose Reductions: Safety Population, Proportion of subjects who had a reduction in dose., Up to 38 months.|Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Individual Scale, Overall Score: ITT Population, The QLQ-C30 is composed of 5 multi-item functional scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning), a global health status/QoL scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (financial impact, appetite loss, diarrhoea, constipation, insomnia and dyspnoea). Most items are scaled 1 to 4 (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) except the items contributing to the global health status/QoL, which are 7-point questions (1 = very poor to 7 = excellent). Raw scores were transformed using a linear transformation to standardize the results so that scores range from 0 to 100. n=number of subjects who completed each individual scale. Note that for scores measuring function, a higher score represented a higher ""better"" level of functioning, while for scores measuring symptoms, a higher score represented a lower ""worse"" level of symptoms., Up to 39 months|QLQ-C30 Individual Scale, Change Over Time: ITT Population, The QLQ-C30 is composed of 5 multi-item functional scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning), a global health status/QoL scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (financial impact, appetite loss, diarrhea, constipation, insomnia and dyspnea). Most items are scaled 1 to 4 (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) except the items contributing to the global health status/QoL, which are 7-point questions (from 1 = very poor to 7 = excellent). Raw scores were transformed using a linear transformation to standardize the results so that scores range from 0 to 100. n=number of subjects who completed each individual scale. Note that for scores measuring function, a higher score represented a higher ""better"" level of functioning, while for scores measuring symptoms, a higher score represented a lower ""worse"" level of symptoms., From Baseline to Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, Week 32, Week 40, Week 48, Week 56.|Quality of Life Questionnaire-breast Cancer-specific Module (BR23) Score Value: ITT Population, The QLQ-BR23 incorporates 5 multi-item scales to assess systemic therapy side effects, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, body image and sexual functioning, and 3 single items to assess sexual enjoyment, upset by hair loss and future perspective. Most items were scaled one to four except the items contributing to the global health status/QoL, which were seven-point questions. Raw scores were transformed using a linear transformation to standardize the results so that scores ranged from 0-100. Note that for scores measuring function, a higher score represented a higher ""better"" level of functioning, while for scores measuring symptoms, a higher score represented a lower ""worse"" level of symptoms., Baseline|BR23 Score Change Over Time: ITT Population, The QLQ-BR23 incorporates 5 multi-item scales to assess systemic therapy side effects, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, body image and sexual functioning, and 3 single items assess sexual enjoyment, upset by hair loss and future perspective.

The population pharmacokinetic (PK) model-derived mean AUC values were computed by integration from t = 0 (start of first dose) to 21 days after the last dose. Integration was implemented using a separate compartment defined as the amount of drug or metabolite in the central compartment divided by the model-estimated volume of distribution., Up to 38 months.|Population Mean ± SD Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for NKTR-102 and Metabolites After Multiple Administration of 145 mg/m^2 NKTR-102 [26], Plasma concentrations of NKTR-102 and its major metabolites irinotecan, SN38, SN38G, and APC were measured using validated analytical methods. The population PK model-derived mean Cmax values were computed by integration from t = 0 (start of first dose) to 21 days after the last dose. Integration was implemented using a separate compartment defined as the amount of drug or metabolite in the central compartment divided by the model-estimated volume of distribution., Up to 38 months.|Population Mean ± SD Elimination Half-life (t½) for NKTR-102 After Multiple Administration of 145 mg/m^2 NKTR-102 [27], Plasma concentrations of NKTR-102 and its major metabolites irinotecan, SN38, SN38G, and APC were measured using validated analytical methods. The population PK model-derived mean t½ values were computed by integration from t = 0 (start of first dose) to 21 days after the last dose. Integration was implemented using a separate compartment defined as the amount of drug or metabolite in the central compartment divided by the model-estimated volume of distribution. The t½ of all analytes was primarily driven by NKTR-102. Thus, the NKTR-102 t½ of 37 days also applies to all NKTR-102 metabolites., Up to 38 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR): Efficacy Evaluable Population, ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 The analyses were performed for subjects in the efficacy evaluable population who had measurable disease as determined by the investigator at baseline., Up to 38 months.",,Nektar Therapeutics,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,852,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,11-PIR-11,2011-12,2016-04,2016-06,2011-12-14,2021-06-01,2021-06-01,"Arizona Oncology Associates, PC - NAHOA, Flagstaff, Arizona, 86001, United States|Providence Health System - Southern California d/b/a Roy and Patricia Disney Family Cancer Center, Burbank, California, 91505, United States|University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|PMK Medical Group, Inc., DBA Ventura County Hematology Oncology Specialists, Oxnard, California, 93030, United States|Wilshire Oncology Medical Group, Inc., Pasadena, California, 91105, United States|Desert Hematology Oncology Medical Group, Rancho Mirage, California, 92270, United States|University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Kaiser Permanente, Vallejo, California, 94589, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers, Denver, Colorado, 80220, United States|Pre clinical Science Bldg LR3, Washington, District of Columbia, 20007, United States|Medstar, Washington, District of Columbia, 20010, United States|Mayo Clinic in Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Advanced Medical Specialties, Miami, Florida, 33176, United States|Florida Cancer Research Institute, Plantation, Florida, 33324, United States|Hematology Oncology Associates of the Treasure Coast, Port Saint Lucie, Florida, 34592, United States|Northeast Georgia Cancer Care, Athens, Georgia, 30607, United States|Peachtree Hematology Oncology Consultants, Atlanta, Georgia, 30318, United States|Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Central Georgia Cancer Care, Macon, Georgia, 31201, United States|Northwest Georgia Oncology Centers, P.C., Marietta, Georgia, 30060, United States|Summit Cancer Care, P.C., Savannah, Georgia, 31405, United States|The University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|Oncology Specialists, Niles, Illinois, 60714, United States|Illinois Cancer Care, P.C., Peoria, Illinois, 61547, United States|IU Health Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|Hall-Perrine Cancer Center, 3rd Floor, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 52403, United States|Kansas City Cancer Center, Overland Park, Kansas, 66210, United States|Louisville Oncology Clinical Research Program, Louisville, Kentucky, 40207, United States|Maryland Oncology Hematology, P.A., Columbia, Maryland, 21044, United States|Minnesota Oncology Hematology, P.A., Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55404, United States|University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Coborn Cancer Center, Saint Cloud, Minnesota, 56303, United States|Missouri Cancer Associates, Columbia, Missouri, 65201, United States|Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Missouri Baptist Medical Center, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63131, United States|Frontier Cancer Center and Blood Institute, Billings, Montana, 59102, United States|Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, 03756, United States|Hematology-Oncology Associates of Northern NJ, PA, Morristown, New Jersey, 07962, United States|The cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 08901, United States|Cooper University Hospital, Voorhees, New Jersey, 08043, United States|UNM Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87106, United States|New York Oncology Hematology, P.C., Albany, New York, 12206, United States|Monte fiore, Bronx, New York, 10461, United States|Sciode Medical Associates, PLLC, d.b.a.
