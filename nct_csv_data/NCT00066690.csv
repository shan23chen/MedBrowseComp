NCT00066690,Suppression of Ovarian Function With Either Tamoxifen or Exemestane Compared With Tamoxifen Alone in Treating Premenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00066690,SOFT,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast tumor cells. Ovarian function suppression combined with hormone therapy using tamoxifen or exemestane may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. It is not yet known whether suppression of ovarian function plus either tamoxifen or exemestane is more effective than tamoxifen alone in preventing the recurrence of hormone-responsive breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial studies ovarian suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane to see how well they work compared to tamoxifen alone in treating premenopausal women who have undergone surgery for hormone-responsive breast cancer.",YES,Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer|Progesterone Receptor Positive Tumor|Recurrent Breast Carcinoma|Stage IA Breast Cancer|Stage IB Breast Cancer|Stage IIA Breast Cancer|Stage IIB Breast Cancer|Stage IIIA Breast Cancer,DRUG: Exemestane|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|PROCEDURE: Oophorectomy|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Triptorelin,"Disease-free Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where disease-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first appearance of one of the following: invasive breast cancer recurrence at local, regional, or distant site, invasive contralateral breast cancer, second (non-breast) invasive cancer, or death without cancer event; or censored at date of last follow-up., 5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 67 months.","Breast Cancer-free Interval, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where breast cancer-free interval is defined as the time from randomization to invasive breast cancer recurrence at local, regional, or distant site, or invasive contralateral breast cancer; or censored at date of last follow up., 5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 67 months.|Distant Recurrence-free Interval, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where distant recurrence-free Interval is defined as the time from randomization to invasive breast cancer recurrence at distant site, or invasive contralateral breast cancer; or censored at date of last follow up., 5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 67 months.|Overall Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive at 8 years from randomization, where overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause; or censored at date last known alive., 8-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 8 years",,ETOP IBCSG Partners Foundation,Breast International Group|Cancer and Leukemia Group B|National Cancer Institute (NCI)|NSABP Foundation Inc|NCIC Clinical Trials Group|North Central Cancer Treatment Group|SWOG Cancer Research Network,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,3066,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IBCSG 24-02 / BIG 2-02|NCI-2009-01086|CDR0000316456|BIG 2-02|2004-000166-13|IBCSG-24-02|U24CA075362,2003-12-17,2024-11-06,2024-11-06,2003-08-07,2016-09-22,2025-03-30,"University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Alta Bates Summit Medical Center-Herrick Campus, Berkeley, California, 94704, United States|Mills -
