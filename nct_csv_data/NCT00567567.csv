NCT00567567,Comparing Two Different Myeloablation Therapies in Treating Young Patients Who Are Undergoing a Stem Cell Transplant for High-Risk Neuroblastoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00567567,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial compares two different high-dose chemotherapy regimens followed by a stem cell transplant in treating younger patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps kill any tumor cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient?s bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the high- chemotherapy. It is not yet known which regimen of high-dose chemotherapy is more effective for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma undergoing a peripheral blood stem cell transplant.",YES,Localized Resectable Neuroblastoma|Localized Unresectable Neuroblastoma|Recurrent Neuroblastoma|Regional Neuroblastoma|Stage 4 Neuroblastoma|Stage 4S Neuroblastoma,PROCEDURE: Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Etoposide|RADIATION: External Beam Radiation Therapy|BIOLOGICAL: Filgrastim|DRUG: Isotretinoin|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Melphalan|PROCEDURE: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation|OTHER: Pharmacological Study|DRUG: Thiotepa|DRUG: Topotecan Hydrochloride|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate Liposome,"Event-free Survival Rate, Comparison of EFS curves, starting from the time of randomization, by treatment group (single CEM vs. tandem CEM), Three years, from time of randomization|Response After Induction Therapy, Per the International Response Criteria: measurable tumor defined as product of longest x widest perpendicular diameter. Elevated catecholamine levels, tumor cell invasion of bone marrow also considered measurable tumor. Complete Response (CR)-no evidence of primary tumor or metastases. Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)-\>90% reduction of primary tumor; no metastases; no new bone lesions, all pre-existing lesions improved. Partial Response (PR)-50-90% reduction of primary tumor; \>50% reduction in measurable sites of metastases; 0-1 bone marrow samples with tumor; number of positive bone sites decreased by \>50%. Mixed Response (MR)-\>50% reduction of any measurable lesion (primary or metastases) with \<50% reduction in other sites; no new lesions; \<25% increase in any existing lesion.
