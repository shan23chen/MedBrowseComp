PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date - randomization date +1)/30.44. Objective progression was defined as a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the diameters of target measurable lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 millimeter (mm) or clear progression of pre-existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of any new clear lesions., Randomization to objective progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (up to 35 months)","Overall Survival (OS), OS (in months) was defined as the duration from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause.

No new lesions., Randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response (up to 35 months)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at Week 12 Based on IRR, Disease control rate at week 12 is defined as the percent of participants with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) at week 12 according to RECIST v1.1 determined by IRR. The best response of SD would be assigned if SD criteria was met at least once after randomization at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR: \>=30% decrease taking as reference the baseline sum of lesion dimensions.
