For patients with no recorded postbaseline tumor assessments, irPFS is censored at randomization. Participant who die without reported irPD are considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those who remain alive and have no irPD, irPFS is censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment.

For participants with no recorded postbaseline tumor assessment, PFS was censored at the day of randomization. A participant who died without reported prior progression was considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those who remain alive and have not progressed, PFS was censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. Independent review committee performed tumor assessment., Randomization date to date of progression or death (of censored, maximum reached: 13.6 months)|Overall Survival in Participants With NSCLC, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death.

CR=Complete disappearance of all index lesions; PR=decrease from baseline of \>=50% in the sum of products of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions.

For those participants who remain alive and did progress following response, irDoR was censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. By mWHO criteria, DoR is defined as the time between the date of response of confirmed CR or PR and the date of PD or death, whichever occurs first.
