NCT00006734,Comparison of Combination Chemotherapy Regimens in Treating Patients With Ewing's Sarcoma or Neuroectodermal Tumor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00006734,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen combined with radiation therapy and/or surgery is more effective in treating Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different chemotherapy regimens combined with radiation therapy and/or surgery in treating patients who have Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.",NO,Sarcoma,BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: ifosfamide|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|PROCEDURE: neoadjuvant therapy|RADIATION: brachytherapy|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Event-free survival, Assessed using a two sided log rank test of 0.05., Time from study entry until disease progression, death without progression of disease, occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm or last follow-up, whichever comes first, assessed up to 5 years",,,Children's Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|SWOG Cancer Research Network,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE3,587,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AEWS0031|COG-AEWS0031|CDR0000068323|A7983,2001-05,2006-08,2023-06-30,2003-01-27,,2023-08-03,"Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|University of South Alabama Cancer Research Institute, Mobile, Alabama, 36604, United States|Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona, 85016, United States|Arizona Cancer Center at University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson, Arizona, 85724, United States|Arkansas Cancer Research Center at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Downey, California, 90242, United States|City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, 91010-3000, United States|Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093-0658, United States|Loma Linda University Cancer Institute at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, California, 92354, United States|Jonathan Jaques Children's Cancer Center at Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach, California, 90801-1428, United States|Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, 90027-0700, United States|Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, 90095-1781, United States|Children's Hospital Central California, Madera, California, 93638-8762, United States|Children's Hospital and Research Center at Oakland, Oakland, California, 94609-1809, United States|Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, 92868, United States|Children's Hospital of Orange County, Orange, California, 92868, United States|Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Sutter Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|University of California Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Kaiser Permanente Medical Center -
