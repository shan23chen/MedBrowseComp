NCT02130882,Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Benralizumab in Subjects With Hypereosinophilic Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02130882,HESIL5R,UNKNOWN,"Background:

- Eosinophils are white blood cells that help fight infections. High eosinophil levels can damage people s organs, causing hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Researchers want to study if the drug benralizumab can help people with HES.

Objective:

- To test if benralizumab can safely decrease eosinophils in people with HES.

Eligibility:

- Adults age 18-65 who have been on stable HES therapy for at least 1 month but still have symptoms and high eosinophil levels.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and urine and blood tests. They will take simple heart and lung tests.
* Participants will also have a bone marrow biopsy. A numbing medicine is injected into the outer covering of the bone. Then a needle is inserted into the bone. A fast suction movement takes bone marrow cells.
* Phase 1: Participants will randomly receive either the study drug or placebo as an injection.
* They will have daily visits for the next 3 days, then 4 weekly visits, and then 4 biweekly visits. Each time, they will have medical history, physical exam, blood tests, and a check of side effects.
* They will receive another dose of the study drug or placebo at 1 month and 2 months after the first injection.
* Phase 2 repeats the Phase 1 schedule. All participants will receive the study drug.
* At 1 visit, participants will also receive a vaccine. At 4 visits, they will repeat the heart and lung tests. They will also have one other bone marrow biopsy.
* After week 24, participants will receive the study drug either 6 times over 6 months or twice over 6 months.",YES,Respiratory System Agents|Anti-Asthmatic Agents|Hematologic Diseases|Leukocyte Disorders|Hypereosinophilia,DRUG: benralizumab|OTHER: Placebo,"Number of Participants With 50% Reduction in Peripheral Blood Eosinophilia, 50% reduction in peripheral blood eosinophilia on stable HES background therapy at 12 weeks post-initiation of study drug, 3 months","Percent Reduction in Eosinophil Count, Percent reduction in peripheral blood eosinophilia at 12 weeks post-treatment, 3 months",,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),AstraZeneca,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,20,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",140081,2014-05-19,2020-06-01,2023-12-31,2014-05-06,2022-02-08,2022-02-08,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/82/NCT02130882/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
