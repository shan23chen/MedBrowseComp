NCT02614794,A Study of Tucatinib vs. Placebo in Combination With Capecitabine & Trastuzumab in Patients With Advanced HER2+ Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02614794,HER2CLIMB,COMPLETED,"This study is being done to see if tucatinib works better than placebo to help patients who have a specific type of breast cancer called HER2 positive breast carcinoma. The breast cancer in this study is either metastatic (spread into other parts of the body) or cannot be removed completely with surgery. All patients in the study will get capecitabine and trastuzumab, two drugs that are often used to treat this cancer.

There are two parts to this study. The first part of the study is already complete. Patients were randomly assigned to get either tucatinib or placebo (a pill with no medicine). Since this part was ""blinded,"" neither patients nor their doctors knew whether a patient got tucatinib or placebo.

The second part of the study is called the Unblinded Phase. In this part of the study, participants and their doctors know which drugs are being given. Participants who used to get or are currently getting placebo may be able to start taking tucatinib instead.

Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Patients will swallow tucatinib pills two times every day. They will swallow capecitabine pills two times a day during the first two weeks of each cycle. Patients will get trastuzumab injections from the study site staff on the first day of every cycle.",YES,HER2 Positive Breast Cancer,DRUG: tucatinib|DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: trastuzumab|DRUG: placebo,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST 1.1 as Determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression., 34.6 months","PFS in Patients With Brain Metastases at Baseline Using RECIST 1.1 as Determined by BICR, Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression., 34.6 months|Overall Survival (OS) at Time of Primary Analysis, Defined as time from randomization to death from any cause, 35.9 months|Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Determined by BICR, Defined as achieving a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR)., 34.6 months|ORR Per RECIST 1.1 as Determined by Investigator Assessment, Defined as achieving a best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR., 34.6 months|PFS Per RECIST 1.1 as Determined by Investigator Assessment at Time of Primary Analysis, Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression, 34.6 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Determined by BICR, Defined as the time from the first objective response to documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 24.6 months|DOR Per RECIST 1.1 as Determined by Investigator Assessment, Defined as the time from the first objective response to documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 33.2 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) as Determined by BICR Per RECIST 1.1, Clinical benefit was defined as achieving stable disease (SD) or non-complete response (CR)/non-progressive disease (PD) for at least 6 months or a best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed partial response (PR)., 34.6 months|CBR Per RECIST 1.1 as Determined by Investigator Assessment, Clinical benefit was defined as achieving stable disease (SD) or non-CR/non-PD for at least 6 months or a best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR., 34.6 months|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) at Time of Primary Analysis, As determined by assessment of AEs, clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs measurements.
