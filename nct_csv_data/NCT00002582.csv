NCT00002582,"Tamoxifen, Ovarian Ablation, and/or Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00002582,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen. Combination chemotherapy uses different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining hormone therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of tamoxifen with or without chemotherapy and/or ovarian ablation in treating women with stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: CMF regimen|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: goserelin acetate|DRUG: leuprolide acetate|DRUG: methotrexate|DRUG: tamoxifen citrate|PROCEDURE: oophorectomy|RADIATION: radiation therapy,,,,"Institute of Cancer Research, United Kingdom",Cancer Research Campaign Clinical Trials Centre|Scottish Cancer Therapy Network|Yorkshire Regional Clinical Trials Research Unit,FEMALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,6000,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCRI-ABC|CDR0000063697|CRC-TU-BR3010|SCTN-BR9401/BR9402|YRCO-ABC|EU-94029|UKCCCR-ABC,1993-06,,2007-04,2003-07-08,,2013-08-02,"Cancer Research Campaign Trials Unit-Birmingham (CRCTU), Birmingham, England, B15 2TT, United Kingdom|Beatson Oncology Centre, Glasgow, Scotland, G11 6NT, United Kingdom",
