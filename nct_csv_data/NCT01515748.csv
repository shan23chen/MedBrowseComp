- To compare the 3-year progression free survival (PFS) in the two treatment arms.

Secondary Objectives:

* Overall survival (OS).
* Postoperative pathological stage and R0 (complete) resection rate.
* Safety: Toxicities associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, morbidity/mortality, toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy.",YES,Gastric Cancer,"DRUG: Docetaxel (XRP6976)|DRUG: Oxaliplatin (SR96669)|DRUG: S-1 (1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil + 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) (Gimeracil) + Oxo (Oteracil)","Percentage of Participants With 3-Year Progression-Free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)1.1, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression, or recurrence or death. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as follows: 1) In Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy +Surgery +Adjuvant Chemotherapy (CSC) Arm, PD was determined according to the RECIST 1.1 Criteria during the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy period; 2) Irrespective of curative resection, if an intraoperative distant metastasis was observed or a distant metastasis was reported from pathology, it was considered PD; 3) If residual cancer cells were visually identified at the resection margin during surgery but could not be completely resected (R2), it was considered PD; 4) If residual cancer cells were finally confirmed at the resection margin during postoperative histology (R1), it was considered PD; 5) In case of finding a recurrence/distant metastasis or a new lesion during follow-up after R0 complete resection, it was defined as the first tumor assessment date when it was observed., 3 years","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.
