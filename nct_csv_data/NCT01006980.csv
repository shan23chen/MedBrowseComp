NCT01006980,A Study of Vemurafenib (RO5185426) in Comparison With Dacarbazine in Previously Untreated Patients With Metastatic Melanoma (BRIM 3),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01006980,,COMPLETED,"This randomized, open-label study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of vemurafenib (RO5185426) as compared to dacarbazine in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients were randomized to receive either vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Study treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients in the dacarbazine group be allowed to cross over to receive vemurafenib, and the protocol was amended accordingly on January 14, 2011, as both overall survival and progression-free survival endpoints had met the prespecified criteria for statistical significance in favor of vemurafenib.",YES,Malignant Melanoma,DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Dacarbazine,"Overall Survival, An Overall survival event was defined as death due to any cause. The number of participants with overall survival events is reported., From randomization (initiated January 2010) to December 30 2010. Median follow-up time in the vemurafenib group was 3.75 months (range 0.3 to 10.8) and in the dacarbazine group was 2.33 months (range <0.1 to 10.3).|Progression-free Survival, A progression-free survival (PFS) event was defined as disease progression or death due to any cause. Tumor response (progression) was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria using computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., From randomization (initiated January 2010) to December 30 2010.","Participants With a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response or Partial Response, BOR was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Participants who never received study treatment and treated participants without any post-baseline tumor assessments were considered as non-responders. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions and no new lesion. Any pathological lymph nodes must have had reduction in the short axis to \<10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion and no new lesion., From randomization (initiated January 2010) until December 30, 2010|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time between the date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of disease progression or death due to any cause. Duration of response was calculated only for participants who had a best overall response of Complete Response or Partial Response and was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization (initiated in January 2010) until December 30, 2010.|Time to Confirmed Response, Time to response was defined as the time from randomization to confirmed response (complete response or partial response)., From randomization (initiated January 2010) until December 30, 2010.|Time to Treatment Failure, Treatment failure was defined as a secondary endpoint in the protocol, defined as death, disease progression or premature withdrawal of study treatment. This endpoint was not included in the Statistical analysis plan; therefore no analyses of time to treatment failure were performed., approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), The intensity of AEs was graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE) on a five-point scale (Grade 1 to 5: Mild, Moderate, Severe, Life-threatening and Death). A serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution, for example is life-threatening, requires hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above., From randomization (initiated January 2010) until December 30, 2010.|Pre and Post-dose Plasma Vemurafenib Concentration by Study Day, The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib were assessed at the beginning of each 21-day cycle using pre-dose and 2-4 hours post-dose sampling., Plasma samples were collected before the morning dose (troughs) and 2-4 hours after the morning dose at the beginning of each cycle (Days 1, 22, 43, 64, 106, 148 and 190).",,Hoffmann-La Roche,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,675,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NO25026|2009-012293-12,2010-01,2010-12,2015-07,2009-11-03,2011-11-16,2016-09-28,"Birmingham, Alabama, 35243, United States|Tucson, Arizona, 85724, United States|Los Angeles, California, 90095-1752, United States|San Francisco, California, 94117, United States|Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|St Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|New York, New York, 10016, United States|New York, New York, 10065, United States|Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27514, United States|Portland, Oregon, 97213, United States|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213-2584, United States|Nashville, Tennessee, 37203, United States|Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|Salt Lake City, Utah, 84112, United States|Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|Brisbane, 4006, Australia|Frankston, 3199, Australia|Malvern, 3144, Australia|Melbourne, 3002, Australia|Melbourne, 3128, Australia|Nedlands, 6009, Australia|Newcastle, 2310, Australia|St Leonards, 2065, Australia|Sydney, 2060, Australia|Westmead, 2145, Australia|Woolloongabba, 4102, Australia|Edmonton, Alberta, T5J 3N4, Canada|Winnipeg, Manitoba, R2H 2A6, Canada|Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 5C2, Canada|Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1A1, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, H3T 1E2, Canada|Quebec City, Quebec, G1R 2J6, Canada|Bordeaux, 33075, France|Lille, 59037, France|Marseille, 13005, France|Montpellier, 34298, France|Nantes, 44093, France|Nice, 06202, France|Paris, 75010, France|Pierre Benite, 69495, France|Rouen, 76031, France|Villejuif, 94805, France|Buxtehude, 21614, Germany|Dresden, 01307, Germany|Erfurt, 99089, Germany|Essen, 45122, Germany|Frankfurt, 60596, Germany|Hannover, 30449, Germany|Heidelberg, 69120, Germany|Jena, 07743, Germany|Kiel, 24105, Germany|Koeln, 50924, Germany|Leipzig, 04103, Germany|Mainz, 55131, Germany|Minden, 32429, Germany|Muenchen, 81377, Germany|Regensburg, 93053, Germany|Tuebingen, 72076, Germany|Wuerzburg, 80337, Germany|Jerusalem, 91200, Israel|Ramat Gan, 52621, Israel|Tel Aviv, 64239, Israel|Bari, 70124, Italy|Genova, 16132, Italy|Milano, 20133, Italy|Milano, 20141, Italy|Milano, 20162, Italy|Napoli, 80131, Italy|Roma, 00158, Italy|Siena, 53100, Italy|Amsterdam, 1066 CX, Netherlands|Amsterdam, 1081 HV, Netherlands|Groningen, 9713 GZ, Netherlands|Auckland, New Zealand|Dunedin, 9001, New Zealand|Hamilton, 2001, New Zealand|Palmerston North, New Zealand|Wellington, 6021, New Zealand|Linkoeping, 58185, Sweden|Lund, 22185, Sweden|Stockholm, 17176, Sweden|Umeå, Sweden|Uppsala, 75185, Sweden|Lausanne, 1011, Switzerland|Zürich, 8091, Switzerland|Cambridge, CB2 2QH, United Kingdom|Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, United Kingdom|Glasgow, G12 0YN, United Kingdom|London, E1 1BB, United Kingdom|London, NW3 2QG, United Kingdom|London, SE1 9RT, United Kingdom|London, SW3 3JJ, United Kingdom|Manchester, M20 4BX, United Kingdom|Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE7 7DN, United Kingdom|Northwood, HA6 2RN, United Kingdom|Nottingham, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom|Oxford, OX3 7LJ, United Kingdom|Southampton, SO16 6YD, United Kingdom|Sutton, SM2 5PT, United Kingdom|Swansea, SA2 8QA, United Kingdom",
