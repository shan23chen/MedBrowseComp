This was determined by establishing the smallest optotypes that could be identified correctly by the participant at a given observation distance. Snellen visual acuity was reported as a Snellen fraction (m/M) in which the numerator (m) indicated the test distance and the denominator (M) indicated the distance at which the gap of the equivalent Landolt ring subtends 1 minute of arc. The LogMAR score was calculated as - log(m/M). The maximum increase in score of \<= 0, 0 to \< 0.1, 0.1 to \< 0.2, 0.2 to \< 0.3 and \>=0.3 relative to baseline in LogMAR were reported in this endpoint., From start of study treatment until 30 days post last dose of study treatment (for triplet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 277.4 weeks; for doublet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 268 weeks; for Control arm: maximum treatment exposure of 108 weeks)|Phase 3: Number of Participants With Shifts in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) From Baseline to Maximum Grade On-treatment, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) abnormalities were defined according to CTCAE version 4.03 where Grade 0: Non-missing value below Grade 2, Grade 2: LVEF between 40% and 50% or absolute change from baseline between -10% and \< -20%, Grade 3: LVEF between 20% and 39% or absolute change from baseline \<= -20%, Grade 4: LVEF lower than 20%.
