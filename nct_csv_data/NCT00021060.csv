NCT00021060,"Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Advanced, Metastatic, or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00021060,,COMPLETED,"Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Combining chemotherapy with a monoclonal antibody may kill more tumor cells. This randomized phase II/III trial is to see if combination chemotherapy works better with or without bevacizumab in treating patients who have advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non-small cell lung cance",NO,Adenocarcinoma of the Lung|Bronchoalveolar Cell Lung Cancer|Large Cell Lung Cancer|Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: carboplatin|BIOLOGICAL: bevacizumab|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis,"Survival, Analyses will be based on repeated confidence intervals for the hazard ratio, using O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries corresponding to a one-sided, 2.5% overall type I error. The confidence interval will be calculated on the log hazard ratio scale based on the log hazard ratio and variance estimates from the Cox partial likelihood, using the large sample normal approximation, and then the interval will be transformed to the hazard ratio scale., Up to 5 years|Grade 4 or 5 toxicities assessed using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, After each episode, the two treatment arms will be compared with respect to these events using a Fisher's exact test with two sided p-value 0.05., Up to 5 years",,,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,842,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2012-02947|E4599|U10CA021115|CDR0000068744,2002-08,2006-09,,2003-01-27,,2013-02-27,"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States",
