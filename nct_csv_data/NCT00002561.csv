NCT00002561,Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Hodgkin's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00002561,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one drug or combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with stage I or stage IIA Hodgkin's disease.",NO,Hodgkin Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: bleomycin sulfate|DRUG: dacarbazine|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: vinblastine|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Survival, 12 year survival comparison, 12 years","Freedom from progression, 12 years|Complete response rate, 12 years|Second disease progression rate, 5 and 10 years|Cause-specific survival rate, treatment-related toxicity and Quality of Life., 5 and 10 years",,NCIC Clinical Trials Group,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,405,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,HD6|CAN-NCIC-HD6|E-JHD06|NCI-V94-0427|CDR0000063481,1994-01-25,2011-08-15,2012-01-06,2003-11-21,,2020-04-14,"Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|BCCA - Vancouver Island Cancer Centre, Victoria, British Columbia, V8R 6V5, Canada|The Vitalite Health Network - Dr. Leon Richard, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 8X3, Canada|Regional Health Authority B, Zone 2, Saint John, New Brunswick, E2L 4L2, Canada|Dr. H.
