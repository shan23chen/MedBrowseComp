NCT00934544,Controlled Myelofibrosis Study With Oral Janus-associated Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor Treatment-II: The COMFORT-II Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00934544,,COMPLETED,"This was an open label, randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of randomized 2:1 Ruxolitinib tablets versus best-available therapy, as selected by the investigator. The purpose was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Ruxolitinib (INC424/INCB018424) given twice daily to the best-available therapy, in subjects with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF).",YES,Myelofibrosis,DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: Best Available Therapy (BAT),"Percentage of Participants With at Least 35% Reduction in Spleen Volume From Baseline at Week 48, The change in spleen volume from baseline to week 48 was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or by computer tomography (CT) for participants unable to undergo MRI) and was calculated only for participants who had an evaluable spleen volume at baseline. The percentage of participants achieving a greater than or equal to 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 48 was then calculated by treatment group., Baseline, Week 48","Duration of Maintenance of Spleen Volume Reduction (Median), DoMSR is defined as the interval between the first spleen volume measurement that is \>=35% reduction from baseline and the first scan that is no longer = 35% reduction AND that is a \>25% increase over nadir. It was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate for each treatment arm. The analysis was performed only for subjects who achieved greater than 35% reduction in spleen volume., Baseline, up to Year 5|Duration of Maintenance of Spleen Volume Reduction (Kaplan-Meier Estimates), This is defined as the interval between randomization and date of the first MRI showing a 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume. The analysis was performed for participants who achieved a 35% reduction in spleen volume., Baseline, up to Year 5|Percentage of Participants With at Least 35% Reduction in Spleen Volume From Baseline at Week 24, The change in spleen volume from baseline to week 24 was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or by computer tomography (CT) for participants unable to undergo MRI) and was calculated only for participants who had an evaluable spleen volume at baseline. The percentage of participants achieving a greater than or equal to 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 24 was then calculated by treatment group., Baseline, Week 24|Time to First at Least 35% Reduction in Spleen Volume From Baseline by Treatment (Primary Analysis), This is defined as the interval between randomization and date of the first MRI showing at least 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume. The analysis was performed for participants who achieved a 35% reduction in spleen volume, Time from randomization and date of the first MRI showing at least 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Median of time progression free survival (95% CI), years, Time from randomization and the earliest of either increase in spleen volume >=25% from on-study nadir, splenic irradiation, splenectomy, leukemic transformation or death|Leukemia-free Survival (LFS), Time from randomization and earliest of either (1) date of bone marrow blast count of 20% or greater; (2) date of first peripheral blast count of 20% or greater that was subsequently confirmed to sustain for at least 8 weeks; (3) date of death from any cause, Time from randomization and earliest of either leukemia or death|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the interval between randomization and the date of the bone marrow blast count of 20% or greater OR the date of the first peripheral blast count of 20% or greater that was subsequently confirmed to have been sustained for at least 8 weeks OR the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first. OS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates for each treatment arm. The estimates were supplemented by tables of number of events and probability estimates at several timepoints, From randomization until death from any cause|Percentage of Participants With Bone Marrow Histomorphology at Week 48 (Primary Analysis), This was noted as fibrosis density and was tabulated by fibrosis grade at baseline and at week 48 (post-baseline). Descriptive statistics (participant percentages) were used.

Fibrosis grades: 0 Scattered linear reticulin with no intersections corresponding to normal bone marrow ; 1 Loose network of reticulin with many intersections, especially in perivascular areas; 2 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections, occasionally with only focal bundles of collagen and/or focal osteosclerosis; 3 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections with coarse bundles of collagen, often associated with significant osteosclerosis, 48 weeks|Bone Marrow Histomorphology, Shift table from baseline to last available postbaseline fibrosis grade by treatment

The grade gives an indication of the activity or amount of inflammation and the stage represents the amount of fibrosis or scarring. The grade is assigned a number based on the degree of inflammation, which is usually scored from 0-4 with 0 being no activity and 3 or 4 considered severe activity, Baseline, once a year|Duration of Follow-up by Treatment, Number of Participants with duration of Follow up, baseline, 260 weeks (end of study)",,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,219,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CINC424A2352|CINCB 18424-352|2009-009858-24,2009-07-01,2015-03-04,2015-03-04,2009-07-08,2012-05-30,2019-08-19,"Novartis Investigative Site, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria|Novartis Investigative Site, Linz, 4010, Austria|Novartis Investigative Site, Salzburg, 5020, Austria|Novartis Investigative Site, Vienna, A-1090, Austria|Novartis Investigative Site, Antwerp, 2020, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Antwerp, 2060, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Brugge, 8000, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Brussel, 1200, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Hasselt, 3500, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Kortrijk, 8500, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, La Louvière, 7100, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Roeselare, 8800, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Yvoir, 5530, Belgium|Novartis Investigative Site, Amiens cedex 1, 80054, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Caen Cedex, 14033, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Grenoble, 38043, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Lens Cedex, 62307, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Lille, 59037, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Lyon, 69437, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Marseille, 13273, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Nimes, 30029, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Paris, 75010, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Paris, 75012, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Paris, 75014, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Pessac, 33600, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Poitiers Cedex, 86021, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Rennes, F-35043, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Strasbourg, 67091, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Toulouse Cedex, 31059, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Villejuif Cedex, 94805, France|Novartis Investigative Site, Berlin, 13353, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Frankfurt/M, 60590, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Köln, 50937, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Mainz, 55131, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Muenster, 48149, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Stuttgart, 70376, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Tuebingen, 72076, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Ulm, 89081, Germany|Novartis Investigative Site, Pavia, (pv), 27100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Monza, MB, 20900, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Milano, MI, 20162, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Florence, 50134, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Orbassano, 10043, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Pavia, 27100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Amsterdam, 1081, Netherlands|Novartis Investigative Site, Den Haag, 2545 CH, Netherlands|Novartis Investigative Site, Groningen, 9713 GZ, Netherlands|Novartis Investigative Site, Maastricht, 5800, Netherlands|Novartis Investigative Site, Nijmegen, 6500 MB, Netherlands|Novartis Investigative Site, Rotterdam, 3015 CE, Netherlands|Novartis Investigative Site, Barcelona, Catalunya, 08036, Spain|Novartis Investigative Site, Valencia, Comunidad Valenciana, 46010, Spain|Novartis Investigative Site, Majadahonda, Madrid, 28222, Spain|Novartis Investigative Site, Göteborg, SE-413 45, Sweden|Novartis Investigative Site, Stockholm, SE-118 83, Sweden|Novartis Investigative Site, Belfast, BT9 7AB, United Kingdom|Novartis Investigative Site, Cambridge, CB2 2QQ, United Kingdom|Novartis Investigative Site, London, SE1 9RT, United Kingdom|Novartis Investigative Site, Oxford, OX37LJ, United Kingdom",
