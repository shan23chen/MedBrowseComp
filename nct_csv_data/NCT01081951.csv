NCT01081951,"Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Olaparib When Given in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel, Compared With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01081951,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,To compare the efficacy of olaparib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin (AUC4) when compared with carboplatin (AUC6) and paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.,YES,Ovarian Cancer,DRUG: olaparib|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: Drug: carboplatin,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS (based on independent central review) was defined as the time from randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 (≥20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions from minimum, clinically significant progression in non-target lesions or the presence of a new lesion) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression)., Radiologic scans performed at weeks 9 and 18 (+/-1 week) and every 12 weeks thereafter relative to the date of randomisation until the primary analysis (approximately 20 months)","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomisation until death by any cause. Patients who had not died at the time of analysis were censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive. Updated OS based on final OS analysis (DCO 31 January 2014), Following disease progression, patients will be contacted every 12 weeks to assess survival status until the final analysis (approximately 50 months)|Percentage Change in Tumour Size, The total tumour size was defined as the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions. At week 9, the percentage change in tumour size was calculated as \[(week 9 sum of target lesions - baseline sum of target lesions)/baseline sum of target lesions\]\*100 for each patient. Imputations were used for missing data where possible., Week 9 (+/- 1 week)",,AstraZeneca,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,162,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,D0810C00041|2009-015970-36,2010-02-04,2011-10-10,2025-12-31,2010-03-05,2012-12-10,2025-03-25,"Research Site, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Research Site, West Hollywood, California, 90048, United States|Research Site, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Research Site, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|Research Site, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Research Site, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Research Site, New York, New York, 10016, United States|Research Site, Portland, Oregon, 97227-1191, United States|Research Site, Parkville, 3050, Australia|Research Site, Randwick, 2031, Australia|Research Site, Brussels, 1090, Belgium|Research Site, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Research Site, Namur, 5000, Belgium|Research Site, Wilrijk, 2610, Belgium|Research Site, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|Research Site, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 5C2, Canada|Research Site, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Research Site, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Research Site, Sherbrooke, Quebec, J1H 5N4, Canada|Research Site, Quebec, G1R 2J6, Canada|Research Site, Brno, 625 00, Czechia|Research Site, Brno, 656 53, Czechia|Research Site, Hradec Kralove, 500 05, Czechia|Research Site, Olomouc, 775 20, Czechia|Research Site, Praha 2, 120 00, Czechia|Research Site, Essen, 45147, Germany|Research Site, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany|Research Site, Hamburg, 20246, Germany|Research Site, München, 81675, Germany|Research Site, Solingen, 42653, Germany|Research Site, Genova, 16132, Italy|Research Site, Milan, 20141, Italy|Research Site, Monza, 20052, Italy|Research Site, Torino, 10126, Italy|Research Site, Chuo-ku, 104-0045, Japan|Research Site, Fukuoka-shi, 811-1395, Japan|Research Site, Matsuyama-shi, 791-0280, Japan|Research Site, Morioka-shi, 028-3695, Japan|Research Site, Shinjuku-ku, 160-8582, Japan|Research Site, Yamagata-shi, 990-9585, Japan|Research Site, Yonago-shi, 683-8504, Japan|Research Site, Amsterdam, 1066 CX, Netherlands|Research Site, Amsterdam, 1105 AZ, Netherlands|Research Site, Nijmegen, 6525 GA, Netherlands|Research Site, Rotterdam, 3015 GD, Netherlands|Research Site, Ciudad de Panama, 2723, Panama|Research Site, Lima, LIMA 27, Peru|Research Site, Lima, LIMA 41, Peru|Research Site, Madrid, 08035, Spain|Research Site, Valencia, 46010, Spain|Research Site, Birmingham, B18 7QH, United Kingdom|Research Site, Coventry, CV2 2DX, United Kingdom|Research Site, Edinburgh, EH4 2XR, United Kingdom",
