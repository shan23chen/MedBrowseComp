PR: ≥ 50% reduction, compared to baseline, in the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters for all measurable lesions for at least 4 weeks, no progression of nonmeasureable disease, no new lesions, and stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions. Patient must be on a corticosteroid dose not greater than the dose at the time of baseline scan and be stable or improving clinically.
