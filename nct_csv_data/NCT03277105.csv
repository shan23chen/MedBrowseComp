NCT03277105,A Study of Subcutaneous Versus (vs.) Intravenous Administration of Daratumumab in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03277105,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to show that subcutaneous (SC) administration of daratumumab co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (Dara SC) is non-inferior to intravenous (IV) administration of daratumumab (Dara IV) in terms of the overall response rate (ORR) and maximum trough concentration (Ctrough).,YES,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Dara SC|DRUG: Dara IV,"Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved partial response (PR) or better according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, during or after study treatment. IMWG criteria for PR: greater than or equal to (\>=) 50 percent (%) reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to less than (\<) 200 milligrams (mg)/24 hours, If the serum and urine M-proteins are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels were required in place of the M-protein criteria, If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay was also not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow plasma cells (PCs) was required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was \>=30%. In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, a \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas was also required., Up to 1 year 8 months|Maximum Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Daratumumab, Maximum Ctrough was defined as the serum predose concentration of daratumumab on Cycle 3 Day 1., Predose on Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle of 28 days)","Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Infusion-related Reactions (IRR), Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent infusion-related reactions were reported., Up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as time from date of randomization to either progression of disease (PD), death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. IMWG criteria for PD: Increase of 25% from lowest response value in any one of the following: Serum M component (absolute increase must be \>=0.5 gram per deciliter (g/dL), Urine M-component (absolute increase must be \>=200 mg/24 hours), Participants without measurable serum and urine Mprotein levels: difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels (absolute increase must be \>10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels and without measurable disease by FLC levels, bone marrow PC% (absolute percentage must be \>=10%), definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or increase in size of bone lesions or tissue plasmacytomas and development of hypercalcemia (serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to PC proliferative disorder., Up to 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better, VGPR or better was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved VGPR or better (VGPR, complete response (CR) or stringent complete response \[sCR\]), based on computerized algorithm as per IMWG criteria during or after the study treatment. IMWG criteria for VGPR: Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or \>=90 percent (%) reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein \<100 milligrams (mg)/24 hours, CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow. sCR: CR plus normal FLC ratio, and absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescencea or 2- to 4 color flow cytometry., Up to 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (Including sCR) or Better, CR or better was defined as percentage of participants with a CR or better (CR or stringent complete response \[sCR\]) based on computerized algorithm as per IMWG criteria. IMWG criteria for CR- negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \<5% PCs in bone marrow. sCR: CR plus normal FLC ratio, and absence of clonal PCs by IHC, immunofluorescencea or 2- to 4 color flow cytometry., Up to 3 years|Time to Next Therapy, Time to next therapy was defined as the time from randomization to the start of the first subsequent anti-cancer therapy., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death due to any cause., Up to 3 years|Patient-Reported Satisfaction With Therapy as Assessed With Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ), Modified-CTSQ contain 9 items (2 items for Thoughts about Cancer Therapy and 7 items in a defined domain of Satisfaction with Therapy) specific to satisfaction with therapy and for comparison of SC and IV administration. Satisfaction with therapy was calculated based on 7-items using 5-point verbal rating scale, where 1= never and 5= always. Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale; higher scores represent better health. At least 5 of the 7 items within the Satisfaction with Therapy domain had to be completed to calculate a domain score. No domain score was calculated for Thoughts about Cancer Therapy., Cycle 1 (Days 8,15 and 22), Cycle 2 (Days 1,8,15 and 22), Cycle 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 and 22 (Day 1)|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the duration from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease according to the IMWG criteria. PD was defined as an increase of 25 % from the lowest response value in one of the following: serum and urine M-component (absolute increase must be \>= 0.5 g/dL and \>=200 mg/24 hours respectively); Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be \> 10 mg/dL); Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to PC proliferative disorder., Up to 3 years|Time to Partial Response (PR) or Better, Time to PR or better was defined as the time from randomization until onset of first response of PR or better., Up to 3 years|Time to Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better, Time to VGPR or better was defined as the time from randomization until onset of first VGPR or better., Up to 3 years|Time to Complete Response (CR) or Better, Time to CR or better was defined as the time from randomization until onset of first CR or better., Up to 3 years",,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,522,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CR108342|2017-000206-38|54767414MMY3012,2017-10-27,2019-06-27,2024-01-12,2017-09-08,2020-07-27,2025-04-01,"Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215-5418, United States|Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28204, United States|Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, 2050, Australia|St Vincents Hospital Melbourne, Fitzroy, 3065, Australia|Alfred Health, Melbourne, 3004, Australia|Fiona Stanley Hospital, Murdoch, 6150, Australia|Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, 6009, Australia|Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, 2298, Australia|The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville South, 5011, Australia|Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, 4102, Australia|Fundacao Pio XII, Barretos, 14784-400, Brazil|Centro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Oncologia de Santa Catarina CEPEN, Florianopolis, 88034-000, Brazil|Fundacao Doutor Amaral Carvalho, Jau, 17210 080, Brazil|Instituto Joinvilense de Hematologia e Oncologia Ltda Centro de Hematologia e Oncologia, Joinville, 89201-260, Brazil|Associacao Hospitalar Beneficente Sao Vicente de Paulo - Hospital Sao Vicente de Paulo, Passo Fundo, 99010-090, Brazil|Hospital das Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, 90035-903, Brazil|Instituto de Educacao, Pesquisa e Gestao em Saude, Rio de Janeiro, 22775-001, Brazil|CEHON, Salvador, 45995-000, Brazil|Fundacao Faculdade Regional de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto Hospital de Base, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, 15090-000, Brazil|Clinica Sao Germano, São Paulo, 01455 010, Brazil|Hospital Das Clinicas Da Faculdade De Medicina Da USP, São Paulo, 05403-010, Brazil|Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|The Gordon & Leslie Diamond Health Care Center, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 1M9, Canada|QEII Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1V7, Canada|Victoria Hospital, London, Ontario, N6A 5W9, Canada|Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X6, Canada|CHU de Quebec L Hotel Dieu de Quebec, Québec, Quebec, G1R 2J6, Canada|Fakultni nemocnice Brno, Brno, 625 00, Czechia|Fakultni nemocnice Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, 500 05, Czechia|Fakultni nemocnice Olomouc, Olomouc, 779 00, Czechia|Fakultni Nemocnice Ostrava, Ostrava, 70852, Czechia|Fakultni nemocnice Plzen, Hemato-onkologicke oddeleni, Plzen, 323 00, Czechia|Fakultni nemocnice Kralovske Vinohrady, Praha 10, 100 34, Czechia|Vseobecna fakultni nemocnice v Praze - I. interni klinika - klinika hematologie, Praha 2, 128 08, Czechia|CHU Caen - Côte de Nacre, Caen, 14033, France|Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille Cedex, 59000, France|CHU de Nantes hotel Dieu, Nantes Cedex 1, 44093, France|CHU de Boreaux, Pessac, 33604, France|Centre hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-Bénite, 69495, France|CHU Poitiers - Hopital la Miletrie, Poitiers, 86021, France|CHU Nancy Brabois, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, 54511, France|Alexandra General Hospital of Athens, Athens Attica, 115 28, Greece|Hillel Yaffe Medical Center - Oncology, Hadera, 38100, Israel|Rambam Med.Center - Hematology Institute, Haifa, 31096, Israel|Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, 3436212, Israel|Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, 91120, Israel|Rabin Medical Center Beilinson Campus, Petah Tikva, 49100, Israel|Sheba Medical Center Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, 52621, Israel|Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, 64239, Israel|Policlinico Sant'Orsola Malpighi, Bologna, 40138, Italy|Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, 20133, Italy|Ospedale Villa Sofia-Cervello, Palermo, 90146, Italy|Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, 27100, Italy|Azienda USL di Piacenza, Piacenza, 29121, Italy|Università di Roma La Sapienza, Roma, 00161, Italy|Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli, Roma, 00168, Italy|A.O.U.
