NCT02979691,Phase II/III Study Comparing Chemoradiotherapy With Radiotherapy in Elderly Patients With Esophageal or Esophagogastric Cancer - 3JECROG P-01,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02979691,,COMPLETED,Ratiotherapy alone is the current standard treatment for elderly esophageal or esophagogastric cancer in China. And Little is known about chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in elderly patients. This study aimed to assess the efficiency and safety of simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with S1 based SIB-IMRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with S1 in in elderly (age â‰¥70 years) esophageal or esophagogastric cancer patients,NO,Esophagus Cancer|Esophagogastric Junction Cancer|Radiotherapy; Complications|Chemoradiation,RADIATION: SIB-IMRT|DRUG: S-1,"Overall survival, 1 year","Comprehensive geriatric assessment, A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidisciplinary evaluation in which multiple problems of older persons are described.It consists several questionnaires used to assess an older individual's functional status,comorbid medical condition,cognition, psychologic state, social support, and nutritional status,etc., Baseline|Remission rate of dysphagia, Change from baseline to 1 month after treatment|Progression free survival, 1 year|Time of locoregional control and failure site within or outside radiation field, 1 year|Radiotherapy toxicities, 2 months|Chemoradiotherapy toxicities, 2 months","Analysis of relationship between dosimetric parameters of radiation technique and acute or late side effects, 6 months|CT/MRI Texture Features in evaluating the tumor response and prognosis, Change from baseline to 1 month after treatment|Clinical target contouring guided by MRI or CT simulation, Baseline",Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Hebei Medical University Fourth Hospital|Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital|Anyang Tumor Hospital|The First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University|Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University|Fujian Cancer Hospital|Tengzhou Central People's Hospital|The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University|The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University|Sichuan Cancer Hospital and Research Institute,ALL,OLDER_ADULT,PHASE2|PHASE3,350,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,3JECROG P-01,2016-10,2020-04,2020-04,2016-12-02,,2020-07-21,"Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Hospital, National Cancer Center, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, 100021, China",
