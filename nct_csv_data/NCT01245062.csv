NCT01245062,GSK1120212 vs Chemotherapy in Advanced or Metastatic BRAF V600E/K Mutation-positive Melanoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01245062,,COMPLETED,"This is a two-arm, open-label, randomized Phase III study comparing single agent GSK1120212 to chemotherapy (either dacarbazine or paclitaxel) in subjects with Stage IIIc or Stage IV malignant cutaneous melanoma. All subjects must have a BRAF mutation-positive tumour sample. Subjects who have received up to one prior regimen of chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic melanoma setting will be enrolled into the study. Subjects with any prior BRAF or MEK inhibitor use will be excluded. Approximately 297 subjects will be enrolled with 2:1 randomization (198 subjects into the GSK1120212 arm and 99 subjects into the chemotherapy arm). The primary endpoint for the statistical analysis will be a comparison of progression free survival for subjects receiving GSK1120212 compared to chemotherapy. Subjects who have progression on chemotherapy will be offered the option to receive GSK1120212.",YES,Melanoma,DRUG: GSK1120212|DRUG: Chemotherapy,"Progression-free Survival in BRAF V600E Mutation-positive Participants Without a History of Brain Metastases as Assessed by the Investigator and Independent Review, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of disease progression (PD) or death. PFS for investigator-assessed and blinded, independent, central review committee (BRIC)-assessed responses was summarized per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1, which is a set of published rules defining when cancer participants improve (respond), stay the same (stabilize), or worsen (progress) during treatment.
