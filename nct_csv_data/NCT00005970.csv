NCT00005970,"Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, Cyclophosphamide, and Pacltaxel With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With HER2-Positive Node-Positive or High-Risk Node-Negative Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00005970,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial studies doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating women with breast cancer that is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and has spread to the lymph nodes or high-risk and has not spread to the lymph nodes. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without trastuzumab in treating breast cancer.",NO,Breast Adenocarcinoma|HER2 Positive Breast Carcinoma|Stage IA Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IB Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIA Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIB Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIIA Breast Cancer AJCC v7,DRUG: Aromatase Inhibition Therapy|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Tamoxifen Citrate|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab,"Duration of DFS, Will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A stratified log-rank test will be used to assess whether DFS differs with respect to the addition of trastuzumab to a chemotherapy regimen including AC and paclitaxel. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be reported for relative risks, for DFS at the 5-year point, and for absolute benefit as defined by differences in DFS and OS., Time from registration to first adverse event, assessed up to 15 years","Overall survival, Will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
