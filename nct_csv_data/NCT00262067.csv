NCT00262067,A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer (RIBBON 1),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00262067,,UNKNOWN,"This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in subjects with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer.",YES,Metastatic Breast Cancer,DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Chemotherapy,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging techniques or clinically. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions., Baseline to the data cut-off date of 31 Jul 2008 (up to 2 years, 7 months)","Objective Response as Determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), An objective response was defined as a complete response or a partial response determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart as determined by the investigator using RECIST. For target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; a partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. For non-target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions; a partial response was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions., Baseline to the data cut-off date of 31 Jul 2008 (up to 2 years, 7 months)|Duration of Objective Response as Determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first tumor assessment that led to a determination of an objective response to the time of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline to the data cut-off date of 31 Jul 2008 (up to 2 years, 7 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause., Baseline to the data cut-off of 23 Feb 2009 (up to 3 years, 2 months)|1-year Survival, 1-year survival was defined as the percentage of patients who were alive 1 year after randomization.

The percentage of patients alive at 1 year was determined using Kaplan-Meier analyses and the 95% confidence intervals were computed using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method., Baseline to the data cut-off of 23 Feb 2009 (up to 3 years, 2 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Independent Review Committee Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) as determined by the Independent Review Committee using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline to the data cut-off date of 31 Jul 2008 (up to 2 years, 7 months)",,"Genentech, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1237,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",AVF3694g|BO20094,2005-12,2008-07,2013-12,2005-12-06,2013-10-25,2013-12-13,"Fullerton, California, 92835, United States|Santa Barbara, California, 93105, United States|Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States|Sioux City, Iowa, 51101, United States|Wichita, Kansas, 67214-3728, United States|Geelong, 3220, Australia|Malvern, 3144, Australia|Melbourne, 3002, Australia|Perth, 6008, Australia|Southport, 4215, Australia|Wahroonga, 2076, Australia|Waratah, 2298, Australia|Wollongong, 2500, Australia|Porto Alegre, 91350-200, Brazil|Rio de Janeiro, 22260-020, Brazil|Salvador, 40170-110, Brazil|Santo Andre, 09060-870, Brazil|Sao Paulo, 03102-002, Brazil|Winnipeg, Manitoba, R2H 2A6, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, H2L 4M1, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, H2W 1S6, Canada|Marseille, 13273, France|Paris, 75248, France|Reims, 51100, France|Saint Herblain, 44805, France|Strasbourg, 67010, France|Athens, 11521, Greece|Hania, 73300, Greece|Heraklion, 71110, Greece|Patras, 26500, Greece|Thessaloniki, 57001, Greece|Guatemala City, 01015, Guatemala|Kyunggi-do, 411-769, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 110-744, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 120-752, Korea, Republic of|Acapulco, 39670, Mexico|Aguascalientes, 20230, Mexico|Merida, 97500, Mexico|Monterrey, 64020, Mexico|Monterrey, 64380, Mexico|Amstelveen, 1186 AH, Netherlands|Apeldoorn, 7334 DZ, Netherlands|Delft, 2600 GA, Netherlands|Oslo, 0310, Norway|Oslo, 0407, Norway|Panama City, Panama|Callao, Peru|Quezon City, 1114, Philippines|Chelyabinsk, 454 087, Russian Federation|Ivanovo, 153040, Russian Federation|Kazan, 420029, Russian Federation|Kazan, 420111, Russian Federation|Moscow, 115478, Russian Federation|Moscow, 117837, Russian Federation|Moscow, 129128, Russian Federation|Novosibirsk, 630047, Russian Federation|Obninsk, 249036, Russian Federation|Ryazan, 390011, Russian Federation|Samara, 443066, Russian Federation|St Petersburg, 197758, Russian Federation|UFA, 450054, Russian Federation|Singapore, 119228, Singapore|Singapore, 169610, Singapore|Córdoba, 14004, Spain|Elche, 03203, Spain|Girona, 17007, Spain|La Coruna, 15006, Spain|La Laguna, 38320, Spain|Madrid, 28034, Spain|Santander, 39008, Spain|Sevilla, 41013, Spain|Valencia, 46010, Spain|Zaragoza, 50009, Spain|Gaevle, 80187, Sweden|Uppsala, 751 85, Sweden|Örebro, 701 85, Sweden|Tainan, 704, Taiwan|Taoyuan, 333, Taiwan|Cherkassy, 18009, Ukraine|Dnipropetrovsk, 49102, Ukraine|Kiev, 03115, Ukraine|Lvov, 79031, Ukraine|Odessa, 65055, Ukraine|Zaporozhye, 69104, Ukraine|Chelsmford, CM1 7ET, United Kingdom|Cottingham, HU16 5JQ, United Kingdom|Epping, CM16 6TN, United Kingdom|Huddersfield, HD3 3EA, United Kingdom|Nottingham, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom|Sheffield, S1O 2SJ, United Kingdom|Swansea, SA2 8QA, United Kingdom|Montevideo, 11200, Uruguay",
