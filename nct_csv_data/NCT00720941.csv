Participants were asked to assess their worst mouth/throat, hand, and foot soreness by answering the question of "" In the past 4 weeks, what was your worst mouth/throat, hand, and foot soreness?"" by using the following 4-point scale: 0, I never had any soreness; 1, I had a little bit of soreness; 2, I had quite a lot of soreness; 3, I had severe soreness.

Participants assessed the limitations caused by their mouth/throat soreness by answering the question of ""In the past 4 weeks, how much did your worst mouth/throat soreness limit you in the following activities: swallowing/eating/drinking/talking/sleeping"" by using the following 4-point scale: 0, not limited; 1, limited a little; 2, limited a lot; 3, unable to do. The overall limitation score (15=best; 0=worst), based on the individual scores for the 5 activities, is derived as follows: the actual scores were rescored by subtracting the actual score from ""3"" for each of the 5 categories. A high score indicates less limitation. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment week value minus the Baseline value.

Participants shared their thoughts on their cancer therapy (9 questions), their satisfaction with their most recently administered cancer therapy (6 questions), and if they would take the same cancer therapy if given the choice to do so again. All questions were assessed on a 5-point scale; 1, never; 5, always. Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale; higher scores represent better treatment satisfaction., Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, respectively)|Mean Number of Non-study Medical Visits, Telephone Consultations, Hospital Days, and Emergency Room (ER) Visits Per 30 Days Through Week 24, Non-study medical visits were defined as the sum of primary care physician visits, nurse practitioner/physician's assistant/nurse visits, and medical or surgical specialist visits. Days hospitalized were defined as the sum of days in the general ward and days in intensive care. The number of telephone consultations and ER visits was assessed via individual questions on the electronic Case Report Form.
