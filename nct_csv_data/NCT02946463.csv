NCT02946463,ALXN1210 (Ravulizumab) Versus Eculizumab in Complement Inhibitor Treatment-Naïve Adult Participants With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02946463,,COMPLETED,The primary purpose of this study was to assess the noninferiority of ravulizumab compared to eculizumab in adult participants with PNH who had never been treated with a complement inhibitor (treatment-naïve).,YES,Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH),BIOLOGICAL: Ravulizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Eculizumab,"Proportion Of Participants With Normalization Of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Levels, LDH is an indicator of intravascular hemolysis that occurs in participants with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). A decrease in LDH from above the upper limit of normal (ULN) to below the ULN indicates reduction (improvement) in hemolysis. Normalization of LDH levels (LDH-N) was LDH levels less than or equal to 1 x ULN, from Day 29 through Day 183. The ULN for LDH is 246 U/L., Day 29 through Day 183|Percentage Of Participants Who Achieved Transfusion Avoidance (TA), Transfusion avoidance was defined as the percentage of participants who remained transfusion free and did not require a transfusion per protocol-specified guidelines through Day 183., Baseline through Day 183","Percentage Of Participants With Breakthrough Hemolysis (BTH), Breakthrough hemolysis was defined as at least 1 new or worsening symptom or sign of intravascular hemolysis (fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath \[dyspnea\], anemia \[hemoglobin \<10 gram/deciliter (g/dL)\], major adverse vascular event \[MAVE, including thrombosis\], dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in the presence of elevated LDH ≥2 × ULN, after prior LDH reduction to \<1.5 × ULN on therapy., Baseline through Day 183|Percent Change From Baseline In LDH Levels, Baseline is defined as the average of all available assessments of LDH levels prior to first study drug dose. Estimates are based on Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) that includes treatment group, history of transfusion (as a categorical variable based on the stratification factor levels) and baseline LDH level (as a continuous variable), study visit and study visit by treatment group interaction. An unstructured covariance structure was used., Baseline, Day 183|Change From Baseline In Quality Of Life As Assessed By The Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue, FACIT-Fatigue score ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to first dose of study drug. Estimates are based on MMRM that includes treatment group, the observed stratification randomization indicators (history of transfusion and LDH) and baseline FACIT-Fatigue level, study visit, and study visit by treatment group interaction. An unstructured covariance structure was used., Baseline, Day 183|Percentage Of Participants With Stabilized Hemoglobin Levels, Stabilized hemoglobin was defined as avoidance of a ≥2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level from baseline in the absence of transfusion through Day 183., Baseline through Day 183",,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT,
