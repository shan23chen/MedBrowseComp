NCT00003204,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003204,,COMPLETED,"Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of combination chemotherapy followed by rituximab or observation in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy, with or without rituximab, is more effective for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",NO,Stage III Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage III Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage III Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage III Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage IV Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|DRUG: prednisone|BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis,"Time to treatment failure, This comparison will be made using a one-sided logrank test with a 5% type I error rate., From maintenance randomization to the earlier of progression or death, assessed up to 5 years",,,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,515,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2012-02972|E1496|U10CA021115|CDR0000066056,1998-03,2006-05,,2003-01-27,,2013-02-27,"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States",
