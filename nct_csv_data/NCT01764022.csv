NCT01764022,A Safety and Efficacy Study of BCD-022 With Paclitaxel Compared to Herceptin With Paclitaxel in HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01764022,,COMPLETED,BCD-022-02 is a double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing efficacy of BCD-022 (INN: trastuzumab) and paclitaxel to Herceptin and paclitaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with pharmacokinetics substudy. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of efficacy and safety of BCD-022 compared to Herceptin. Also study includes pharmacokinetics assessment.,YES,Human Epithelial Receptor (HER)-2 Positive Breast Cancer,DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Overall Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.

The response was assessed at the screening, after 3 therapy cycles and after 6 therapy cycles. If CT after 3 or 6 therapy cycles revealed the complete or partial response, a confirmatory CT scan was performed 4 weeks later. The best response during the study was assessed., Day 127|Area Under the Curve After the First Test Drug Administration, Primary outcome measure for pharmacokinetics (PK) substudy.
