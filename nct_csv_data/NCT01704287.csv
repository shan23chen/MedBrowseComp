NCT01704287,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Chemotherapy in Participants With Advanced Melanoma (MK-3475-002/P08719/KEYNOTE-002),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01704287,,COMPLETED,"This study was conducted to compare survival using pembrolizumab (SCH 900475, MK-3475) or standard chemotherapy in participants with advanced melanoma (MEL) who had progressed after prior therapy.

Initial Treatment Period:

Participants were initially randomized to receive either low-dose (2 mg/kg) pembrolizumab, higher dose (10 mg/kg) pembrolizumab or Investigator-choice chemotherapy (ICC). The four standard chemotherapy choices were: carboplatin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, dacarbazine, or temozolomide. The randomization to either pembrolizumab or ICC was conducted in an open-label fashion.

The starting pembrolizumab dose was initially blinded to Investigators and participants until Amendment 03. With Amendment 03, all ongoing pembrolizumab participants were to be treated with open label, fixed dose pembrolizumab 200 mg, instead of a weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab.

Switch-to-Pembrolizumab Treatment Period:

Participants who were initially randomized to receive ICC and experienced progressive disease (PD) may have been eligible to switch to receiving pembrolizumab provided they met protocol-specified requirements for switching. Qualified participants were re-randomized to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg in a double-blind fashion. Participants who qualified to switch to pembrolizumab must have completed a washout period of ≥28 days from last dose of chemotherapy before receiving pembrolizumab. With Amendment 03, all switched-to-pembrolizumab participants were to be treated with open-label, fixed dose pembrolizumab 200 mg instead of a weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab.",YES,Malignant Melanoma,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Dacarbazine|DRUG: Temozolomide,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Initial Treatment Period, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. Analysis of PFS was based on an integrated radiology and oncology (IRO) assessment and was not planned or conducted for the switch-to-pembrolizumab treatment groups. Median PFS based on the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data is presented. This was the final analysis for PFS., Up to approximately 36 months (Through Final Analysis database cutoff date of 16-Nov-2015)|Interim Overall Survival (OS) - Initial Treatment Period, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Analysis of OS was not planned or conducted for the switch-to-pembrolizumab treatment groups. Median OS based on the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data is presented. This was the interim analysis for OS., Up to approximately 36 months (Through Final Analysis database cutoff date of 16-Nov-2015)|Final Overall Survival (OS) - Initial Treatment Period, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Analysis of OS was not planned or conducted for the switch-to-pembrolizumab treatment groups. Median OS duration based on the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data is presented. This was the final analysis for OS., Up to approximately 75 months (Through End of Trial Analysis database cutoff date of 31-Jan-2019)","Final Overall Survival (OS) By Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Expression Status - Initial Treatment Period, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants with an Allred Proportion Score (APS) ≥2 (membranous staining in ≥1% of cells for PD-L1) were considered to be PD-L1 Positive and participants with an APS of 0 or 1 were considered to be PD-L1 Negative. Analysis of OS was not planned or conducted for the switch-to-pembrolizumab treatment groups. Median OS duration based on the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data by PD-L1 tumor expression status is presented., Up to approximately 75 months (Through End of Trial Analysis database cutoff date of 31-Jan-2019)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Initial Treatment Period, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed using RECIST 1.1. Analysis of ORR was not planned or conducted for the switch-to-pembrolizumab treatment groups. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented. This was the final analysis for ORR., Up to approximately 36 months (Through Final Analysis database cutoff date of 16-Nov-2015)|Best Overall Response (BOR) - Initial Treatment Period, BOR was assessed by independent radiology review using RECIST 1.1 and was recorded from randomization until the last imaging assessment in this period. Response categories included: Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; and Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. BOR for the Initial Treatment Period was based on IRO. BOR for participants during the Initial Treatment Period is presented., Up to approximately 36 months (Through Final Analysis database cutoff date of 16-Nov-2015)|Best Overall Response (BOR) - Switch-to-Pembrolizumab Treatment Period, The BOR was assessed using RECIST 1.1 and was recorded from the start of the second line of study drug (pembrolizumab) until the last imaging assessment in this period. Response categories included: Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; and Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. For the switch-to-pembrolizumab treatment groups, BOR was based on independent review committee (IRC) assessment.
