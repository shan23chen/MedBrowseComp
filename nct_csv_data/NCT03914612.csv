NCT03914612,Testing the Addition of the Immunotherapy Drug Pembrolizumab to the Usual Chemotherapy Treatment (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin) in Stage III-IV or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03914612,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase III trial studies how well the combination of pembrolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin works compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in treating patients with endometrial cancer that is stage III or IV, or has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Paclitaxel and carboplatin are chemotherapy drugs used as part of the usual treatment approach for this type of cancer. This study aims to assess if adding immunotherapy to these drugs is better or worse than the usual approach for treatment of this cancer.",YES,Endometrial Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma|Endometrial Dedifferentiated Carcinoma|Endometrial Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma|Endometrial Mixed Cell Adenocarcinoma|Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma|Endometrial Undifferentiated Carcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Adenocarcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Carcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Dedifferentiated Carcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Mixed Cell Adenocarcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma|Recurrent Endometrial Undifferentiated Carcinoma|Stage III Uterine Corpus Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IV Uterine Corpus Cancer AJCC v8,DRUG: Carboplatin|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Paclitaxel|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|OTHER: Placebo Administration|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) Note: For arm 2 (dMMR Cohort), the point estimate and the upper limit of the confidence interval are not able to be estimated due to insufficient events., Duration of time from study entry to time of progression per RECIST criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The interquartile range for follow-up was (6.37 months, 30.62 months). The maximum for follow-up was 37.85 months.","Adverse Events With Grade 3 (or Higher), Assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V5.0). The endpoint is the count of participants with an adverse event of grade 3 (or higher) by treatment group., For the adverse event time frame, the interquartile range was (0.79 months, 3.42 months); the maximum was 28.39 months.|Objective Tumor Response, Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., For the time frame for tumor response, the interquartile range was (2.27 months, 8.66 months) and the maximum was 36.37 months.|Duration of Objective Response, The time difference between the dates of first response and first progression; patients who do not progress are considered censored. Note: for Arm 2 (dMMR Cohort), the upper limit of the confidence interval is not able to be estimated due to an insufficient number of events., For the duration of objective response, the interquartile range is (4.24 months, 7.92 months); the maximum is 28.68 months.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS).

The effectiveness of pembrolizumab will be compared by PD-L1 status (CPS). A formal test will be conducted by examining the interaction term between pembrolizumab treatment (yes or no) with PD-L1 status. The association between PD-L1 CPS status and MMR IHC status will be assessed with odds ratios. A test may be conducted with a Fisher's Exact Test, and confidence intervals will be provided., 5 years|Association Between PD-L1 IHC and MMR Status, Measures of association between PD-L1 IHC (CPS) and MMR IHC status.
