NCT00021450,Radiation Therapy With or Without Bicalutamide and Goserelin in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00021450,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Bicalutamide and goserelin may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of testosterone. It is not yet known if radiation therapy is more effective with or without bicalutamide and goserelin in treating prostate cancer.
