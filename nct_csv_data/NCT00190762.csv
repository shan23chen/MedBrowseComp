NCT00190762,A Study Comparing Pemetrexed Plus Best Supportive Care Versus Best Supportive Care Alone in the Treatment of Mesothelioma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00190762,,COMPLETED,"Based on results from earlier clinical trials, Pemetrexed may have antitumor activity as a first-line agent in the treatment of mesothelioma. Given this, it is hypothesized that Pemetrexed may be active in second-line mesothelioma in which the standard treatment is best supportive care. This study will compare survival of previously treated patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who receive Pemetrexed plus best supportive care to the survival of similar patients who receive best supportive care alone.",NO,Mesothelioma,DRUG: Pemetrexed,The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival following treatment with Pemetrexed plus best supportive care versus best supportive care alone,"To characterize and compare the toxicities of Pemetrexed/best supportive care and best supportive care alone in this patient population;to determine the objective-tumor response rate|to compare time to event efficacy variables of both arms including:duration of response,time to objective tumor response,time to treatment failure,time to documented disease progression,progression-free survival|to compare changes in the average symptom burden index between the Pemetrexed/best supportive care and best supportive care arms",,Eli Lilly and Company,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,240,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,5362|H3E-MC-JMEW,2001-10,,2005-11,2005-09-19,,2007-01-26,"For additional information regarding investigative sites for this trial, contact 1-877-CTLILLY (1-877-285-4559, 1-317-615-4559) Mon-Fri from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Eastern Time (UTC/GMT - 5 hrs, EST), or speak with your personal physician, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H8L6, Canada",
