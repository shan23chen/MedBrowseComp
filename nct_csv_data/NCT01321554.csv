NCT01321554,"A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Trial of Lenvatinib (E7080) in 131I-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01321554,SELECT,COMPLETED,"This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to compare the progression free survival, overall response rate (ORR) and safety of participants treated with lenvatinib 24 mg by continuous once daily oral dosing versus placebo. The study is conducted in 3 phases: a Prerandomization Phase (screening and baseline period), a Randomization Phase (double-blind treatment period), and an Extension Phase (Optional Open Label (OOL) Lenvatinib Treatment Period and a follow-up period).",YES,Thyroid Cancer,DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Lenvatinib,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first), as determined by blinded IIR using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for the double-blind treatment period (Randomization Phase). Disease progression per RECIST v1.1 was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) relative increase and 5 millimeter (mm) absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study), recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first), assessed up to data cutoff date (15 Nov 2013) or up to approximately 2.5 years","Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the percentage of participants who had best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by blinded IIR using RECIST 1.1 for target lesions and assessed by magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) scans (for double blind treatment period i.e. Randomization Phase). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR = CR + PR., Date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first), assessed up to data cutoff date (15 Nov 2013) or up to approximately 2.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival measured from the date of randomization until date of death from any cause. Overall survival is adjusted with rank preserving structural failure time., Date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to data cutoff date (15 Nov 2013) or up to
