NCT00805194,LUME-Lung 1: BIBF 1120 Plus Docetaxel as Compared to Placebo Plus Docetaxel in 2nd Line Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00805194,,COMPLETED,"The present trial will be performed to evaluate whether BIBF 1120 in combination with standard therapy of docetaxel in patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC is more effective as compared to placebo in combination with standard therapy of docetaxel. A secondary aim is to obtain safety information as well as information on quality of life of patients treated with BIBF 1120 in combination to standard therapy with docetaxel. In addition, blood will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis.",YES,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",DRUG: placebo plus docetaxel|DRUG: BIBF 1120 plus docetaxel,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Central Independent Review, Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by central independent review according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) . Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from date of randomisation to date of progression or death (whatever occurs earlier).

Median, 25th and 75th percentiles are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve., From randomisation until cut-off date 2 November 2010 (when 713 PFS events were observed)","Overall Survival (Key Secondary Endpoint), Overall Survival (OS) defined as the duration from randomisation to death (irrespective of the reason of death). Median, 25th and 75th percentiles are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve.

A fixed-sequence-testing was implemented for key secondary endpoint if both the primary and the follow-up analysis showed a treatment benefit (P\<0.05) of nintedanib over placebo. In this case, the OS would be tested using hierarchical testing of statistical hypotheses in (1) patients with adenocarcinoma and \<9 months since start of first-line therapy, (2) patients with adenocarcinoma, and (3) all patients. Each hypothesis could be only tested at the pre-specified alpha level if the previous null hypothesis in the testing sequence had been., From randomisation until cut-off date 15 February 2013 (approximately 48 months or 1151 deaths among all patients )|Follow-up Analysis of Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Central Independent Review, Follow-up analysis was conducted at the time of overall survival analysis. Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by central independent review according to the modified RECIST (version 1.0) criteria.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator according to the modified RECIST (version 1.0) criteria.

Median, 25th and 75th percentiles are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve., From randomisation until cut-off date 15 February 2013|Objective Tumour Response, Confirmed objective response is defined as confirmed Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) and evaluated according to the modified RECIST criteria version 1.0.

As per RECIST v1.0, Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.

This endpoint was analysed based on the central independent reviewer as well as the investigator., From randomisation until cut-off date 15 February 2013|Duration of Confirmed Objective Tumour Response, The duration of objective response is the time from first documented (CR) or (PR) to the time of progression or death and evaluated according to the modified RECIST criteria version 1.0.

As per RECIST v1.0, Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.

Median, 25th and 75th percentiles are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve.

This endpoint was analysed based on the central independent reviewer as well as the investigator., From randomisation until cut-off date 15 February 2013|Time to Confirmed Objective Tumour Response, Time to confirmed objective response is defined as time from randomisation to the date of first documented (CR) or (PR) and evaluated according to the modified RECIST criteria version 1.0.

Median, 25th and 75th percentiles are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve.

This endpoint was analysed based on the central independent reviewer as well as the investigator., From randomisation until cut-off date 15 February 2013|Disease Control, Disease control was defined as a best overall response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) and evaluated according to the modified RECIST criteria version 1.0.

As per RECIST v1.0 for target lesions : Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; progression, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression.

This endpoint was analysed based on the central independent reviewer as well as the investigator., From randomisation until cut-off date 15 February 2013|Duration of Disease Control, The duration of disease control was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of disease progression or death (which ever occurs first) for patients with disease control.
