NCT00533949,High-Dose or Standard-Dose Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00533949,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether high-dose radiation therapy is more effective than standard-dose radiation therapy when given together with combination chemotherapy with or without cetuximab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high-dose or standard-dose radiation therapy given together with chemotherapy with or without cetuximab to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.",YES,Lung Cancer|Radiation Toxicity,BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|RADIATION: 60 Gy RT|RADIATION: 74 Gy RT,"Overall Survival, Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.","Progression-free Survival, A failure for progression-free survival (PFS) is the first occurrence of local or regional progression, distant metastases, or death from any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a nontarget lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Time is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first failure. Patients without failure are censored at the date of last follow-up., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.|Local-regional Failure (Reported as Two-year Estimates), A failure for local-regional failure is the first occurrence of local or regional progression. Time is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first failure. Patients alive without local or regional failure at the time of last follow-up are censored. Patients who died without local or regional failure are considered as having competing risk at the time of death. Local-regional failure was estimated by the cumulative incidence method and 2 year estimates are reported., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.|Percentage of Participants With Grade 3-5 Esophagitis and Pneumonitis Adverse Events as Assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0, Treatment-related esophagitis and pneumonitis were assessed graded using the CTCAE v3.0. Comparisons are only made between radiation therapy dosing levels because the cetuximab regimen was known to be safe in combination with radiation therapy., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.|Percentage of Participants With Other Grade 3-5 Adverse Events as Assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0, Treatment-related adverse events other than esophagitis and pneumonitis were assessed graded using the CTCAE v3.0. Comparisons are only made between radiation therapy dosing levels because the cetuximab regimen was known to be safe in combination with radiation therapy., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.|Death During or Within 30 Days of Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment, Deaths regardless of cause and occuring during or within 30 days of discontinuation of protocol treatment were evaluated., From start of protocol treatment to 24 months.|Percentage of Patients With Decline From Baseline to 3 Months in the Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS) of the Functional Assessment of the Cancer Therapy Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI)., A decline of 2 points in the LCS from baseline to 3 months was considered a clinically meaningful change indicating a decline in quality of life. Comparisons are only made between radiation therapy dosing levels because the cetuximab regimen was known to be safe in combination with radiation therapy., At baseline and 3 months.|Patient-reported Swallowing Score (Area Under the Curve), Patients completed a swallowing diary prior to the start of treatment and then daily during treatment. Patients recorded a score to indicate problems with swallowing on that day (1-None, 2-Mild soreness only, 3-Can swallow solids with some difficulty, 4-Cannot swallow solids, 5-Cannot swallow liquids). These scores were then plotted across time and the area under the curve from baseline until the end of week 6 was calculated. A lower area under the curve indicates better swallowing ability. Comparisons are only made between radiation therapy dosing levels because the cetuximab regimen was known to be safe in combination with radiation therapy., From randomization to 6 weeks after start of radiation therapy (6-10 weeks from randomization)|EuroQoL (EQ5D) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Through One Year (Area Under the Curve), The visual analogue scale is a self-assessment of current health state, measured on a 20-cm scale ranging from 0 for the worst imaginable health state to 100 for best imaginable health state, marked at 10-point intervals. The area under the curve of each subject's EQ5D visual analog scale (VAS) response trajectory within 1 year was calculated. The EQ5D VAS utility was normalized by the baseline score. The trajectory included all available time points through one year. If a subject died within one year, the EQ5D VAS was reduced to 0 at the time of death. If subject was censored within one year, the EQ5D utility curve was truncated at the time of censoring. The scores were plotted across time and the area under the curve was calculated. A greater area under the curve indicates a better health state. Comparisons are only made between radiation therapy dosing levels because the cetuximab regimen was known to be safe in combination with radiation, From randomization to one year|Overall Survival and Local-regional Failure by Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Group, EGFR is a protein that is present on the surface of both normal cells and cancer cancer cells. EGFR H-Score is a measure of staining intensity ranging from 0 to 300 where a higher value indicates greater intensity of EGFR. Available tumor samples were evaluated for EGFR and given an H-Score. Patients were divided into two groups based on H-Score values dichotomized at 200. All event times are time from randomization to date of event or censoring. A survival event is death from any cause, patients without events are censored at the date of last contact, and survival rates are estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. A local-regional event is the first development of progressive disease locally or regionally, patients who do not have an event are censored at the date of death or last contact, and event rates are estimated by cumulative incidence. Two-year rates are reported., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.|Percentage of Patients With Grade 3+ Adverse Events by Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Group, EGFR is a protein that is present on the surface of both normal cells and cancer cancer cells. EGFR H-Score is a measure of staining intensity ranging from 0 to 300 where a higher value indicates greater intensity of EGFR. Available tumor samples were evaluated for EGFR and given an H-Score. Patients were divided into two groups based on H-Score values dichotomized at 200. Worst toxicity as determined by adverse events was used as a measure of a patient's quality of life (QOL). Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to AE. Highest grade (worst) adverse event (AE) per subject was counted., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.|Prognostic and Predictive Effects of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) on Overall Survival, Gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as the combined volume (cubic centimeters) of the primary tumor and clinically positive lymph nodes seen either on the planning computed tomography (CT) scan or the pretreatment positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact. GTV was evaluated as a continuous variable therefore overall survival time is not summarized by GTV. ""Prognostic"" refers to the main effect and ""predictive"" refers to the interaction between GTV and treatment arm., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 61.5 months.|Prognostic Value of Pre-treatment Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan in Predicting Survival, Distant Metastasis, and Local-regional Failure, Standardized uptake value (SUV) is a simple way of determining activity in PET imaging. It is a mathematically derived ratio of tissue radioactivity concentration at a point in time and the injected dose of radioactivity per kilogram of the patient's body weight. All event times are time from randomization to date of event or censoring. A survival event is death from any cause, patients without events are censored at the date of last contact, and survival rates are estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Local-regional and distant metastasis events are the first development of progressive disease locally/regionally or distant metastasis, respectively, patients who do not have an event are censored at the date of death or last contact, and event rates are estimated by cumulative incidence. Two-year rates are presented. PET SUV was evaluated as a continuous variable therefore the outcome variables are not summarized by PET SUV., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occured after all patients were on study for 18 months.
