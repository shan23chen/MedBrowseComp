NCT00309985,Androgen Ablation Therapy With or Without Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00309985,CHAARTED,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen ablation therapy may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether androgen-ablation therapy is more effective with or without docetaxel in treating metastatic prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying androgen-ablation therapy and chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to androgen-ablation therapy alone in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.",YES,Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer,DRUG: androgen-deprivation therapy|DRUG: docetaxel,"Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death or date last known alive. Survival data reflects the database as of December 23, 2013., Assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2 - 5 years from study entry; then annually if patient is 5 - 10 years from study entry","Time to Clinical Progression, Time to clinical progression is defined as the time from randomization to clinical progression. Clinical progression is defined as increasing symptomatic bone metastases, progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria or clinical deterioration due to cancer per investigator's opinion. Patients without documented clinical progression were censored at the date of last disease assessment. Secondary endpoint data reflect the database as of December 23, 2014., Assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2 - 5 years from study entry; then annually if patient is 5 - 10 years from study entry|Time to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (Hormone Refractory Disease), Time to castration resistant prostate cancer is defined as the time from randomization to PSA progression or clinical progression, whichever occurred first. Patients without documented progression were censored at the date of last disease assessment. Secondary endpoint data reflect the database as of December 23, 2014., Assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2 - 5 years from study entry; then annually if patient is 5 - 10 years from study entry|Proportion of Patients With PSA Complete Response (CR) at 6 Months, PSA CR is defined as a PSA level less than 0.2 ng/ml measured for 2 consecutive measurements at least 4 weeks apart. Patients who met the criterion of PSA CR and had PSA level less than 0.2 ng/ml before and after the 6-month time point are considered as having a PSA CR at 6 months., Assessed at 6 months|Proportion of Patients With PSA Complete Response (CR) at 12 Months, PSA CR is defined as a PSA level less than 0.2 ng/ml measured for 2 consecutive measurements at least 4 weeks apart. Patients who met the criterion of PSA CR and had PSA level less than 0.2 ng/ml before and after the 12-month time point are considered as having a PSA CR at 12 months., Assessed at 12 months|QOL Change From Baseline to 3 Months, The primary QOL change was evaluated by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) instrument. FACT-P is a self-report measure of both general and disease-specific QOL. Higher scores represent better QOL. The FACT-P (version 4) contains 39 likert items distributed over 5 subscales: physical (7 items), social/family (7 items), emotional (6 items), and functional (7 items) well-being, and the additional concerns related to prostate cancer scale (12 items). The FACT-P total score is calculated by summing all these 5 subscales and ranges from 0 to 156., Assessed at baseline and 3 months",,ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI),MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,790,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,E3805|E3805|U10CA180794,2006-09-26,2013-12-23,2025-06,2006-04-03,2016-03-03,2025-04-01,"Providence Cancer Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Fairbanks Cancer Treatment Center at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, Fairbanks, Alaska, 99701, United States|Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona, 85054, United States|Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259-5499, United States|Hembree Mercy Cancer Center at St. Edward Mercy Medical Center, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 72903, United States|Arkansas Cancer Research Center at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Alta Bates Summit Comprehensive Cancer Center, Berkeley, California, 94704, United States|Peninsula Medical Center, Burlingame, California, 94010, United States|California Cancer Care, Incorporated - Greenbrae, Greenbrae, California, 94904, United States|USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital, Los Angeles, California, 90089-9181, United States|Tibotec Therapeutics - Division of Ortho Biotech Products, LP, Marysville, California, 95901, United States|Mather Veteran Affairs Medical Center, Mather, California, 95655, United States|Mercy Cancer Center at Mercy Medical Center, Merced, California, 95340, United States|Memorial Medical Center, Modesto, California, 95355, United States|Sutter Health - Western Division Cancer Research Group, Novato, California, 94945, United States|University of California Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Saint Helena Hospital, Saint Helena, California, 94574, United States|California Pacific Medical Center - California Campus, San Francisco, California, 94118, United States|Sutter Pacific Medical Foundation, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|Tahoe Forest Cancer Center, Truckee, California, 96161, United States|Sutter Solano Medical Center, Vallejo, California, 94589, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center at UC Health Sciences Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Denver, Denver, Colorado, 80220, United States|Shaw Regional Cancer Center, Edwards, Colorado, 81632, United States|Poudre Valley Hospital, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80524, United States|Front Range Cancer Specialists, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80528, United States|St. Mary's Regional Cancer Center at St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center, Grand Junction, Colorado, 81502, United States|Montrose Memorial Hospital Cancer Center, Montrose, Colorado, 81401, United States|Saint Francis/Mount Sinai Regional Cancer Center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut, 06105, United States|Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520-8028, United States|Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20007, United States|George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20037, United States|Michael and Dianne Bienes Comprehensive Cancer Center at Holy Cross Hospital, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33308, United States|University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0232, United States|Mayo Clinic - Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|Ella Milbank Foshay Cancer Center at Jupiter Medical Center, Jupiter, Florida, 33458, United States|CCOP - Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, 33140, United States|Northeast Georgia Medical Center, Gainesville, Georgia, 30501, United States|Mountain States Tumor Institute at St. Luke's Regional Medical Center, Boise, Idaho, 83712, United States|Saint Luke's Mountain States Tumor Institute - Fruitland, Fruitland, Idaho, 83619, United States|Idaho Urologic Institute, PA, Meridian, Idaho, 83642, United States|Mountain States Tumor Institute - Meridian, Meridian, Idaho, 83642, United States|Saint Luke's Mountain States Tumor Institute, Nampa, Idaho, 83686, United States|Mountain States Tumor Institute at St. Luke's, Twin Falls, Idaho, 83301, United States|Rush-Copley Cancer Care Center, Aurora, Illinois, 60504, United States|Illinois CancerCare - Bloomington, Bloomington, Illinois, 61701, United States|Graham Hospital, Canton, Illinois, 61520, United States|Illinois CancerCare - Canton, Canton, Illinois, 61520, United States|Illinois CancerCare - Carthage, Carthage, Illinois, 62321, United States|Memorial Hospital, Carthage, Illinois, 62321, United States|Robert H.
