NCT00075478,Total-Body Irradiation With or Without Fludarabine Phosphate Followed By Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00075478,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial is studying total-body irradiation (TBI) and fludarabine phosphate to see how it works compared with TBI alone followed by donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with hematologic cancer. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and radiation therapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening. It is not yet known whether TBI followed by donor stem cell transplant is more effective with or without fludarabine phosphate in treating hematologic cancer.",YES,"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Remission|Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission|Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, BCR-ABL1 Positive|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm|Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm|Plasma Cell Myeloma|Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma|Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia",PROCEDURE: Total-Body Irradiation|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|DRUG: Mycophenolate Mofetil|DRUG: Cyclosporine|PROCEDURE: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation,"Overall Survival, Percentage of patients surviving as estimated by Kaplan-Meier., 3 years after transplant","Incidence of Non-relapse Mortality, Percentage of NRM as estimated by cumulative incidence methods with competing risks, 3 years after transplant|Incidence of Relapse/Progression, Percentage of relapse estimated by cumulative incidence methods, 3 years after transplant|Incidence of Relapse-related Mortality, Percentage of death following relapse/progression, estimated by cumulative incidence methods, 3 years after transplant|Incidence of Grades II-IV Acute GVHD, Percentage patients with grades II-IV GHVD, estimated by cumulative incidence methods, 120 days after transplant|Incidence of Chronic Extensive GVHD, Percentage patients with chronic extensive GVHD, estimated by cumulative incidence methods, 3 years after transplant|Incidence of Graft Rejection, Donor CD3 chimerism less than 5%, 1 year after transplant|Progression-free Survival, Percentage of patients with progression-free survival, estimated by cumulative incidence methods, 3 years after transplant",,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)|National Cancer Institute (NCI)",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,87,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,1813.00|NCI-2009-01532|1813.00|P30CA015704|P01CA078902,2003-10,2014-02,2014-02-02,2004-01-12,2014-05-19,2017-05-15,"OHSU Cancer Institute-Southern Region, Medford, Oregon, 97504, United States|Huntsman Cancer Institute/University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84112, United States|LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84143, United States|VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, Washington, 98101, United States|Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/University of Washington Cancer Consortium, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States|Medizinische Univ Klinik Koln, Koln, 50924, Germany|Universitaet Leipzig, Leipzig, D-04103, Germany|University of Tuebingen-Germany, Tuebingen, D-72076, Germany|University of Torino, Torino, 10126, Italy",
