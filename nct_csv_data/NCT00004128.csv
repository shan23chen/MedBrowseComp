NCT00004128,"Combination Chemotherapy, Interleukin-2, and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00004128,,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Giving combination chemotherapy before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood or bone marrow and stored. More chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Interleukin-2 may stimulate the patient's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different regimens of combination chemotherapy, interleukin-2, and peripheral stem cell transplant and comparing them to see how well they work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",NO,Leukemia,BIOLOGICAL: aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: busulfan|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: daunorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: etoposide|PROCEDURE: autologous bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation|RADIATION: radiation therapy,Duration of overall survival and disease-free survival after first randomization|Duration of overall survival and disease-free survival after second randomization,Response after induction and consolidation|Toxicity measured by Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) CTCAE v3.0 after induction and consolidation|Disease-free survival after complete remission (CR)|Disease-free interval from CR|Time to death in CR|Peripheral stem cell harvest after consolidation|Rate of completion of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT),,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell'Adulto,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE3,2000,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000067356|EORTC-06991|GIMEMA-EORTC-06991,1999-09,2008-01,,2003-01-27,,2009-12-23,,
