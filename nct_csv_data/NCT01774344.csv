NCT01774344,Study of Regorafenib After Sorafenib in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01774344,RESORCE,COMPLETED,The objective of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with advanced liver cancer who had progressed after sorafenib treatment. Patients were treated with regorafenib or placebo using a 2:1 randomization scheme.,YES,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","DRUG: Regorafenib (Stivarga, BAY73-4506)|DRUG: Placebo","Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization (Day 1) to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From randomization (Day 1) of the first subject until 419 days later","Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was the time (days) from randomization to radiological or clinical disease progression assessed by independent radiological review. Median and 95% confidence interval were reported for the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) analysis sets. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From date of randomization until 30 days after last study treatment (assessed every 6 weeks until PD; and after 8 cycle assessed every 12 weeks) (approximately 33 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time (days) from date of randomization to date of disease progression (radiological or clinical) or death due to any cause, if death occurs before progression was documented. Death in the absence of progression was a PFS event only if it occurred within the 12+1 weeks for subjects who discontinued treatment prior to cycle 8 and 24+2 weeks for subjects who discontinued treatment after to cycle 8 of the last evaluable tumor assessment; PFS were censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment, if it occurred later. Median and 95% confidence interval 95% were reported for the mRECIST and RECIST 1.1 analysis sets. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From date of randomization until 30 days after last study treatment (assessed every 6 weeks until PD; and after 8 cycle assessed every 12 weeks)|Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR), Objective tumor response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of subjects whose best tumor response CR or Partial Response (PR) observed during trial period assessed according to the mRECIST criteria and RECIST 1.1. CR= Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target). Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. Subjects prematurely discontinuing without an assessment were to be considered non-responders for the analysis., From date of randomization until 30 days after last study treatment (assessed every 6 weeks until PD; and after 8 cycle assessed every 12 weeks) (approximately 33 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was CR (CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target).), PR (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.), or stable disease (SD) (SD: steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.) according to RECIST and RECIST 1.1 criteria. SD had to be maintained for at least 6 weeks from the first demonstration of that rating., From date of randomization until 30 days after last study treatment (assessed every 6 weeks until PD; and after 8 cycle assessed every 12 weeks) (approximately 33 months)","Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization (Day 1) to death due to any cause, From randomization (Day 1) of the first subject to end of follow upto 1710 days",Bayer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,573,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",15982|2012-003649-14,2013-05-14,2016-02-29,2019-07-05,2013-01-24,2017-06-05,2020-08-20,"Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Orange, California, 92868-3201, United States|Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Washington, District of Columbia, 20007-2197, United States|Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0286, United States|Tampa, Florida, 33606, United States|Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|Louisville, Kentucky, 40202, United States|Worcester, Massachusetts, 01655, United States|Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|New York, New York, 10029, United States|Rochester, New York, 14642, United States|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15232, United States|Richmond, Virginia, 23249, United States|Seattle, Washington, 98101, United States|Pilar, Buenos Aires, B1629ODT, Argentina|Camperdown, New South Wales, 2050, Australia|Liverpool, New South Wales, 2170, Australia|Herston, Queensland, 4029, Australia|Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia|Box Hill, 3128, Australia|Linz, Oberösterreich, 4020, Austria|Graz, Steiermark, 8036, Austria|Wien, 1090, Austria|Bruxelles -
