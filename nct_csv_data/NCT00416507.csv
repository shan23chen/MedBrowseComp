NCT00416507,Gemcitabine With or Without Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00416507,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, fluorouracil, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine, fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiation therapy to see how well they work compared to gemcitabine alone in treating patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.",NO,Pancreatic Cancer,DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: liposomal cisplatin,,,,Federation Francophone de Cancerologie Digestive,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,190,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000453847|FFCD-2000-01|EU-20542|FFCD-SFRO-2000-01,2000-03,2005-07,2007-01,2006-12-28,,2016-05-30,,
