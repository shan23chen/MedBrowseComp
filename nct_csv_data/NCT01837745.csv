NCT01837745,Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: is There a Need for Radioiodine Ablation in Low Risk Patients?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01837745,ESTIMABL2,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Open-label randomized phase III trial, using a non-inferiority comparison design. After randomization,patients will receive either post-operative radioiodine ablation with an activity of 1.1 GBq (30 mCi) after stimulation by rhTSH, and then be followed-up (ablation group) or be followed-up (without postoperative radioiodine ablation) (follow-up group).

The objective is to assess the non-inferiority of the proportion of patients without tumor-related event evaluated at three years after randomisation in the absence of radioiodine ablation (follow-up group) compared to the ablation group, in patients with low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy with or without lymph node dissection (pT1am N0 or Nx, pT1b N0 or Nx)",NO,Low Risk Differentiated Thyroid Cancer,DRUG: rhTSH stimulation|DRUG: I131|OTHER: Follow up,"Rate of patient without event at 3 years following randomization, assessed up to 3 years","Lachrymal and Salivary Glands Toxicities, Assessed up at baseline, 2 months, 10 months and 3 years after randomization|Patient's quality of life, anxiety and fear of recurrence, at inclusion, 2 months after inclusion, 10 months and 3 years after randomization|Rate of patients without event, at 5 years following randomization|Rate of events adjusted on the initial lymph node status, at 3 and 5 years following randomization|Recurrence rate (histologically proven), at 3 years following randomization and then at 5 years|Rate of cure after an event, at 5 years after randomization|Cost of treatment and follow-up, at 3 years after randomization|Rate of events adjusted on tumoral molecular characterization, 3 and 5 years after randomization",,"Gustave Roussy, Cancer Campus, Grand Paris",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,776,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,2012-A01569-34|2012/1913,2013-05-13,2022-04-01,2030-01-01,2013-04-23,,2023-05-17,"Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, Val De Marne, 94805, France",
