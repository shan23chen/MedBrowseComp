NCT04223856,Enfortumab Vedotin and Pembrolizumab vs. Chemotherapy Alone in Untreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04223856,EV-302,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,This study is being done to see how well two drugs (enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab) work together to treat patients with urothelial cancer. The study will compare these drugs to other drugs that are usually used to treat this cancer (standard of care). The patients in this study will have cancer that has spread from their urinary system to other parts of their body.,YES,Urothelial Cancer,DRUG: Enfortumab vedotin|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v) 1.1 by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to first documentation of disease progression (PD), or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.
