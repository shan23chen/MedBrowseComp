NCT00020566,"Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation, Radiation Therapy, and/or Surgery in Treating Patients With Ewing's Sarcoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00020566,,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without radiation therapy and/or surgery in treating Ewing's sarcoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens to see how well they work when given with or without peripheral stem cell transplantation, radiation therapy, and/or surgery in treating patients with Ewing's sarcoma.",NO,Sarcoma,BIOLOGICAL: dactinomycin|DRUG: busulfan|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: ifosfamide|DRUG: melphalan|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|PROCEDURE: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy,Event-free survival|Overall survival,"Feasibility, toxicity, and response at 1 month following induction therapy|Feasibility and toxicity of consolidation regimens at 1 month following consolidation therapy",,University of Leicester,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group|Societe Francaise Oncologie Pediatrique|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer -
