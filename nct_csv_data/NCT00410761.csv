NCT00410761,An Efficacy Study Comparing ZD6474 to Placebo in Medullary Thyroid Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00410761,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to learn how hereditary or sporadic medullary thyroid cancer patients, treated with ZD6474, react to the drug, what happens to ZD6474 in the human body, about the side effects of ZD6474, and if ZD6474 can decrease or prevent the growth of tumors.",YES,Thyroid Cancer,DRUG: ZD6474 (Vandetanib),"Progression-Free Survival(PFS), Median time to progression (months) from randomisation until objective disease progression (determined by RECIST assessments) or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment. Values here are estimated (from a Weibull model) as the medians were not met., RECIST tumour assessments were performed at screening (within 3 weeks before date of randomisation), then once every 12 weeks up to and including discontinuation of blinded study treatment, unless patients had withdrawn consent.","Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is the number of patients that are responders ie those patients with a confirmed best objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by RECIST criteria.

The categories for best objective response are CR, PR, stable disease (SD)\>= 12 weeks, progressive disease (PD) or NE., RECIST assessments performed at screening (within 3 weeks before randomisation), then every 12 weeks. For patients with objective response of CR or PR, an additional confirmatory scan was performed ≥4 weeks following the date of first response.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients who achieved disease control at 8 weeks following randomisation. Disease control at 8 weeks is defined as a best objective response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) \>= 12 weeks, RECIST tumour assessments were performed at screening (within 3 weeks before date of randomisation), then once every 12 weeks up to and including discontinuation of blinded study treatment, unless patients had withdrawn consent|Duration of Response (DoR), Response is defined as a confirmed best objective response of CR or PR. Duration of response is defined as time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (provided death is within 3 months of last RECIST assessment). Values are estimated as the medians weren't met, RECIST tumour assessments were performed at screening (within 3 weeks before date of randomisation), then once every 12 weeks up to and including discontinuation of blinded study treatment, unless patients had withdrawn consent|Overall Survival (OS), As data was immature at data cut off, number of death events is quoted, Number of deaths since randomisation|Biochemical Response Calcitonin (CTN), Best biochemical response was calculated from assessments at baseline and during treatment. Responders were those patients with a best biochemical response of CR or PR, confirmed by repeat assessments, which were to be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for PR or CR were first met. CR and PR being defined according to level of CTN., Blood samples Blood samples for analysis of CTN were taken at screening baseline (average of 0, 1, 4 and 8 hours), then every 4 weeks until discontinuation and 60 day follow up|Biochemical Response Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), Best biochemical response was calculated from assessments at baseline and during treatment. Responders were those patients with a best biochemical response of CR or PR, confirmed by repeat assessments, which were to be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for PR or CR were first met. CR and PR being defined according to level of CEA., Blood samples for analysis of CEA were taken at screening baseline (average of 0, 1, 4 and 8 hours), then every 4 weeks until discontinuation and 60 day follow up|Time to Worsening of Pain (TWP), TWP was derived using the worst pain score from brief pain inventory (BPI) and patient reported opioid analgesic use. BPI uses 0 to 10 numeric rating scales asking subjects to rate their pain., During the last week of the screening period (Day -7 to Day 0), the brief pain inventory (BPI) and opioid analgesic use were self-reported once a day for 4 days to establish baseline, then every week during blinded study treatment, up to discontinuation.",,"Genzyme, a Sanofi Company",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,437,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",D4200C00058|LPS14811|2005-005077-29,2006-11-30,2009-07-31,2024-07-26,2006-12-13,2012-03-26,2025-03-25,"Investigational Site Number 3, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|University Arkansas Site Number : 3, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Investigational Site Number 8, San Francisco, California, 94115, United States|USCF / Mt Zion Medical Center Site Number : 8, San Francisco, California, 94115, United States|Investigational Site Number 9, Aurora, Colorado, 80010, United States|University Of Colorado Health Sciences Center Site Number : 9, Aurora, Colorado, 80010, United States|Investigational Site Number 11, New Haven, Connecticut, 06510, United States|Yale University School Medicine Site Number : 11, New Haven, Connecticut, 06510, United States|Investigational Site Number 15, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|Mayo Clinic- Site Number : 15, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|Investigational Site Number 18, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|The University Of Chicago Site Number : 18, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|Investigational Site Number 17, Lexington, Kentucky, 40536-0298, United States|The University Of Kentucky Site Number : 17, Lexington, Kentucky, 40536-0298, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute Site Number : 2, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Investigational Site Number 2, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Investigational Site Number 7, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Wayne State University / Harper Hospital Site Number : 7, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Investigational Site Number 14, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Mayo Clinic- Site Number : 14, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Investigational Site Number 10, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Washington University School Of Med Site Number : 10, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Investigational Site Number 6, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267-0589, United States|University Of Cincinnati Site Number : 6, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267-0589, United States|Investigational Site Number 22, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Oregon Health & Science University- Site Number : 22, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Investigational Site Number 19, Charleston, South Carolina, 29425, United States|Medical University of South Carolina- Site Number : 19, Charleston, South Carolina, 29425, United States|Anderson Cancer Center Site Number : 13, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Investigational Site Number 13, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Fletcher Allen Health Care Site Number : 21, Burlington, Vermont, 05401, United States|Investigational Site Number 21, Burlington, Vermont, 05401, United States|Investigational Site Number 1001, St Leonards, 2065, Australia|Investigational Site Number 1901, Wien, 1901, Austria|Investigational Site Number : 1901, Wien, 1901, Austria|Investigational Site Number : 1101, Anderlecht, 1070, Belgium|Investigational Site Number 1101, Bruxelles, 1000, Belgium|Investigational Site Number 1102, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Investigational Site Number : 1102, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Hospital De Clinicas De Porto Alegre- Site Number : 2301, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande Do Sul, 90035-003, Brazil|Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto -
