The time to invPFS is calculated in months as the time from randomization to disease progression +1 day, as determined by RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.1, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Assessments every 8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) until disease progression, death, or initiation of subsequent treatment. After 18 months on study, assessments every 16 weeks.

ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) by RECIST v1.1. The confirmed response is defined as a CR or PR on subsequent tumor assessment at least 28 days after first response documentation. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter., Assessments every 8 weeks from C1D1 until disease progression, death, or initiation of subsequent treatment.

Total follow-up was up to approximately 3.5 years.|Investigator Assessed Duration of Response (DOR) by RECIST v1.1 (Efficacy Population), A secondary endpoint is the DOR for the Treatment Part of the study. The DOR as assessed by investigator is analyzed in the subgroup of patients who had a confirmed response by RECIST v1.1. DOR for any confirmed RECIST CR or PR will be measured from the date of the first response until the first date that progressive disease (PD) is documented. DOR is calculated in months as the time from the first date of the scan showing a response to the first scan with disease progression +1 day. Any patients with an ongoing response are censored at the date of the last post-baseline scan. Only tumor scans up to and within 6 weeks of start of any subsequent anti-cancer treatment are included. Progressive disease (PD) is defined using RECIST v1.1, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Assessments every 8 weeks from C1D1 until disease progression, death, or initiation of subsequent treatment.

Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. Response to CA-125 has occurred if there is at least a 50% decrease from baseline: 1. in a sample collected after initiation of study treatment AND 2. that is confirmed in a subsequent sample collected ≥21 days after the prior sample. The absolute value of this confirmatory sample must be ≤110% of the prior sample. The date when the first sample with a 50% decrease from baseline is observed is the date of the CA-125 response., Assessments every 8 weeks from C1D1 until disease progression, death, or initiation of subsequent treatment.

The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Global scores are converted to a score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating improved health status. Mean changes from baseline global score over the first 6 cycles in the Treatment Part of the study were analyzed., Baseline to the end of Cycle 6, or up to approximately 6 months|Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status Score for the First 6 Cycles (ITT Population), EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer patients.
