NCT04194944,A Study of Selpercatinib (LY3527723) in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic RET Fusion-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04194944,LIBRETTO-431,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,The reason for this study is to see if the study drug selpercatinib compared to a standard treatment is effective and safe in participants with rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body. Participants who are assigned to the standard treatment and discontinue due to progressive disease have the option to potentially crossover to selpercatinib.,YES,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Selpercatinib|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Pembrolizumab,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) (With Pembrolizumab), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the occurrence of documented disease progression by the BICR, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria, or death from any cause in the absence of BICR-documented progressive disease., Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death from Any Cause Up to 31 Months|PFS by BICR (With or Without Pembrolizumab), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the occurrence of documented disease progression by the BICR, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria, or death from any cause in the absence of BICR-documented progressive disease., Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death from Any Cause Up to 31 Months","Percentage of Participant With Disease Control Rate (DCR) by BICR (With Pembrolizumab), DCR by BICR (with Pembrolizumab) is defined as the number of participants who achieve a BOR of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) lasting 16 or more weeks divided by the total number of participants randomized to each treatment arm., Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death from Any Cause Up to 31 Months|Percentage of Participant With DCR by BICR (With or Without Pembrolizumab), DCR by BICR (with or without Pembrolizumab) is defined as the number of participants who achieve a BOR of CR, PR, or SD lasting 16 or more weeks divided by the total number of participants randomized to each treatment arm., Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death from Any Cause Up to 31 Months|PFS2 (With Pembrolizumab), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression on the next line of treatment or death from any cause in the absence of observed disease progression., Baseline to Second Disease Progression or Death from Any Cause Up to 38 Months|PFS2 (With or Without Pembrolizumab), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression on the next line of treatment or death from any cause in the absence of observed disease progression., Baseline to Second Disease Progression or Death from Any Cause Up to 38 Months|Overall Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by BICR (With Pembrolizumab), ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of participants randomized to each treatment arm., Baseline through Disease Progression or Death Up to 31 Months|ORR: Percentage of Participants With CR or PR by BICR (With or Without Pembrolizumab), ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of participants randomized to each treatment arm., Baseline through Disease Progression or Death Up to 31 Months|Duration of Response (DoR) by BICR (With Pembrolizumab), DoR was defined as the time from the date that measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) were first met until the first date that disease was recurrent or documented disease progression was observed, or the date of death from any cause in the absence of documented disease progression or recurrence.
