The hypothesis to be tested in this study is the percentage of patients with steady state Cycle 5 Ctrough (Cycle 6 pre-dose) \>20 µg/mL of trastuzumab-Pfizer is similar to EU-approved trastuzumab, using a margin of -12.5%.",YES,Early Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: PF-05280014|DRUG: Taxotere®|DRUG: Paraplatin®|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab-EU|DRUG: Taxotere®|DRUG: Paraplatin®,"Percentage of Participants With Steady State Drug Concentration Ctrough (Cycle 6 Pre-dose) >20 µg/mL at Cycle 5., The percentage of participants with Cycle 5 Ctrough (Cycle 6 pre-dose) \>20 μg/mL in each treatment group, the denominator being the number of participants in the per protocol population for each treatment group., Cycle 5","Mean Predose Trastuzumab-Pfizer and Trastuzumab-EU Concentrations at Cycles 1 Through 6., Samples of blood were taken pre-dose on Cycles 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, and at 1 hour post dose on Cycles 1 and 5 for pharmacokinetic evaluation., Cycles 1 through 6|Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Defined as the Absence of Invasive Neoplastic Cells in the Breast and Lymph Nodes., Following surgery after treatment completion, tumors were assessed as Complete Pathological Response, Partial Pathological Response, or No Pathological Response., Cycle 6/End of treatment|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Defined as the Percentage of Participants Having Complete or Partial Response at End of Treatment, Based on Radiographic Assessments of the Tumor., ORR was defined as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable (SD), Progressive Disease (PD) or Indeterminate (IND).
