NCT00140582,Primary Rituximab and Maintenance,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00140582,,COMPLETED,"* Objectives

  * Primary objective: To evaluate in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma the benefit of maintenance therapy with rituximab after induction of response with chemotherapy plus rituximab in comparison with no maintenance therapy
  * Secondary objective: To evaluate response rates, event driven survival endpoints (EFS, PFS, OS) and quality of life of four different chemotherapy regimens combined with rituximab, with or without maintenance with rituximab, for first line treatment of advanced stage follicular lymphoma.
* Study Design This is an international open-label, multicentre, randomized study with two treatment phases. In the induction phase patients have to respond to 1st line induction treatment in order to be eligible for randomization to the second phase of maintenance treatment or observation. After the maintenance period patients will be included in the follow up phase for 3 years.",NO,Follicular Lymphoma,DRUG: Rituximab,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to progression, relapse, death from any cause., number of event observed driven : 344 events or 10 years","Response rates, event driven survival endpoints (EFS, PFS, OS), number of event observed driven : 344 events or 10 years|Quality of life, number of event observed driven : 344 events or 10 years",,Lymphoma Study Association,"HOVON - Dutch Haemato-Oncology Association|German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group|Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group|Institute of Cancer Research, United Kingdom",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1217,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,PRIMA,2004-12,2007-05,2016-12,2005-09-01,,2017-03-13,"Fundaleu Hospital, Buenos Aires, CP C1114AAN, Argentina|Australian Leukemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Australia|Université de Gent, Gent, Belgium|Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'adulte, Mont-Godinne, Belgium|Hospital Samaritano, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Fundación Santafé de Bogotá, Bogota, Colombia|Amtssygehuset i Herlev, Herlev, Denmark|Polyclinique Bordeaux Nord, Bordeaux, 33300, France|Hôpital Henri Mondor, Créteil, 94010, France|Hématologie CHU de Lille, Lille, 59000, France|Centre Léon Bérard, Lyon, 69008, France|Institut Curie, Paris, 75005, France|Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris, 75010, France|Hématologie Adultes - Hôpital Necker, Paris, 75743, France|Service d'Hématologie - Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-Bénite cedex, 69495, France|Centre Hospitalier Robert Debré, Reims, 51092, France|Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, 76038, France|Hématologie CHU Purpan, Toulouse, 31059, France|Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France|HOVON, Utrecht, Netherlands|Australia New Zealand Leukemia Lymphoma Group, Auckland, New Zealand|Instituo Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas, Lima, Peru|Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain|King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand",
