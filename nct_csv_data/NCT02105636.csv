NCT02105636,Trial of Nivolumab vs Therapy of Investigator's Choice in Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Carcinoma (CheckMate 141),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02105636,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to find out whether Nivolumab will significantly improve overall survival as compared to therapy of investigator's choice in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck carcinoma.,YES,Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck,DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Docetaxel,"Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. Participants were censored at the date they were last known to be alive and at the date of randomization if they were randomized but had no follow-up. Median OS time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method., From date of randomization to date of death (Up to approximately 18 months)","Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the investigator (as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1)), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progressive Disease: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. The sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. Participants who:

* Die without a reported progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death.
* Did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment.
* Without any on study tumor assessments and did not die were censored on their date of randomization.
* Received subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy prior to documented progression were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the initiation of the new therapy., From date of randomization to date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (Up to approximately 87 months)|Investigator-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of randomized participants who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST1.1 criteria as per investigator assessment. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From date of randomization to date of disease progression or study drug is discontinued, whichever occurs first (Up to approximately 87 months)",,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Ono Pharmaceutical Co.
