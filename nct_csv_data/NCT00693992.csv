NCT00693992,Sunitinib Malate as Maintenance Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Combination Chemotherapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00693992,,COMPLETED,This randomized phase III trial studies sunitinib malate to see how well it works when given as maintenance therapy (meaning it is approved for treatment after chemotherapy) in patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer who have responded to prior treatment with combination chemotherapy. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. It is not yet known whether sunitinib malate is effective in helping tumors continue to shrink or stop growing.,YES,Stage IIIB Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer AJCC v7,OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Placebo|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|DRUG: Sunitinib Malate,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. The median PFS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression is defined as in the primary outcome measure., Time from randomization to disease progression and death of any cause, whichever comes first (up to 5 years)","Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from patient randomization to death from any cause. The median OS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Time from randomization to death (up to 5 years)|Response Rate (RR), The percentage of patients who respond (completely or partially) to each combination regimen will be estimated. Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria:

Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Duration of treatment (up to 5 years)|Percentage of Deterioration in QOL at 3 Months Using the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Subscale, The percentage of patients with at least a 10% drop in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 Global Health Subscale score from baseline to 3-months. The difference between groups will be tested using Fisher's exact test., At 3 months|Percentage of Deterioration in Symptom Progression at 3 Months Using the EORTC LC13 Dyspnea Subscale, The percentage of patients with at least a 10% drop in the EORTC LC13 Dyspnea Subscale score from baseline to 3-months.
