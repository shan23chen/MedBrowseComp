NCT01989676,A Study Of PF-05280014 [Trastuzumab-Pfizer] Or Herceptin® [Trastuzumab-EU] Plus Paclitaxel In HER2 Positive First Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment (REFLECTIONS B327-02),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01989676,,COMPLETED,"The current study will compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab sourced from the European Union (trastuzumab-EU) with paclitaxel in female patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer in the first-line treatment setting. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the efficacy (ORR) of PF-05280014 is similar to trastuzumab-EU.",YES,Metastatic Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: PF-05280014|DRUG: Paclitaxel|BIOLOGICAL: Herceptin®|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Objective Response Rate (ORR) Derived From Central Radiology Assessments: ITT Population, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR, complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease; all target nodes must have decreased to normal size \[short axis \<10 mm\]) or partial response (PR, \>=30% decrease from baseline of the sum of diameters (SOD) of all target measurable lesions; the short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions) by Week 25 of the study and confirmed on a follow-up assessment (Week 33+/-14 days), based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1., From the date of randomization until all participants had either completed the Week 33 tumor assessment or discontinued study drug earlier than the Week 33 visit","One-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate Derived From Central Radiology Assessments: ITT Population, One-year PFS rate was analyzed based on the time from date of randomization to first documentation of progressive disease (PD), or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1. PD was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy) with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. The 95% CI for the median time to event was based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method., From the date of randomization until 378 days post-randomization|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Central Radiology Assessments: ITT Population, DOR:time from first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) to first documentation of PD/death due to any cause in absence of documented PD, based on central radiology review. As per RECIST v1.1, CR:complete disappearance of all target lesions with exception of nodal disease; all target nodes reduced in short axis \<10 mm. PR: \>=30% decrease from baseline of SOD of target lesions; short diameter used in sum for target nodes,longest diameter used in sum for other target lesions. PD for target disease:at least 20% increase in SOD of target lesions above smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in sum observed) with minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. For non-target disease:unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. The 95% CI for median time to event was based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method., From the date of randomization until 378 days post-randomization|Overall Survival: ITT Population, Overall survival was analyzed based on the time from date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored on the date of last contact. The 95% CI for the median time to event was based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley Method., From the date of randomization until end of study (approximately 6 years)|Serum Peak Concentration of PF-05280014 at Selected Cycles: Pharmacokinetics (PK) Population, Human PK serum samples were analyzed for concentrations of PF-05280014 using a validated, sensitive, and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., 1 hour post end of infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 5|Serum Peak Concentration of Trastuzumab-EU at Selected Cycles: PK Population, Human PK serum samples were analyzed for concentrations of trastuzumab-EU using a validated, sensitive, and specific ELISA., 1 hour post end of infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 5|Serum Trough (Pre-dose) Concentration of PF-05280014 at Selected Cycles: PK Population, Human PK serum samples were analyzed for concentrations of PF-05280014 using a validated, sensitive, and specific ELISA., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17 and Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 5|Serum Trough (Pre-dose) Concentration of Trastuzumab-EU at Selected Cycles: PK Population, Human PK serum samples were analyzed for concentrations of trastuzumab-EU using a validated, sensitive, and specific ELISA., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17 and Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 5|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) Sample: Safety Population, Two sensitive, specific, and semi-quantitative electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassays, 1 for detecting antibodies against PF-05280014 and the other for detecting antibodies against trastuzumab, were used to analyze ADA samples. Serum samples were first screened for ADA. Any samples that were positive in the screening assay were further analyzed to confirm the positive result and determine the antibody titers. All samples were taken prior to dosing.
