NCT00046527,Study of ABI-007 and Taxol in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00046527,,COMPLETED,"Paclitaxel (Taxol, Bristol-Meyers Squibb) has been shown to be very effective against metastatic breast cancer, as well as other cancers. Because the Taxol formulation of paclitaxel is dissolved in Cremophor, an organic solvent containing castor oil, and ethanol, prolonged intravenous administration times are required; and because the solvent has caused hypersensitivity reactions, a premedication schedule is required. ABI-007 is a new anticancer medication containing the same active ingredient as Taxol, paclitaxel, but formulated as a protein-stabilized material that is suspended in salt water and administered intravenously. The time of administration is reduced, the dose of paclitaxel can be higher than is safe for Taxol, and there is no premedication required.

This study will determine the efficacy of this new formulation of paclitaxel, as compared to Taxol, for patients with metastatic breast cancer.

This is an open label comparative study, so patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the Taxol or ABI-007 forms of paclitaxel, but will know what medication they are receiving. Treatment will be repeated every three weeks unless adverse events or treatment failure require discontinuing study medication.",NO,"Breast Neoplasms|Metastases, Neoplasm",DRUG: ABI-007,,,,Celgene Corporation,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,460,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CA012-0,2001-06,,,2002-10-03,,2006-07-13,"Abraxis Bioscience, Inc, Durham, North Carolina, 27703, United States",
