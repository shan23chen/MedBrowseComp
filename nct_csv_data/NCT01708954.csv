NCT01708954,Erlotinib Hydrochloride and Cabozantinib-s-Malate Alone or in Combination as Second or Third Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01708954,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving erlotinib hydrochloride and cabozantinib-s-malate alone or in combination works as second or third line therapy in treating patient with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride and cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with cabozantinib-s-malate is more effective than erlotinib hydrochloride or cabozantinib-s-malate alone in treating non-small cell lung cancer.,YES,Recurrent Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma|Stage IV Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7,DRUG: Cabozantinib S-malate|DRUG: Erlotinib Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients who had not experienced an event of interest by the time of analysis were censored at the date of last disease assessment., Assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2 - 5 years from study entry, up to 5 years","Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause or date of last known alive., Assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2 - 5 years from study entry, up to 5 years|Proportion of Patients With Objective Response, Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) evaluated using RECIST v 1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)., Assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2 - 5 years from study entry, up to 5 years|Proportion of Patients With MET Positivity, Submission of archival tissue for central MET IHC testing was required for this study, and total MET IHC testing was conducted at the Brigham and Women's Hospital using the c-Met clone CVD13 (arabbit polyclonal). Membranous and cytoplasmic staining were individually scored, and positivity was declared if MET was expressed in either the membrane or cytoplasm., Assessed at baseline|Proportion of Patients With Worst Grade Toxicities of Grade 3 or Higher, Assessed every 4 weeks while on treatment and for 30 days after the end of treatment",,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,125,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2012-01938|NCI-2012-01938|ECOG-E1512|CDR0000741879|E1512|E1512|U10CA180820|U10CA021115,2013-02-13,2015-08-14,2025-03-07,2012-10-17,2016-12-01,2025-03-25,"Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Memorial Medical Center, Modesto, California, 95355, United States|Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula, Monterey, California, 93940, United States|Stanford Cancer Institute Palo Alto, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Eisenhower Medical Center, Rancho Mirage, California, 92270, United States|The Medical Center of Aurora, Aurora, Colorado, 80012, United States|Boulder Community Hospital, Boulder, Colorado, 80301, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers-Boulder, Boulder, Colorado, 80304, United States|Penrose-Saint Francis Healthcare, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80907, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers-Penrose, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80907, United States|AdventHealth Porter, Denver, Colorado, 80210, United States|Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Presbyterian -
