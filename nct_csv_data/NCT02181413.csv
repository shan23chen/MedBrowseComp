PD was defined as ≥25% increase from lowest value in: serum/urine M component; participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels, the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels must be \>10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); participants without measurable serum, urine M-protein levels and FLC levels, bone marrow plasma cell percent must have been ≥10%; new bone lesions/soft tissue plasmacytomas development/existing bone lesions/soft tissue plasmacytomas size increase; hypercalcemia development., Randomization up to End of treatment (EOT) (24 months); thereafter followed up every 4 weeks (up to 45 months)","Overall Survival (OS), OS was measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death., Randomization up to end of follow up period (up to 107 months)|Percentage of Participants With Any Best Response Category Before PD or Subsequent Therapy, Response was assessed according to IMWG criteria. Best response includes partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR) and complete response (CR). PR as per IMWG criteria is 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to less than (\<)200 milligrams (mg) per 24 hours. VGPR is serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100 mg per 24 hours. CR is negative immunofixation of serum and urine and disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow. Stringent CR (sCR) is CR and normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal plasma cells (PCs) by immunohistochemistry or 2- to 4-color flow cytometry. The decimal values of percentages were subjected to rounding off., Randomization up to EOT (up to 24 months) and thereafter every 4 weeks until initiation of the next line of therapy (up to 107 months)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of PD, using IMWG criteria. PD is defined as ≥25% increase from lowest value in: serum/urine M-component; participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels, the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels must be \>10mg/dL; participants without measurable serum, urine M-protein levels and FLC levels, bone marrow plasma cell percent must be ≥10%;new bone lesions/soft tissue plasmacytomas development/existing bone lesions/soft tissue plasmacytomas size rise; hypercalcaemia development.

The maintenance of MRD negativity up to the end of treatment was assessed and reported in participants converting from MRD+ at Baseline to MRD negative. Bone marrow aspirates and blood samples were sent to a central laboratory and were assessed for MRD using flow cytometry and a sequencing methodology., Up to EOT (up to 24 months)|Correlation Between MRD Status and Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of PD as evaluated by an IRC according to IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, assessed for up to 107 months in this outcome measure., From randomization up to 107 months|Correlation Between MRD Status and Overall Survival (OS), OS was measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, assessed for up to 107 months in this outcome measure., From randomization up to 107 months|OS Benefits in a High-Risk Population, High-risk population included but was not limited to participants carrying deletion (del)17, t(4:14), t(14:16), amplification (ampl) 1q, del13, or del1p.

An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE was defined as an AE that started or worsened after first study drug administration and within 30 days of last dose of study drug. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, was a congenital abnormality or birth defect, an important medical event., Up to 107 months|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Values Reported as TEAEs, Laboratory tests included chemistry, hematology and urinalysis. Abnormal laboratory value was assessed as an AE if the value led to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or was considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. A TEAE was defined as an AE that started or worsened after first study drug administration and within 30 days of last dose of study drug., Up to 107 months|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) Domain Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire used to assess the health-related quality of life of cancer patients. GHS/QoL domain is based on questions 29 (""How would you rate your overall health during the past week?"") and 30 (""How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?"") of the EORTC QLQ-C30 where the study participants' self-reported responses to the questions on a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). The raw GHS/QoL domain scores were linearly transformed to a scale ranging 0 (worse outcome) to 100 (best outcome), with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL domain was evaluated by treatment group., Baseline up to EOT (up to Month 24)|Plasma Concentration of Ixazomib, Plasma concentrations of the complete hydrolysis product of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib) were measured using a validated Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assay., Day 1 of Cycle 1: 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose; Predose on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 2, Day 1 of Cycles 3 through 10 (each cycle length= 28 days)|Time to Resolution of Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) Events, Peripheral neuropathy is defined as the TEAE in the high-level term of peripheral neuropathies not elsewhere classified (NEC) according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

Time to improvement is defined as the time from the initial onset date (inclusive) of the maximum grade to the first onset date that the toxicity grade is below the maximum grade with no higher grade thereafter, or the resolution date, whichever occurs first., Up to 107 months|Time to Improvement of PN Events, PN is defined as the treatment-emergent adverse event in the high-level term of peripheral neuropathies not elsewhere classified (NEC) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). A PN event is considered as resolved if its final outcome is resolved with no subsequent PN event of the same preferred term occurring on the resolution date or the day before and after. A PN event is considered as improved if the event improves from the maximum grade. That is, all the grades recorded after the maximum grade is less than the maximum grade. Time to improvement is defined as the time from the initial onset date (inclusive) of the maximum grade to the first onset date that the toxicity grade is below the maximum grade with no higher grade thereafter, or the resolution date, whichever occurs first., Up to 107 months",,Takeda,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,656,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",C16019|U1111-1155-8695|2013-002076-41|C16019CTIL|NL.47795.029.14|173116|1036024001|SNCTP000001745,2014-07-16,2018-04-16,2023-09-08,2014-07-04,2019-05-07,2024-11-19,"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Mayo Clinic - PPDS, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, 10467, United States|Penn State Health Milton S.
