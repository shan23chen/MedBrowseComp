Final scores are transformed such that they range from 0 - 100, whereby higher scores indicate greater functioning, greater quality of life, or a greater degree of symptoms, with changes of 5 - 10 points considered to be of minimally important difference to participants. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement., Baseline and Cycle 4 Day 1 (Cy4D1)|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CLL16 Questionnaire Score, EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-CLL16) module was used to assess patient-reported outcomes and symptom burden.
