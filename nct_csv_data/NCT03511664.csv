NCT03511664,Study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 In Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03511664,VISION,COMPLETED,The primary objective of this study was to compare the two alternate primary endpoints of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with progressive prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who received 177Lu-PSMA-617 in addition to best supportive/best standard of care (BSC/BSoC) versus patients treated with best supportive/best standard of care alone.,YES,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: 177Lu-PSMA-617|OTHER: Best supportive/best standard of care,"Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of radiographic disease progression based on the central review assessment per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or death due to any cause. Patients who were alive without radiographic progression at the analysis data cut-off were censored for rPFS at the time of their last evaluable radiographic assessment. Date of censoring for rPFS: 1) The censoring date was the date when the last evaluable radiographic assessment (CT/MRI/bone scan) determined a lack of progression; 2) If there were no evaluable assessments, censoring occurred at the date of randomization; 3) Patients who had 2 or more consecutive missed tumor assessments immediately prior to PD or death were censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to those missing tumor assessments., From date of randomization until date of radiographic progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 32 months (Primary Analysis cut-off date = 27-Jan-2021)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If the patient was not known to have died, then OS was censored. The censoring date was date of the last study visit, or contact, until the cut-off date. The cut-off date was not used for last contact date, unless the patient was seen or contacted on that date.

Final OS was analyzed at the time of Primary analysis (Primary Analysis cut-off date = 27-Jan-2021) and an updated descriptive analysis of OS was re-run at the time of final analysis (Final Analysis cut-off date 14-Dec-2023)., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 32 months (Primary Analysis cut-off date = 27-Jan-2021) and up to 66 months (Final Analysis cut-off date = 14-Dec-2023)","Number of Participants With Randomized/Study Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), In the Main Study, ""randomized treatment"" refers to the investigational arm (AAA617+BSC/BSoC) and the control arm (BSC/BSoC).

The higher the BPI-SF score, the worse the pain. The BPI-SF consists of 4 questions regarding pain intensity (worst pain intensity, least pain intensity, average pain intensity and pain right now), 2 questions on the use of analgesics, and 7 questions on how the level pain has interfered with the subject's life (General Activity, Mood, Walking Ability, Normal Work, Relations with other people, Sleep, Enjoyment of Life).

EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions. A utility score was obtained by using a weighted combination of the levels of the five dimension-scales. The weights were based on value sets which were country-specific for the U.K. Utility scores ranges from the lowest possible score for a living patient of -0.594 (when all responses are '5') to 1 (when all responses are '1').If a patient died, he was assigned a score of 0 on the date of death., Baseline (BL), Cycle 2 to Cycle 13 (Week 1 Day 1), End of Treatment (EoT) (cycle duration for Cycle 1-6 = 6 weeks and for Cycle 7 and beyond = 12 weeks)|Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life (EuroQol) - 5 Domain 5 Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) EQ-VAS, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life.
