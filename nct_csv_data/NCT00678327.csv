NCT00678327,"Fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT Imaging in Assessing Response to Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Hodgkin Lymphoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00678327,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET/CT scan, done before, during, and after chemotherapy may help doctors assess a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. It is not yet known whether FDG-PET/CT imaging is effective in assessing response to chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying FDG-PET/CT imaging to see how well it works in assessing response to chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed stage II, stage III, or stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma.",NO,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: bleomycin sulfate|BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|BIOLOGICAL: pegfilgrastim|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: dacarbazine|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: prednisolone|DRUG: procarbazine hydrochloride|DRUG: vinblastine sulfate|DRUG: vincristine sulfate,"3-year progression-free survival, 3 years","Overall survival, 5 years after last patient recruited|Acute and chronic toxicity as assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0, 5 years after last patient recruited",,"University College, London",Cancer Research UK|Cancer Research UK & UCL Cancer Trials Centre,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1202,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000593562|CRUK-2007-006064-30|CRUK-07/146,2008-08-29,2016-01-31,2024-05-01,2008-05-15,,2024-05-08,"Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, England, SO16 6YD, United Kingdom",
