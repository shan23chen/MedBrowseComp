NCT00685646,Androgen Blockade Therapy With or Without Zoledronic Acid in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00685646,ZAPCA,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen blockade therapy may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Zoledronic acid may help relieve some of the symptoms caused by bone metastasis. It is not yet known whether androgen-blockade therapy is more effective with or without zoledronic acid in treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to the bone.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying androgen-blockade therapy given together with zoledronic acid to see how well it works compared with androgen-blockade therapy alone in treating patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases.",NO,Metastatic Cancer|Prostate Cancer,DRUG: antiandrogen therapy|DRUG: zoledronic acid,"Time to treatment failure (TTF), The interval from the date of randomization to the earliest date on which prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, clinical progression, first skeletal-related events (SRE), death, or cessation of protocol treatment for any reason occurred., 6 years","Time to first skeletal-related events (SRE), The interval from the date of randomization to the earliest date of the first SRE or death for any reason.
