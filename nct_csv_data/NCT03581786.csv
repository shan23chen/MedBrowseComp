NCT03581786,The Efficacy and Safety Study of TORIPALIMAB INJECTION Combined With Chemotherapy for Nasophapyngeal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03581786,,UNKNOWN,"This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, double blinded, Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of TORIPALIMAB INJECTIO（JS001） in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin compared with placebo in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin as first-line treatment in patients with histological/cytological confirmation of recurrent or metastatic NPC. The primary endpoint is PFS in all patients. Approximately 280 patients who fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms. patients will be randomly assigned to the combination of JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) with gemcitabine and cisplatin given every 3 weeks (Q3W) in 3-week cycles.",YES,Recurrent or Metastatic NPC,BIOLOGICAL: TORIPALIMAB INJECTION(JS001 ) combine with chemotherapy|DRUG: Placebos,"IRC-assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy，as measured by IRC-assessed progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1 in all patients.

The definition of Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increasein the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (thisincludes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. or the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., up to 2 years","OS, To evaluate the efficacy of TORIPALIMAB INJECTION(JS001 )plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by overall survival (OS).
