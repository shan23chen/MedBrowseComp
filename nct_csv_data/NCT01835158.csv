NCT01835158,Cabozantinib-s-malate or Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01835158,,COMPLETED,This randomized phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works compared to sunitinib malate in treating patients with previously untreated kidney cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body. Cabozantinib-s-malate and sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether cabozantinib-s-malate is more effective than sunitinib malate in treating patients with kidney cancer.,YES,Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma|Metastatic Kidney Carcinoma|Stage III Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v7,DRUG: Cabozantinib S-malate|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Sunitinib Malate,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) was investigator assessed and is measured from the beginning of treatment until patient progression or death. Progression was determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria, progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).The primary analysis will be based on the stratified log-rank statistic to compare the two treatment arms on PFS. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator will be used to estimate PFS distributions.Progression Free Survival was assessed per investigator, as this was the protocol-specified endpoint, and both investigator and independent review analyses of the PFS endpoint have been published, Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), The primary analysis will be based on the stratified log-rank statistic to compare the two treatment arms on OS. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator will be used to estimate OS distributions., Up to 5 years","Objective Response Rates, Objective response rates (ORR) was investigator assessed. ORR is the rate of complete or partial responses, based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. A response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. The Fisher exact test will be used to compare the two treatment arms., Up to 5 years",,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,157,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2013-00820|NCI-2013-00820|A031203|A031203|A031203|U10CA180821|U10CA031946,2013-07-08,2016-04-18,,2013-04-18,2018-12-21,2021-02-11,"Southern Cancer Center PC-Providence, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Alaska Breast Care and Surgery LLC, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Alaska Women's Cancer Care, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Anchorage Oncology Centre, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Katmai Oncology Group, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Providence Alaska Medical Center, Anchorage, Alaska, 99508, United States|Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center/Disney Family Cancer Center, Burbank, California, 91505, United States|Community Cancer Institute, Clovis, California, 93611, United States|University Oncology Associates, Clovis, California, 93611, United States|UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093, United States|San Diego VA Medical Center, San Diego, California, 92161, United States|UCSF Medical Center-Mount Zion, San Francisco, California, 94115, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers-Aurora, Aurora, Colorado, 80012, United States|The Medical Center of Aurora, Aurora, Colorado, 80012, United States|Boulder Community Hospital, Boulder, Colorado, 80301, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers-Boulder, Boulder, Colorado, 80304, United States|Penrose-Saint Francis Healthcare, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80907, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers-Penrose, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80907, United States|Porter Adventist Hospital, Denver, Colorado, 80210, United States|Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Presbyterian -
