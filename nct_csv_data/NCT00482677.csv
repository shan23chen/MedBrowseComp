NCT00482677,Radiation Therapy With or Without Temozolomide in Treating Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00482677,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and temozolomide are more effective than radiation therapy alone in treating glioblastoma multiforme.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and temozolomide to see how well they work compared with radiation therapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.",YES,Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors,DRUG: temozolomide|GENETIC: DNA methylation analysis|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|RADIATION: Radiation,"Overall Survival, Time from date of randomization to the date of death of any causes, or censored at last known alive date., 7 years","Progression-free Survival, Time from date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death whichever came first, or censored at last disease assessment date., 7 years|Adverse Events, Evaluated according to CTCAE V3.0, 7 years|Methylation Status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase Promoter, Overall survival for patients by Methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter, 7 years",,Canadian Cancer Trials Group,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC|Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group,ALL,OLDER_ADULT,PHASE3,562,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CE6|CAN-NCIC-CE6|EORTC-26062-22061|TROG 08.02|SPRI-CAN-NCIC-CE.6|CDR0000547163,2007-11-14,2016-03-01,2016-08-10,2007-06-05,2018-01-23,2023-08-22,"Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|BCCA - Fraser Valley Cancer Centre, Surrey, British Columbia, V3V 1Z2, Canada|BCCA - Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|BCCA - Vancouver Island Cancer Centre, Victoria, British Columbia, V8R 6V5, Canada|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|Atlantic Health Sciences Corporation, Saint John, New Brunswick, E2L 4L2, Canada|QEII Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1V7, Canada|Juravinski Cancer Centre at Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 5C2, Canada|London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, N6A 4L6, Canada|Odette Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Univ.
