NCT04188379,A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Efgartigimod in Adult Patients With Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP).,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04188379,ADVANCE,COMPLETED,"This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ARGX-113 in participants with primary ITP.",YES,Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia,BIOLOGICAL: efgartigimod|OTHER: Placebo,"Percentage of Participants With Chronic ITP With a Sustained Platelet Count Response Defined as Achieving Platelet Counts of at Least 50×10^9/L for at Least 4 of the 6 Visits Between Week 19 and 24 of the Trial., Percentage of participants with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response was defined as achieving platelet counts of at least 50 × 10\^9/L for at least 4 of the 6 visits between Week 19 and 24 of the study., From Week 19 up to Week 24","Extent of Disease Control Defined as the Number of Cumulative Weeks Over the Planned 24-week Treatment Period With Platelet Counts of ≥50×10^9/L in the Chronic ITP Population, Extent of disease control, defined as the cumulative number of weeks over the planned 24-week treatment period with platelet counts of ≥50 × 10\^9/L in the chronic ITP population., From Week 1 up to Week 24|Percentage of Participants With a Sustained Platelet Count Response for at Least 4 of the 6 Visits Between Week 19 and 24 of the Study, Percentage of participants in the overall population (chronic and persistent ITP) with a sustained platelet count response, defined as achieving platelet counts of at least 50 × 10\^9/L for at least 4 of the 6 visits between weeks 19 and 24 of the study., From Week 19 up to Week 24|Incidence and Severity of the WHO-classified Bleeding Events, Incidence of the World Health Organization (WHO)-classified bleeding events in the overall population.

This secondary endpoint used the WHO-classified bleeding scale. Bleeding was the predominant clinical manifestation of ITP and was typically related to platelet count. Accordingly, measuring bleeding was important for monitoring this participant population., From Week 1 to Week 24|Percentage of Participants in the Overall Population Achieving Platelet Counts of at Least 50×10^9/L for at Least 6 of the 8 Visits Between Week 17 and Week 24, Percentage of participants in the overall population achieving platelet counts of at least 50 × 10\^9/L for at least 6 of
