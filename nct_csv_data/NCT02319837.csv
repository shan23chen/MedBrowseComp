Radiographic progression for soft tissue disease was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Radiographic progression for bone disease was defined as the appearance of 1 or more metastatic lesions on bone scan (a bone scan assesses 5 regions of the skeleton, including skull, thorax, spine, pelvis, and extremities). Confirmation with a second imaging modality (plain film, computed tomography \[CT\], or magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\]) was to be required when bone lesions were found in a single region on the bone scan. Appearance of metastatic lesions in 2 or more of the 5 regions on a bone scan was not to require confirmation with a second imaging modality., From randomization until radiographic progression or death without radiographic progression, whichever occurred first (up to Month 98 when at least 197 MFS events occurred among the 3 treatment groups)","Metastasis-free Survival (MFS) Compared Between Enzalutamide Monotherapy and Placebo Plus Leuprolide, MFS was defined as the duration of time in months between randomization and the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression by central imaging or death without radiographic progression, whichever occurred first.
