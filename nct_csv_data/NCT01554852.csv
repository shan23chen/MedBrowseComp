NCT01554852,"Use of Thalidomide, Lenalidomide, Carfilzomib, Bortezomib and Vorinostat in the Initial Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01554852,Myeloma XI,UNKNOWN,"The purpose of this study is to compare a standard chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone plus thalidomide with a newer regimen of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone plus lenalidomide with or without carfilzomib.

Patients who do not have the best response to their initial treatment may then also be given a combination of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone plus bortezomib.

Patients who are relatively fit may, on their doctor's advice, go on to receive more intensive chemotherapy, supported with a transplant of their own blood cells. This is standard treatment which patients may be offered anyway even if they didn't take part in this study.

After maximal response has been achieved with the treatment described above, and as long as the myeloma has not got worse, patients will be treated with either long-term lenalidomide, lenalidomide with vorinostat, or receive no further treatment, with close observation.",NO,Multiple Myeloma,"DRUG: Induction (intensive pathway) - cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, & dexamethasone (CRD) regimen|DRUG: Induction (intensive pathway) - cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, & dexamethasone (CTD) regimen|DRUG: Induction (intensive pathway) - carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, & dexamethasone (CCRD) regimen|DRUG: Induction (non-intensive pathway) - cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, & dexamethasone attenuated (CRDa) regimen|DRUG: Induction (non-intensive pathway) - cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, & dexamethasone attenuated (CTDa) regimen|DRUG: Consolidation (intensive & non-intensive pathways) - bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, & dexamethasone (VCD) regimen|DRUG: Maintenance (intensive & non-intensive pathways) - lenalidomide maintenance|DRUG: Maintenance (intensive & non-intensive pathways - protocol v5.0 only) - lenalidomide plus vorinostat maintenance|DRUG: High dose melphalan therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (intensive pathway only)","Overall survival, Overall survival for induction chemotherapy comparisons is defined as the time from initial randomisation to the trial to death from any cause or last follow-up.
