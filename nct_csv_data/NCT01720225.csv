NCT01720225,Decitabine Versus Azacitidine in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients With Low and Intermediate-1 Risk,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01720225,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical research study is to compare how two different drugs, decitabine and azacitidine, when given on a shorter than standard dosing schedule can help to control MDS. The safety of the drugs will also be studied.

Decitabine is designed to damage the DNA (the genetic material) of cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.

Azacitidine is designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells whose job is to stop the function of the tumor-fighting proteins. By blocking the ""bad"" proteins, the tumor-fighting genes may be able to work better. This could cause the cancer cells to die.",YES,Leukemia,DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Azacitidine,"Participants With a Response, Overall Response = complete remission (CR) + partial remission (PR) + marrow CR (mCR) + hematologic improvement (HI). CR is normalization of peripheral blood and bone marrow with \<5% bone marrow blasts, a peripheral blood granulocyte count \> (1.0 x 10\^9/L, and platelet count \> 100 x 10\^9/L). PR is same as CR except for the presence of 6-15% marrow blasts, or 50% reduction if \<15% at start of treatment. Marrow CR is blasts \</= 5% and decreased by \>/=50% from baseline. HI is platelets increase by 50% and to above 30 x 10\^9/L untransfused (if lower than that pre-therapy; or hemoglobin increase by 2 g/dl; or transfusion independent; or splenomegaly reduction by \> 50%; or monocytosis reduction by \> 50% if pretreatment \> 5 X1 0\^9/L., 56 days","Number of Participants Who Became Transfusion Independent, Participants who were transfusion dependent at baseline prior to starting therapy on the Decitabine or Azacitidine arm will be analyzed for transfusion independence.
