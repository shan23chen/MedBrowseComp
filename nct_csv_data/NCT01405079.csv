NCT01405079,Gefitinib Versus Vinorelbine/Platinum as Adjuvant Treatment in Stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC With EGFR Mutation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01405079,ADJUVANT,UNKNOWN,Activating somatic mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been characterized in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC.The EGFR mutation rate was 30% in Chinese Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC). Patients harboring these mutations in their tumors show excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). This randomized phase III trial is studying gefitinib to see how well it works compared to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation in Asian population.,NO,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Vinorelbine+Cisplatin,"Disease free survival, To evaluate the disease free survival of gefitinib versus combination of vinorelbine plus platinum as adjuvant treatment for pathological stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC with EGFR mutation.Disease free survival (DFS)- defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Pts after surgery will receive long-term follow-up including chest CT scan, abdominal ultrasound every 3 months, brain MRI every 6 months, bone scan every 12 months for up to 3 years. The survival after 3 years will be followed up with telephone.","Overall survival, To evaluate the overall survival of gefitinib versus combination of vinorelbine plus platinum as adjuvant treatment for stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC with EGFR mutation., Pts after surgery will receive long-term follow-up including chest CT scan, abdominal ultrasound every 3 months, brain MRI every 6 months, bone scan every 12 months for up to 3 years. The survival after 3 years will be followed up with telephone.|3 yeas DFS rate, 5 years DFS rate, 5 years OS rate, To compare the randomized treatment arms in terms of 3 yeas DFS rate, 5 years DFS rate, 5 years OS rate., Pts after surgery will receive long-term follow-up including chest CT scan, abdominal ultrasound every 3 months, brain MRI every 6 months, bone scan every 12 months for up to 3 years. The survival after 3 years will be followed up with telephone.|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability profile of gefitinib at a 250 mg daily dose relative to that of Chemotherapy., In the period of Gefitinib 250 mg/day oral daily for 24 months.Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 intravenous infusion on day 1 and day 8, Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 for 4 cycles.|The Total Score and TOI of FACT-L to Measure Quality of life, Quality of life as measured by the total score and Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung Cancer (FACT-L) questionnaire., In the period of Gefitinib 250 mg/day oral daily for 24 months.Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 intravenous infusion on day 1 and day 8, Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 for 4 cycles.",,Guangdong Association of Clinical Trials,"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital|First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University|Sun Yat-sen University|Jilin Provincial Tumor Hospital|Liaoning Cancer Hospital & Institute|First Hospital of China Medical University|Chinese PLA General Hospital|Peking Union Medical College Hospital|Peking University People's Hospital|Beijing Chest Hospital|309th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army|Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute|Peking University First Hospital|Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital|The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University|Jiangsu Cancer Institute & Hospital|The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University|Fudan University|Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai, China|Zhejiang Cancer Hospital|Zhejiang University|Wuhan Union Hospital, China|Tongji Hospital|West China Hospital|Tang-Du Hospital",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,222,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CTONG 1104|CTONG 1104,2011-09-19,2017-03,2020-12,2011-07-29,,2020-02-18,"Guangdong General Hospital, Guangzhou, China",
