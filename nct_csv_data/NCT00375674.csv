Recurrence refers to relapse of the primary tumor in-situ or at metastatic sites. Date of recurrence or occurrence: The date of the recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy for the first time, either by blinded independent central review (BICR) or investigator assessment for respective analyses. Participants were followed with tumor imaging for recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy for remainder of follow-up period unless the participant had withdrawn consent. According to the statistical analysis plan there are two cohorts: 1.Global Cohort: primary analysis of DFS was performed approximately 5 years after last participant in the Global Cohort is randomized; 2. China Cohort: primary analysis of DFS was performed approximately 3 years after the last participant in China Cohort was randomized., Every 12 weeks during the first 3 years and every 6 months after that unless the participant had withdrawn consent.

The questionnaire includes 28 items with 4-point Likert type responses from ""not at all"" to ""very much"" to assess functioning \& symptoms; 2 items with 7-point Likert scales for global health \& overall QoL. All responses were converted to a 0 to 100 scale using a standard scoring algorithm, higher scores represented better level for functioning/QoL \& more severe for symptoms., Cycle 1(Day 1); subsequent cycles (Day 1) and end of treatment/withdrawal (ie, up to 1 year)|PROs- EORTC QLQ C30: Functional Scale Scores Between Treatment Comparison, Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessed health-related quality of life (QoL) by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), which was a 30-item questionnaire with global QoL scale \& 5 multi-item functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, \& social functioning).

In this outcome measure, the first part with 5 descriptors of current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, \& anxiety/depression) was used; a participant was asked to rate each state on a 3-level scale (1=no problem, 2=some problem, \& 3=extreme problem); higher levels indicated greater severity/impairment. The published weights allowed the creation of a single summary score called the EQ-5D index, which ranged from -0.594 to 1; low scores represented a higher level of dysfunction \& 1 as perfect health., Cycle 1(Day 1); subsequent cycles (Day 1) and end of treatment/withdrawal (ie, up to 1 year)|PROs- EuroQol European Quality of Life Questionnaire Variable Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) Observed Means, Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessed health-related quality of life (QoL) by the EuroQoL Group health status questionnaire (EQ-5D), which was a brief self-administered, validated instrument with 2 parts. The first part assessed the current health state. In this outcome measure, the second part was applied to assess the general health status by using visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS) which measured participant's self-rated health status on a scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Cycle 1(Day 1); subsequent cycles (Day 1) and end of treatment/withdrawal (ie, up to 1 year)|Number of Participants With Tolerability Symptoms, Participants were followed for AEs from the first day of study treatment until at least 28 days after the last on-study treatment administration, or until all serious or study medication-related toxicities had resolved or were determined to be ""chronic"" or ""stable,"" whichever was later.
