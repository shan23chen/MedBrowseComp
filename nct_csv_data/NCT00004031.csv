NCT00004031,SWOG-9704 Chemoradiotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation Compared With Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00004031,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and radiation and kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether chemoradiotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemoradiotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",YES,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|DRUG: CHOP regimen|DRUG: carmustine|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: prednisone|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|PROCEDURE: bone marrow ablation with stem cell support|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"2-year Overall Survival Rates, Percentage of participants surviving 2 years post registration, up to 2 years post registration|2 Year Progression-free Survival, Percentage of participants without disease progression up to 2 years post-registration., From registration until death","Number of Patients With Gr 3 Through 5 Adverse Events That Are Related to Study Drugs, Adverse Events (AEs) are reported by CTCAE Version 2.0.
