NCT00785291,"Paclitaxel, Nab-paclitaxel, or Ixabepilone With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIC or Stage IV Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00785291,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial studies the side effects and how well different chemotherapy regimens with or without bevacizumab work in treating patients with stage IIIC or stage IV breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel), and ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may block tumor growth by targeting certain cells and slowing the growth of blood vessels to the tumor. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective in treating patients with breast cancer.",YES,Estrogen Receptor Negative|Estrogen Receptor Positive|HER2/Neu Negative|HER2/Neu Positive|Progesterone Receptor Negative|Progesterone Receptor Positive|Recurrent Breast Carcinoma|Stage IIIC Breast Cancer AJCC v6|Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7,BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Ixabepilone|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration,"Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from registration until first disease progression, regardless of site, or death resulting from any cause, which ever occurred first.

A responding participant had either a Complete Response (disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions)., Up to 5 years|Time to Treatment Failure, Time from registration until treatment failure, defined as early termination of protocol therapy for any reason, first disease progression or death without progression. Surviving participants who were failure free were censored as date last known alive and failure free.
