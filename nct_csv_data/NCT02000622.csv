NCT02000622,Assessment of the Efficacy and Safety of Olaparib Monotherapy Versus Physicians Choice Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Germline BRCA1/2 Mutations.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02000622,OlympiAD,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This open label, randomised, controlled, multi-centre phase III study will assess the efficacy and safety of single agent olaparib vs standard of care based on physician's choice of capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin in metastatic breast cancer patients with gBRCA 1/2 mutations.",YES,Breast Cancer Metastatic|BRCA 1 Gene Mutation|BRCA 2 Gene Mutation,DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Physician's choice chemotherapy,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) According to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1), Time from randomisation to the earliest of objective radiological progression or death by any cause in the absence of objective progression. Objective radiological progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every ~6 weeks up to 24 weeks, then every ~ 12 weeks thereafter until objective radiological disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of 30 months.","Time to Second Progression or Death (PFS2), Time from randomisation to the earliest of the progression event subsequent to the first objective radiological progression, or death. Second progression may involve any of; objective radiological or symptomatic progression or death. Objective radiological progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Symptomatic progression is assessed by investigators based on clinical examination., Second progression status reviewed every 8 weeks following the first objective radiological progression as per investigator assessment. Assessed up to a maximum of 30 months.|Overall Survival (OS), Time from randomisation until death due to any cause., Survival status reviewed every 3 weeks until treatment discontinued, then every 8 weeks. Assessed up to a maximum of 30 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Data Assessed by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1), Number of responders according to blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response = CR + PR., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every ~6 weeks up to 24 weeks, then every ~ 12 weeks thereafter until objective radiological disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of 30 months.|Adjusted Mean Change in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Score From the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Change from baseline in global health status/quality of life (QoL) score assessed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, including all post-baseline global health status/QoL scores up to the latest scheduled visit where at least 20 patients on each treatment arm have a score. Global health status/QoL score is on a scale from 0 to 100. A higher score represents an improved health status/QoL., EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments performed at baseline then every ~6 weeks until objective radiological disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of 30 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) According to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) in Patients Confirmed as Myriad CDx gBRCAm, Time from randomisation to the earliest of objective radiological progression or death by any cause in the absence of objective progression. Objective radiological progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Assessed in patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious variant in either of the BRCA genes using variants identified with current and future BRCA mutation assays (gene sequencing and large rearrangement analysis)., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every ~6 weeks up to 24 weeks, then every ~ 12 weeks thereafter until objective radiological disease progression.
