These included five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health status/quality of life (QoL) scale.

All of the scales and single items ranged from 0 to 100. A high scale score represented a higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale indicated a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the QoL indicated high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/single item indicated a high level of symptomatology/problems. Data from all collected time points were combined and presented using a repeated measures model for longitudinal data., Screening and treatment phase up to 92 months|EORTC QLQ-LC13 Time to Definitive Deterioration, The Lung Cancer module of the EORTC's quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-LC13) was used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and provided information on an additional 13 items specifically related to lung cancer. The lung cancer module incorporated one multi-item scale to assess dyspnea, and 9 single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. All of the domain scores ranged from 0 to 100. A high score indicated a high level of symptoms. QLQ-LC13 time to definitive deterioration was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date a patient shows a 10 point or higher increase from baseline in any of the ALCLC13 scores related to pain in chest, cough, or dyspnea (with no later change below this threshold), or death due to any cause. Each cycle was 21 days., Screening and treatment phase up to 92 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), The LCSS patient scale uses a 24-hour recall period and contains nine items: six measuring major symptoms for lung cancer (appetite loss, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, pain), and three summary items related to total symptom distress, normal activity status, and overall quality of life. The total scale used is a 100 mm visual analog scale to measure the intensity of patient responses, with zero corresponding to the lowest rating (best status) and 100 representing the highest rating (worst status). The total score was calculated as the mean of the 9 items. Data from all collected time points were combined and presented using a repeated measures model for longitudinal data., Screening and treatment phase up to 92 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the EQ-5D-5L Index, The EQ-5D descriptive classification consists of five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. Patients are requested to select the statement which best describes their condition on that day for each dimension. EQ-5D-5L index scores can range from -0.59 to 1, where 1 is the best possible health state. Data from all collected time points were combined and presented using a repeated measures model for longitudinal data., Screening and treatment phase up to 92 months|Least Squares Mean Scores on the EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The EQ-5D descriptive classification consists of five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. Patients are requested to select the statement which best describes their condition on that day for each dimension. EQ VAS scores can range from 0 to 100, where 100 is the best possible health state. Data from all collected time points were combined and presented using a repeated measures model for longitudinal data., Screening and treatment phase up to 92 months|Cmax for Ceritinib, The observed maximum plasma concentration following administration, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 2, Day 1: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post-dose.

Each cycle was 21 days.|Post-Hoc: All Collected Deaths, Pre-treatment deaths: from day of patient's informed consent to the day before first dose of study treatment. On-treatment deaths: from first dose of study treatment to 30 days following the last dose of study treatment at the end of treatment phase. For crossover patients, from first dose of ceritinib at the extension treatment phase to 30 days following the last dose.
