Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to discontinuation from the study, death or date of censoring, whichever occurred first (for a maximum duration of 41 months)","Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), BICR assessed PFS: Duration from randomization until disease progression (PD) or death. PD as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was smallest on study). In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. Appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier.
