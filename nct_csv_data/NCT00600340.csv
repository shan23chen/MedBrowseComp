Patients without recorded death were censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive. OS was analyzed at two looks, one interim look and the final analysis. Due to group sequential testing, the overall significance level alpha = 0.025 was spent on both looks according to Lan-DeMets spending method with O'Brien-Fleming-type boundaries. Alpha spent at Interim after 47% of information was 0.0010.
