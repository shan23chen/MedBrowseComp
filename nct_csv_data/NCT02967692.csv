Each cycle is 28 days|Randomized (Part 3): Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Per Investigator's Assessment by RECIST 1.1, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented radiological progression per investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause. The distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. If a patient had not had an event at the time of data cut-off, progression-free survival was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment., Up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 2.8 years (Part 3)","Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, Up to death due to any cause, assessed up to approximately 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Per Investigator's Assessment by RECIST 1.1, ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects with confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as per investigator's assessment by RECIST 1.1.

CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, Part 1: Up to 3.3 years.

Part 3: Up to 2.8 year|Randomized (Part 3): Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30- Global Health Status Scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was a 30-item questionnaire that patients complete, consisting of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. It included five functional scales, three symptom scales, six single items, and a Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) scale.

The GHS/QoL scale had seven possible response scores ranging from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent), which were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score on this scale indicated a better quality of life.

The change from baseline in GHS/QoL scores was calculated. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement in the patient's quality of life., From baseline to 60 days post progression, assessed up to 2.8 years (Part 3)|Randomized (Part 3): Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30- Physical Functioning Scale Scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was a patient completed 30 item questionnaire that was composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These included five functional scales, three symptom scales, six single items and a global health status/QoL scale.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale measured a patient's ability to carry out daily activities and tasks requiring physical exertion. It consisted of five questions asking patients to rate their level of physical functioning, with response options ranging from 1=""not at all"" to 4=""very much"". The scores for each item were summed and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better physical functioning.

The change from baseline in physical functioning scale scores was calculated. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement in physical functioning., From baseline to 60 days post progression, assessed up to 2.8 years (Part 3)|Randomized (Part 3): Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30- Pain Symptom Scale Scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was a patient completed 30 item questionnaire that was composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These included five functional scales, three symptom scales, six single items and a global health status/QoL scale.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 pain symptom scale was one of the symptom scales in the questionnaire, which measured the severity of pain experienced by the patient. The pain symptom scale consisted of two items, one measuring the severity of pain and the other measuring the use of painkillers. The items were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1=""not at all"" to 4=""very much"". The scores for each item were summed and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain.

The change from baseline in pain symptom scale scores was calculated. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement., From baseline to 60 days post progression, assessed up to 2.8 years (Part 3)|Randomized (Part 3): Time to 10 Point Definitive Deterioration in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30- Global Health Status, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was a patient completed 30 item questionnaire that was composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These included five functional scales, three symptom scales, six single items and a global health status/QoL scale.

The GHS/QoL scale had seven possible response scores ranging from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent), which were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score on this scale indicated a better quality of life.

The time to definitive 10 point deterioration is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of event, which is defined as at least 10 points relative to baseline worsening of the GHS/QoL score or death due to any cause. If a subject had not had an event, the time to deterioration was censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. The distribution was estimated using KM method., From baseline to date of at least 10 points relative to baseline worsening of the global health status score or death due to any cause, up to 2.8 years (Part 3)|Randomized (Part 3): Change From Baseline in Function Assessment Cancer Therapy-melanoma (FACT-M) Melanoma Subscale Score, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M) quality of life questionnaire was composed of the FACT-General (FACT-G) plus the Melanoma Subscale and the Melanoma Surgery Subscale, which complemented the general scale with items specific to quality of life (QoL) in melanoma.

The Melanoma Subscale of FACT-M included 16 questions, with response options of 0= ""Not at all"", 1= ""a little bit"", 2= ""somewhat"", 3= ""quite a bit"" and 4= ""very much"". The FACT-M melanoma subscale score ranged from 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life in relation to melanoma.

The change from baseline in melanoma subscale scores was calculated. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement., From baseline to 60 days post progression, assessed up to 2.8 years (Part 3)|Randomized (Part 3): Change From Baseline in EuroQoL 5-level Instrument (EQ-5D-5L)- Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized questionnaire used to assess health-related quality of life, and it includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS score is obtained by asking the individual to rate their current health status on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst possible health state and 100 represents the best possible health state.

The change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L VAS score was calculated. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement in the health status., From baseline to 60 days post progression, assessed up to 2.8 years (Part 3)|Randomized (Part 3): PFS as Per Investigator's Assessment by RECIST 1.1 by PD-L1 Expression, PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented radiological progression as per investigator's assessment using RECIST 1.1 response criteria or death due to any cause. The distribution of PFS was estimated using the KM method. If a patient had not had an event at the time of data cut-off, progression-free survival was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.

PFS analysis was performed by PD-L1 status (positive, negative) where a positive status was defined as having ≥ 1% expression and a negative status was defined as having \< 1% expression., Up to disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 2.8 years (Part 3)|Randomized (Part 3): OS by PD-L1 Expression, OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause.
