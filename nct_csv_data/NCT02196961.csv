NCT02196961,Adjuvant Therapy of Completely Resected Merkel Cell Carcinoma With Immune Checkpoint Blocking Antibodies vs Observation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02196961,ADMEC-O,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Primary objective: To estimate the efficacy of adjuvant nivolumab monotherapy in completely resected MCC patients

Primary endpoint: Disease-free survival (DFS) rate evaluated at 12, 24 and 48 months after date of randomization

Secondary Objectives: To describe the safety profile and additional efficacy parameters of the nivolumab treatment in MCC

Secondary endpoints:

* Adverse events according to CTCAE, Version 4.0 criteria, that are related to the administration of nivolumab
* Disease-free survival (DFS)
* Overall survival (OS) and OS rates at 12, 24 and 48 months after randomization

Explorative Endpoints:

* Distant-metastases-free survival (DMFS) and DMFS rate at 12, 24 and 48 months after randomization
* Identification and validation of prognostic/predictive biomarkers
* Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) until 24 months after randomization",NO,Merkel Cell Carcinoma,DRUG: Nivolumab,"Disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 12 months, The number of patients alive and free of disease at 12 months after randomization in arm A compared to DFS in arm B., 1 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 24 months, The number of patients alive and free of disease at 24 months after randomization, 2 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 48 months, The number of patients alive and free of disease at 48 months after randomization, 4 years post last patient first treatment/randomization","Number of adverse events, Adverse events according to CTCAE, Version 4.0 criteria, that are related to the administration of Ipilimumab, 1, 2 and 4 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Overall survival rate at 12 months, Overall survival rate at 12 months, defined as the number of patients alive at 12 months after randomization divided by the total number of patients randomized., 1 year post last patient first treatment/randomization|Overall survival rate at 24 months, Overall survival rate at 24 months, defined as the number of patients alive at 24 months after randomization divided by the total number of patients randomized., 2 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Overall survival rate at 48 months, Overall survival rate at 48 months, defined as the number of patients alive at 48 months after randomization divided by the total number of patients randomized., 4 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Disease-free survival (DFS), Time from randomization to recurrence of tumor, 1, 2 and 4 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization to death of patient, 1, 2 and 4 years post last patient first treatment/randomization","Distant-metastases-free survival (DMFS) at 12 months after randomization, Number of patients free of distant metastases at 12 months after randomization, 1 year post last patient first treatment/randomization|Distant-metastases-free survival (DMFS) at 24 months after randomization, Number of patients free of distant metastases at 24 months after randomization, 2 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Distant-metastases-free survival (DMFS) at 48 months after randomization, Number of patients free of distant metastases at 48 months after randomization, 4 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Identification of prognostic/predictive biomarkers, Identify and validate prognostic/predictive biomarkers such as immune status, kinetics of the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), or tumor microenvironment characteristics, 2 and 4 years post last patient first treatment/randomization|Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) until 24 months after randomization, The patient's quality of life will be evaluated at baseline (pretreatment visit) and every 3 months until 24 months after randomization using a standard questionnaire, 2 years post last patient first treatment/randomization",Prof. Dr. med.
