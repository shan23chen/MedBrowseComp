NCT01277016,A Trial for Systemic Light-chain (AL) Amyloidosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01277016,EMN-03,COMPLETED,"In this multi-center phase III trial, untreated patients diagnosed with AL who are not candidates for stem cell transplant with melphalan 200 mg/m2 are the target population. Stage I and II patients will be eligible. Stage III patients will be enrolled in an ancillary phase II study. Eligible patients will be stratified as cardiac stage I or stage II and then randomized to receive MDex or BMDex.

Primary objective is to compare hematologic(clonal) response i.e. the rate of complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) defined according to the criteria of the International Society for Amyloidosis consensus.",NO,AL Amyloidosis,DRUG: BMDex,"Number of Patients in CR and PR measured by level of serum light chain monoclonal protein, As defined by the International Society for Amyloidosis consensus.

Complete response:

* serum and urine IF negative,
* normal FLC ratio,
* bone marrow PC \<5%

Partial response if:

* serum monoclonal \>0.5 g/dL, a 50% reduction,
* FLC in urine visible and \>100 mg/day and 50% reduction,
* FLC \>2 times upper normal and 50% reduction.

Progressive disease

* from CR, abnormal FLC ratio
* from PR or stable disease, 50% increase in monoclonal protein to \>0.5 g/dL, or 50% increase in urine to \>200 mg/day, or FLC increase of 50% to \>100 mg/L.

Stable disease: no CR, no PR, no progression., 3 cycles of therapy","Compare haematology response, To compare in patients treated with MDex or BMDex:

* complete hematologic response rate after 3 cycles and after completion of therapy;
* hematologic response rate at completion of therapy;
* organ response rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months;
* treatment-related mortality;
* toxicity;
* overall and progression-free survival;
* time to hematologic and organ response;
* quality of life., 2 years",,European Myeloma Network B.V.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,110,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EMN-03|2010-022395-31,2011-01,2016-02,2016-07-31,2011-01-14,,2017-03-10,"Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Pavia, Italy",
