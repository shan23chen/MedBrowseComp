NCT02500121,Testing the PD-1 Inhibitor Pembrolizumab as Maintenance Therapy After Initial Chemotherapy in Metastatic Bladder Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02500121,,COMPLETED,"This is a multi-institutional, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded phase II trial of maintenance pembrolizumab versus placebo after first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who have achieved at least stable disease on first-line chemotherapy.",YES,Urothelial Carcinoma|Bladder Cancer,OTHER: Placebo|DRUG: Pembrolizumab,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), Measured at the time from randomization to death or progression, depending on which occurs first, as per immune-related RECIST (irRECIST). Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, Calculated after a median follow-up time of 12.9 months","6-month PFS as Per irRECIST, Probability that subjects remain alive and progression free at 6 months post randomization per irRECIST criteria. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Six months after randomization|Number of Subjects With Adverse Events as a Measure of the Safety and Tolerability of Pembrolizumab, Percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent grade 3-4 toxicities, as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0, Every 3 weeks beginning with C1D1 for up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Assessment of Subjects on Maintenance Pembrolizumab vs Placebo, The objective response rate is the percentage of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment)

Complete Response per RECIST 1.1 is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and the reduction in size of any pathologic lymph nodes to \<10mm in the absence of the appearance of any new lesions.

Partial Response per RECIST 1.1 is defined by at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions when compared to baseline, no equivocal progression of non-target disease and no appearance of new lesions., Response assessed every 12 weeks from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first, assessed for up to a maximum of 104 weeks (24 months)|ORR Assessment of Subjects Receiving Pembrolizumab After Progressing on Placebo, The objective response rate is the percentage of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment)

Complete Response per RECIST 1.1 is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and the reduction in size of any pathologic lymph nodes to \<10mm in the absence of the appearance of any new lesions.
