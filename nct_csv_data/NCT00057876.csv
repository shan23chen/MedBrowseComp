NCT00057876,Gemcitabine With or Without Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00057876,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without radiation therapy in treating pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.",YES,Pancreatic Cancer,DRUG: Gemcitabine|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Overall Survival Time, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization (registration) to death from any cause. Patients alive at last follow-up were censored. Patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for year 3. Patients received treatment beyond 3 years were also followed for survival., assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for year 3","Progression-free Survival Time, Time from randomization (registration) to the earlier of disease progression or death. Patients alive and progression-free at last follow-up were censored. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter), or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for year 3. Patients who received treatment beyond 3 years were also followed for survival., assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for year 3|Overall Response, Response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) by CT. Overall response included complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR was defined as CR of target lesions and persistence of one or more non-target lesions or at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions and non-progressive disease in the non-target lesions. The 71 eligible, treated participants were included in the analysis., assessed at week 8, and every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for year 3",,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Radiation Therapy Oncology Group,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,74,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000278947|U10CA021115|E4201,2003-08-29,2009-05,2009-05,2003-04-09,2011-03-25,2023-07-05,"Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006, United States|Saint Joseph's Mercy Cancer Center, Hot Springs, Arkansas, 71913, United States|California Cancer Center - Woodward Park Office, Fresno, California, 93720, United States|Doctors Medical Center, Modesto, California, 95350, United States|Memorial Medical Center Cancer Services, Modesto, California, 95355, United States|North Colorado Medical Center, Greeley, Colorado, 80631, United States|McKee Medical Center, Loveland, Colorado, 80539, United States|Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut, 06030, United States|New Britain General Hospital, New Britain, Connecticut, 06050, United States|Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center at Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520-8032, United States|William W.
