NCT00363025,A Randomized Study of Post-Remission Therapy in Elderly Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00363025,,TERMINATED,"In this ALFA-9803 trial in AML patients aged 65 years or more, we randomly compared idarubicin or daunorubicin throughout the study (first randomization) and two different post-remission strategies (second randomization): one single intensive consolidation course similar to induction versus six ambulatory cycles with one dose of idarubicin/daunorubicin (day 1) and 2x60 mg/m2/d cytarabine SC (day 1 to 5) delivered in out-patients on a monthly basis. Primary endpoint was 2-year overall survival (OS). Study hypotheses were equivalence for the idarubicin/daunorubicin comparison and a 15% difference in 2-year OS for the post-remission therapy comparison.",NO,Acute Myeloid Leukemia,PROCEDURE: Two post-remission strategies|DRUG: Idarubicin versus daunorubicin,Overall survival,Complete remission rate|Induction death rate,,Acute Leukemia French Association,Assistance Publique - HÃ´pitaux de Paris,ALL,OLDER_ADULT,PHASE3,465,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,ALFA-9803,1999-11,,2006-04,2006-08-15,,2008-02-21,"Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France|Hopital Percy, Clamart, France|Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France|CHU, Lille, France|CHU, Limoges, France|Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France|Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France|Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France|CHU, Rouen, France|CNLCC, Rouen, France|CNLCC, Saint-Cloud, France|CH, Versailles, France|IGR, Villejuif, France",
