NCT00525148,"LUX Lung 2 Phase II Single Arm BIBW 2992 ""Afatinib"" in NSCLC With EGFR Activating Mutations",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00525148,,COMPLETED,"The primary objective of this open-label, single arm Phase II trial is to explore the efficacy of BIBW 2992 defined by the objective response rate (CR, PR) as determined by RECIST criteria in patients with advanced NSCLC Stage IIIB or IV whose tumors harbor activating mutations within exon 18 to exon 21 of the EGFR receptor. Patients progressing or relapsing after one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen as well as chemotherapy naïve patients (only in stage 2) will be allowed to enter into the trial.",YES,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",DRUG: BIBW 2992,"Objective Response (OR) as Determined by RECIST 1.0, Objective response (OR) was assessed for all treated patients by independent review as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0. OR included complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), where CR or PR must have been confirmed by a subsequent response in ≥28 days., Response assessment is done at end of Week 4 (after Course 1), Week 8 (after Course 2), Week 12 (after Course 3) and at 8-week intervals thereafter, up to 93 months.","Clinical Benefit as Determined by RECIST 1.0, Clinical benefit was evaluated according to RECIST 1.0 by independent review assessment. Patients whose best RECIST 1.0 assessment was stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) were considered to have derived a clinical benefit from treatment., Response assessment is done at end of Week 4 (after Course 1), Week 8 (after Course 2), Week 12 (after Course 3) and at 8-week intervals thereafter, up to 93 months.|Duration of Clinical Benefit, Duration of clinical benefit (disease control) as per independent review was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the time of progression or death (whichever occurred first), among patients with evidence of SD, PR or CR., Response assessment is done at end of Week 4 (after Course 1), Week 8 (after Course 2), Week 12 (after Course 3) and at 8-week intervals thereafter, up to 93 months.|Duration of Objective Response, Duration of objective response (OR) was measured from the time the criteria for CR or PR (whichever was documented first) were first met until the first date that progressive disease or death (or date of censoring for PFS) was objectively documented as per independent review., Response assessment is done at end of Week 4 (after Course 1), Week 8 (after Course 2), Week 12 (after Course 3) and at 8-week intervals thereafter, up to 93 months.|Time to Objective Response, Time to objective response was defined as the number of days from the start of treatment to the first recorded objective response. Patients who did not experience objective response during the study were censored at the time of treatment discontinuation.

The results are provided as the percentage of participants for this Outcome Measure., Response assessment is done at end of Week 4 (after Course 1), Week 8 (after Course 2), Week 12 (after Course 3) and at 8-week intervals thereafter, up to 93 months.|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) as per independent review was defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment until the day of objective tumor progression was confirmed by tumor imaging (Progressive Disease according to RECIST 1.0) or death, whichever came first. Patients with unknown progression status or unknown date of progression were reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Patients known to be alive without progression at the end of the trial or the last follow-up visit were censored at the date of the last imaging when the patient was known to be alive and progression-free. Medians are calculated from the Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% confidence intervals, using Greenwood's standard error estimate., Response assessment is done at end of Week 4 (after Course 1), Week 8 (after Course 2), Week 12 (after Course 3) and at 8-week intervals thereafter, up to 93 months.|Overall Survival Time, Overall survival time (OS) was also evaluated and was defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death up to 93 months, regardless of the cause of death. Medians are calculated from the Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% confidence intervals, using Greenwood's standard error estimate., Start of treatment to time to all death, up to 93 months|Cpre,ss,29, Predose concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state immediately before administration of the 29th dose (Cpre,ss,29)., -0:05h (pre-dose) on Day 29|Safety of BIBW 2992 as Indicated by Incidence of Specified Adverse Events., Safety of afatinib as indicated by incidence of specified adverse events: skin reactions (a preferred term of the system organ class: Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders) and gastrointestinal (GI) (a system organ class)., First administration of trial medication until 28 days after last administration of trial medication, up to 93 months.|Safety of BIBW 2992 as Indicated by Intensity and Incidence of Worst Adverse Events Graded According to NCI CTCAE Version 3.0, Safety of afatinib as indicated by intensity and incidence of worst adverse events graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 (R04-0474)., First administration of trial medication until 28 days after last administration of trial medication, up to 93 months.",,Boehringer Ingelheim,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,129,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,1200.22,2007-08,2010-02,2015-08,2007-09-05,2013-10-14,2016-09-16,"1200.22.28 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Bakersfield, California, United States|1200.22.32 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Beverly Hills, California, United States|1200.22.4 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Mission Hills, California, United States|1200.22.16 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Orange, California, United States|1200.22.19 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States|1200.22.29 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, North Miami Beach, Florida, United States|1200.22.10 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Atlanta, Georgia, United States|1200.22.18 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Chicago, Illinois, United States|1200.22.3 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Bethesda, Maryland, United States|1200.22.14 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Boston, Massachusetts, United States|1200.22.24 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Flint, Michigan, United States|1200.22.5 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States|1200.22.15 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, New York, New York, United States|1200.22.26 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, New York, New York, United States|1200.22.1 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Rochester, New York, United States|1200.22.27 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Syracuse, New York, United States|1200.22.25 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Valhalla, New York, United States|1200.22.6 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Canton, Ohio, United States|1200.22.7 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, United States|1200.22.22 Boehringer Ingelheim Investigational Site, Mt.
