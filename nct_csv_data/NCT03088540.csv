NCT03088540,Study of REGN 2810 Compared to Platinum-Based Chemotherapies in Participants With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03088540,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The primary objectives of the study are:

* To compare the overall survival (OS) of cemiplimab versus standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapies in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumor cells
* To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of cemiplimab versus standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapies in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumor cells

The key secondary objective of the study is to compare the objective response rate (ORR) of cemiplimab versus platinum-based chemotherapies",NO,"Carcinoma，Non-Small-Cell Lung|Lung Carcinomas,

assessed by a blinded IRC using RECIST 1.1., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 68 months","Objective response rates (ORR), The number of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) divided by the number of patients in the efficacy analysis set, From date of randomization to the date of the first objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever comes first, up to 68 months|Best overall response (BOR), The BOR, as determined by the IRC per RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first, assessed up to 68 months|Compare the duration of response (DOR) of cemiplimab versus platinum based chemotherapies, Duration of response will be defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1) or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 68 months|Change from baseline in quality of life (QoL)
