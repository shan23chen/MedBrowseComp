This is compared to the total number of RBC units transfused during the 12-week interval from treatment weeks 13-24., Baseline: Day -83 to Day 1; Treatment: Weeks 13 to Week 24|Mean Change From Baseline In Liver Iron Concentration (LIC) At Week 48, Baseline was defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug was administered; if multiple values were present for the same date, the average of these values was used. If a participant had 1 postbaseline assessment, it was used as the Week 48 value. If a participant had multiple postbaseline assessments, the last one was used as the Week 48 value. The value of LIC was collected by magnetic resonance imaging. Participants with a LIC value \> 43 mg/g were not included in the analysis., Baseline: Week -12 to Day -1; Treatment: Week 48|Mean Change From Baseline In Mean Daily Dose Of Iron Chelation Therapies (ICT) At Week 48, Three different types of Iron Chelation Therapy (ICT) were analyzed: 1. Deferasirox 2. Deferiprone 3. Deferoxamine Mesilate/Deferoxamine The baseline mean daily dose was calculated using the ICT dosage during the 12 weeks prior to first study drug administration and the postbaseline mean daily dose was calculated during the last 12 weeks of the 48-week double-blind Treatment Period or the last 12 weeks of the study treatment for early discontinued participants., Baseline: Day -83 to Day 1; Treatment: Week 37 to Week 48|Mean Change From Baseline In Mean Serum Ferritin At Week 48, For each participant, the baseline mean serum ferritin level was calculated during the 12 weeks prior to first study drug administration. The postbaseline mean serum ferritin level was calculated during the last 12 weeks of the 48-week double-blind Treatment Period or last 12 weeks of study treatment, if discontinued early. The change was calculated as the difference of post baseline mean serum ferritin level and baseline mean serum ferritin level., Baseline: Day -83 to Day 1; Treatment: Week 37 to Week 48|Mean Change From Baseline In Total Hip And Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD) At Week 48, For BMD, the lumbar spine and total hip were measured at baseline and 48 weeks by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Baseline was defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug is administered; if multiple values are present for the same date, the average of these values was used. If during the 48 week double-blinded treatment period, a participant has only one assessment, it is counted as 'Week 48' visit; if a participant has multiple assessments, the last one is used as 'Week 48' visit. The analysis was done on the population that had at least 2 measurements., Baseline: Day 1; Treatment: Week 48|Mean Change From Baseline In Myocardial Iron At Week 48, Myocardial Iron levels were measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), using MRI parameter T2\* (Unit: ms). T2\* values correlates with heart failure (HF) risk (e.g. T2\*\<6ms: high HF risk)., Baseline: Day 1; Treatment: Week 48|Mean Change From Baseline in the Transfusion-dependent Quality of Life (TranQol) Questionnaire At Week 24, The TranQol is a self-administered quality of life tool developed for beta-thalassemia patients. The adult self-report version used in this study, includes 36 questions assessed on a 5-point response, that are grouped into 5 domains (Physical Health, Emotional Health, Sexual Health, Family Functioning, School/Career Functioning). Scores are calculated according to specific scoring algorithms developed by the authors. Both individual domains score and the total score range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Total Score and Physical Health domain score are reported. Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement., Baseline: 4 weeks prior to Day 1; Treatment: Week 24|Mean Change From Baseline in the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Questionnaire At Weeks 24, The SF-36 (version 2) is a generic, self-administered instrument consisting of 8 multi-item scales that assess 8 health domains. The raw score for each health domain is transformed into a 0 (worst) to 100 (best) domain score. The 0-100 scale score for each health domain is further converted to normbased scores using a T-score transformation, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher norm-based T-scores indicate better heath/QoL. The domains/summaries reported are: 1. Physical Functioning (Range of possible T-scores is 19.26 - 57.54) 2. General Health (Range of possible T-scores is 18.95 - 66.50) 3. Physical Component summary (PCS) (Range of possible T-scores is 5.02 - 79.78).
