NCT01938001,Rituximab Plus Lenalidomide for Patients With Relapsed / Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Follicular Lymphoma and Marginal Zone Lymphoma),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01938001,AUGMENT,COMPLETED,"This double-blind randomized, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide (Revlimid, CC-5013) in combination with rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. Patients will be randomized to receive either lenalidomide or placebo for twelve 28-day cycles in combination with rituximab. Anticipated time on study treatment is 1 year.",YES,"Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin",DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Placebo,"Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression Free Survival Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) According to the 2007 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from date of randomization into the study to the first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS was based on the data from the IRC review using the modified 2007 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC) using FDA censoring rules., From randomization of study drug up to disease progression or death, which occurred first; up to the data cut-off date of 22 June 2018; overall median follow-up time for all participants was 28.30 months (range: 0.1 to 51.3 months).","Durable Complete Response Rate (DCCR) as Assessed by the IRC According to the 2007 IWGRC, DCCR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best response of complete response (CR) that lasted no less than one year (≥ 48 weeks) during the study prior to administration of new anti-lymphoma therapy. A CR is defined as a complete disappearance of any disease-related symptoms and normalization of biochemical abnormalities., From first dose of investigational product (IP) to data cut-off date of 22 June 2018; the median treatment duration was 11.19 months in the rituximab/lenalidomiade arm and 11.04 months in the rituximab/placebo arm|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Overall survival was censored at the last date that the participant was known to be alive for participants who were alive at the time of analysis and for participants who were lost to follow-up before death was documented., From date of randomization to death due to any cause (Average of 55.71 months and a maximum up to 95.2 months)|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response as Assessed by the IRC According to the 2007 IWGRC, Percentage of participants with an objective response is defined as having a response of at least a PR during the study without administration of new anti-lymphoma therapy. A complete response = a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disappearance of any disease-related symptoms, and normalization of biochemical abnormalities; a partial response (PR) = 50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD., From date of first dose to data cut-off date of 22 June 2018; the median treatment duration was 11.19 months in the rituximab/lenalidomide arm and 11.04 months in the rituximab/placebo arm|Percentage of Participants With a Best Response of Complete Response as Assessed by the IRC According to the 2007 IWGRC, Percentage of participants with a best response of at CR during the study without administration of new anti-lymphoma therapy. A CR = Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disappearance of any disease-related symptoms, and normalization of biochemical abnormalities., From date of first dose up to data cut-off date of 22 June 2018; the median treatment duration was 11.19 months in the rituximab/lenalidomide arm and 11.04 months in the rituximab/placebo arm|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Duration of Objective Response as Assessed by the IRC According to the 2007 IWGRC, Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from initial response (at least PR) until documented progressive disease (PD) or death. Participants who had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the last assessment date that the participant was known to be progression free. Participants who received a new treatment without documented progression were censored at the last assessment date that the participants was known to be progression free., From randomization up to data cut-off date of 22 June 2018; overall median follow-up time for all participants was 28.30 months (range: 0.1 to 51.3 months).|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Duration of Complete Response (DOCR) as Assessed by the IRC According to the 2007 IWGRC, DOCR was defined as the time from initial CR until documented PD or death. Participants who had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the last assessment date that the participant was known to be progression free. Participants who received a new treatment without documented progression were censored at the last assessment date that the participants was known to be progression free., From randomization up to data cut-off date of 22 June 2018; overall median follow-up time for all participants was 28.30 months (range: 0.1 to 51.3 months).|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Event Free Survival as Assessed by the IRC According to the 2007 IWGRC, Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of first documented progression, relapse, institution of new anti-lymphoma treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy) or death from any cause. Responding participants and those who were lost to follow up were censored at their last tumor assessment date., From date of randomization to data cut-off date of 22 June 2018; overall median follow-up time for all participants was 28.30 months (range: 0.1 to 51.3 months).|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Time to Next Anti-Lymphoma Treatment (TTNLT), Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNLT) was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of first documented administration of a new anti-lymphoma treatment (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radioimmunotherapy or immunotherapy). The time to the next anti-lymphoma treatment was of special interest to the study., From date of randomization to date of first documented administration of a new anti-lymphoma treatment (Average of 55.71 months and a maximum up to 95.2 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs include AEs that started or worsened between the date of the first dose and 28 days after the date of the last dose. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any: • Death; • Life-threatening event; • Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity; • Congenital anomaly or birth defect; • Any other important medical event. The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.03) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death, From first dose to 28 days post last dose (Average of 55.71 months and a maximum up to 95.2 months)",,Celgene,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,358,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CC-5013-NHL-007,2013-11-21,2018-06-22,2022-01-26,2013-09-10,2019-08-13,2023-02-22,"Mitchell Cancer Center, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, 36604, United States|Arizona Center for Cancer Care, Glendale, Arizona, 85306, United States|Southwest Cancer Care Medical Group, Escondido, California, 92025, United States|Marin Oncology Associates, Greenbrae, California, 94904-2007, United States|Wilshire Oncology Medical Group, Inc, La Verne, California, 91750, United States|North County Hematology Oncology (NCHO) - TRM, LLC., Oceanside, California, 92056, United States|Hematology-Oncology Medical Group of Orange County, Inc., Orange, California, 92868, United States|UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Central Coast Medical Oncology Corporation, Santa Maria, California, 93454, United States|Wellness Hematology Oncology, West Hills, California, 92056, United States|Cancer Center of Central Connecticut, Southington, Connecticut, 06489, United States|Florida Cancer Specialists North Region Sarah Cannon Research, Saint Petersburg, Florida, 33705, United States|Illinois Cancer Care, P.C., Peoria, Illinois, 61615, United States|LRG Healthcare Oncology Clinic, Laconia, Indiana, 03246, United States|Iowa Oncology Research Association, Des Moines, Iowa, 50309, United States|University of Louisville, J.G.
