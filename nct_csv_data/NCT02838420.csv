NCT02838420,A Study to Evaluate and Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Alectinib Versus Crizotinib and to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Alectinib in Asian Participants With Treatment-Naive Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02838420,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized, multicenter, Phase III, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of alectinib versus crizotinib and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of alectinib in asian participants with treatment-naive ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. Participants will be randomized 2:1 into one of the two treatment groups to receive either alectinib (600 milligrams \[mg\] twice daily \[BID\]) or crizotinib (250 mg BID) orally, respectively.",YES,Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Alectinib|DRUG: Crizotinib,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v1.1, PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression, as determined by the investigators, or to death from any cause, whichever occurred first., From the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to overall period of approximately 40 months)","PFS as Determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) Using RECIST v1.1, PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression, as determined by an independent review committee, or to death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study and 4 weeks after permanent discontinuation (up to overall period of approximately 40 months)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as Determined by Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study and 4 weeks after permanent discontinuation (up to overall period of approximately 40 months)|Time to Progression of Disease in the CNS as Determined by IRC Using RECIST v1.1, Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study and 4 weeks after permanent discontinuation (up to overall period of approximately 40 months)|Time to Progression of Disease in the CNS as Determined by IRC Using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO), Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study and 4 weeks after permanent discontinuation (up to overall period of approximately 40 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) Assessed by Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study and 4 weeks after permanent discontinuation (up to overall period of approximately 40 months)|Overall Survival Time, Baseline, until death (up to overall period of approximately 40 months)|Percentage of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product.
