NCT02853305,Study of Pembrolizumab With or Without Platinum-based Combination Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Urothelial Carcinoma (MK-3475-361/KEYNOTE-361),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02853305,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (pembro, MK-3475) with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in participants with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer).

The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in all participants, and that pembrolizumab alone is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to OS in all participants and in participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors (Combined Positive Score \[CPS\] ≥10%).",YES,"Urothelial Carcinoma Associated 1 RNA, Human",BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine,"Pembro Combo vs Chemo: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The sponsor allowed a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ on this study.

Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the chemo arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population (all randomized participants).
