NCT01143402,Temozolomide or Selumetinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma of the Eye,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01143402,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase II trial studies temozolomide to see how well it works compared to selumetinib in treating patients with melanoma of the eye that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is more effective than selumetinib in treating melanoma of the eye.",YES,Iris Melanoma|Medium/Large Size Posterior Uveal Melanoma|Ocular Melanoma With Extraocular Extension|Recurrent Uveal Melanoma|Small Size Posterior Uveal Melanoma|Stage IV Uveal Melanoma,DRUG: Dacarbazine|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|DRUG: Selumetinib|DRUG: Temozolomide,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Evaluable Randomized Patients), The primary analysis will be performed among the Gnaq/Gna11 mutant patients. A stratified logrank test will be performed stratified by mutation status, M stage, and number of prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. Due to the potential for a large number of strata and small strata sizes, the standard asymptotic stratified logrank test will be verified for robustness utilizing a permutation reference distribution., The time from randomization to the earlier date of objective disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria or death due to any cause in the absence of progression, assessed up to 5 years","Median Overall Survival (Evaluable Randomized Patients), The primary analysis will be performed among the Gnaq/Gna11 mutant patients.
