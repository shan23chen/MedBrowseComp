Participants who maintain RBC-TI through the end of the Treatment Period or time of analysis will be censored at EOT visit date, subsequent MDS therapy start date, study discontinuation date, analysis cutoff date or death, whichever occurs first. Median is from un-stratified Kaplan-Meier method., Week 1 through End of Treatment (Up to approximately an average of 66 weeks and a maximum of 202 weeks)|The Number of Red Blood Cell (RBC) Units Transfused Within the First 24 Weeks of Treatment, RBC transfusion burden on treatment is defined as total number of packed red blood cell (pRBC) units transfused within the first 24 weeks of treatment since Week 1., Week 1 through Week 24|Percentage of Participants Achieving Red Blood Cell Transfusion Independence (RBC-TI) for ≥ 56 Days (8 Weeks), Defined as percentage of participants achieving RBC-TI for \>= 56 days during any consecutive 56-day period from Week 1 through Week 24., Week 1 through Week 24|Percentage of Participants Achieving Red Blood Cell Transfusion Independence (RBC-TI) for a Consecutive 24-week Period, Defined as percentage of participants achieving RBC-TI for \>= 168 days during any consecutive 168-day period from Week 1 through Week 48., Week 1 through Week 48|The Number of Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Progression, Progression to AML is defined as a diagnosis of AML as per WHO classification of ≥ 20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow., From randomization to 5 years from first dose or 3 years from last dose (whichever occurs later), unless the participant withdraws consent from the study, dies or is lost to follow-up. (Up to approximately 221 weeks)|Median Time to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Progression, Time to AML progression is defined as the time between randomization and first diagnosis of AML as per WHO classification of ≥ 20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow. Participants with diagnosis of AML will be considered to have had an event. Participants who have not progressed to AML at the time of analysis will be censored at the last assessment date which does not indicate progression to AML estimated by Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to first diagnosis of AML up to 5 years from first dose or 3 years from last dose (whichever occurs later), unless the participant withdraws consent from the study, dies or is lost to follow-up.

The severity/intensity of AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0). Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening, and Grade 5 = Death., From first dose to 42 days post last dose (Up to approximately an average of 72 weeks and a maximum of 208 weeks)|Number of Participants With a Positive Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Test, Number of participants under each ADA positive category. A participant is counted as 'Treatment-Emergent' if there is a positive post-baseline sample while the baseline sample is ADA negative, or there is a positive post-baseline sample with a titer \>= 4-fold of the baseline titer while the baseline sample is ADA positive. A participant is counted as 'Preexisting' if the baseline sample is ADA positive and the participant is not qualified for 'Treatment-Emergent'. If the participant was discontinued from study treatment earlier than one year from the first dose, additional samples will be collected if last ADA is positive.

Baseline is defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug., Day 1 on week 4, 10, 16, 22, and every 12 weeks (±14 days) from the 24-Week MDS Assessment visit for up to one year from the first dose|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of 30 items that includes a global health status score ranging from: 1-7 as well as scores for 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain) and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) all ranging from 1-4. Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A high score for a functional scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning; a high score for the global health status/health related quality of life (HRQoL) represents a high overall HRQoL; but a high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. Baseline is defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug., Baseline and week 24.|Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia Version 4 (FACT-An), The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire includes 47 items rating on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) (so that 0 is considered worse quality of life and 4 is good response) on five primary subscales:

* Physical well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Social/Family well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Emotional well-being (sum of 6 items, score range from 0-24)
* Functional well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Anemia-related symptoms (sum of 20 items, score range from 0-80)

A total score for the FACT-An can be calculated by summing the five primary subscales with a score range from 0-188. Higher scores representing better quality of life.
