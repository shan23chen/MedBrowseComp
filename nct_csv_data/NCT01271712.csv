NCT01271712,Study of Regorafenib as a 3rd-line or Beyond Treatment for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01271712,GRID,COMPLETED,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study of regorafenib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care for subjects with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) whose disease has progressed despite prior treatment with at least imatinib and sunitinib.

The study is composed of 3 periods: A Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a Survival Follow up Period.

Subjects randomized to be treated with regorafenib will receive 160 mg po od for 3 weeks of every 4 week (28 day) cycle (ie, 3 weeks on/1 week off). In addition subjects will receive best supportive care which excludes any disease specific anti cancer therapy such as any kinase inhibitor, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.

Tumor assessment will be every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, every 6 weeks for the next 3 months (through month 6), and every 8 weeks until the end of treatment, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Tumor assessments include CT or MRI and will be performed until tumor progression is seen in a central radiology review.

Subjects receiving placebo who experience disease progression may be offered active treatment.

Subjects who experience progression during regorafenib treatment may continue open label treatment.

All subjects will enter the Survival Follow-up Period upon discontinuation of randomized study treatment.",YES,Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors,"DRUG: Regorafenib (Stivarga, BAY73-4506)|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Best supportive care","Progression-free Survival, Progression-free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to radiological disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS was based on central radiological assessment using modified RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) v.1.1. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study; or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; or appearance of new lesions. Subjects without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation. Results are based on central evaluation., From randomization of the first subject until approximately 144 progression-free survival events had occurred (study duration approximately one year)","Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their date of last contact. Median OS was not observed at the time of PFS analysis and first analysis of OS, therefore only the proportion of death events was reported in the results posting system. This approach was maintained for the subsequent updates in the results posting system., From randomization of the first subject until date of database cutoff (08 Jun 2015)|Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the time from date of randomization to disease progression (based on central radiological assessment using modified RECIST \[Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\] v.1.1). Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study; or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; or appearance of new lesions. Subjects without progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation. Results are based on central evaluation., From randomization of the first subject until until date of database cutoff (26 Jan 2012); study duration approximately 1 year|Tumor Response, Tumor Response of a subject was defined as the best tumor response (Complete Response \[CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target).\], Partial Response \[PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.\], Stable Disease \[SD: steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.\], or Progressive Disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions.\]) observed during the trial period and assessed according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Results are based on central evaluation., From randomization of the first subject until date of database cutoff (26 Jan 2012); study duration approximately 1 year|Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target).) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Results are based on central evaluation., From randomization of the first subject until date of database cutoff (26 Jan 2012); study duration approximately 1 year.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target).), Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.), or Stable Disease (SD: steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. SD had to be maintained for at least 12 weeks from the first demonstration of that rating. Results are based on central evaluation., From randomization of the first subject until date of database cutoff (26 Jan 2012); study duration approximately 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response was defined as the time from date of first response (Complete Response \[CR: disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and non-target).\] or Partial Response \[PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.\]) to the date when Progressive Disease (PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions.) is first documented, or to the date of death, whichever occurs first, according to RECIST v1.1. Subjects still having CR or PR and have not died at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation. Duration of response defined for responders only, i.e CR or PR.
