NCT00408408,"Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00408408,,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of breast cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving chemotherapy and bevacizumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving bevacizumab after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying six different chemotherapy regimens to compare how well they work with or without bevacizumab in treating women with stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.",YES,Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: bevacizumab|DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin)|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride,"Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) of the Primary Tumor in the Breast, Percentage of patients absent of histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen., Time of surgery, on average 6 or 13 months","pCR in the Breast and Nodes, Percentage of patients absent of histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and axillary lymph nodes., Time of surgery, on average 6 or 13 months|Clinical Overall Response (cOR) Following Docetaxel Alone, Docetaxel/Capecitabine, and Docetaxel/Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, With or Without Bevacizumab, as Assessed by Physical Exam at the Completion of the Docetaxel-based Portion of Chemotherapy, Percentages of patients assessed as Clinical Complete Response or Clinical Partial Response according to RECIST., Assessed at cycle 5 of chemotherapy, on average at 15 weeks|Clinical Overall Response: cOR as Assessed by Physical Exam at the Completion of the Sequential Chemotherapy Regimens, The percentage of patients assessed by physical exam as Clinical Complete Response or Clinical Partial Response according to RECIST., Three to four weeks after the last chemotherapy dose on average 6 or 13 months|Clinical Complete Response (cCR) Following Docetaxel Alone, Docetaxel/Capecitabine, and Docetaxel/Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, With or Without Bevacizumab, as Assessed by Physical Exam at Completion of Therapy, Percentages of patients assessed as Clinical Complete Response or Clinical Partial Response according to RECIST., Assessed at cycle 5 of chemotherapy, on average at 15 weeks|Clinical Complete Resonse: cCR as Assessed by Physical Exam at the Completion of the Sequential Chemotherapy Regimens, The percentage of patients assessed by physical exam as Clinical Complete Response according to RECIST., Three to four weeks after the last chemotherapy dose, on average at 6 or 13 months|Percentage of Cardiac Events, After each cycle, 3-5 weeks postoperative, 9 and 12 months from study entry, every 6 month years 2-5, and annually years 6-10, for postoperative bevacizumab patients, every 6 weeks during postoperative therapy and at 18 months following study entry.|Surgical Complication, Number of patients with Grade 4 or above surgery-related toxicities, 24 months after study entry|Toxicities Including Events Other Than Congestive Heart Failure, of Chemotherapy Alone, Bevacizumab With Chemotherapy, and Bevacizumab Alone, The number of patients who experienced Grade 1 or above Adverse Events.
