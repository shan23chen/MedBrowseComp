NCT02101775,"Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With or Without WEE1 Inhibitor MK-1775 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02101775,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase II clinical trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 work compared to gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of time. Gemcitabine hydrochloride may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, molecules that contain instructions for the proper development and functioning of cells), which in turn stops the tumor from growing. The protein WEE1 may help to repair the damaged tumor cells, so the tumor continues to grow. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may block the WEE1 protein activity and may increase the effectiveness of gemcitabine hydrochloride by preventing the WEE1 protein from repairing damaged tumor cells without causing harm to normal cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may be an effective treatment for recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.",YES,Ovarian Brenner Tumor|Ovarian Carcinosarcoma|Ovarian Clear Cell Cystadenocarcinoma|Ovarian Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma|Ovarian Mucinous Cystadenocarcinoma|Ovarian Seromucinous Carcinoma|Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma|Ovarian Serous Surface Papillary Adenocarcinoma|Ovarian Undifferentiated Carcinoma|Recurrent Fallopian Tube Carcinoma|Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma|Recurrent Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma,DRUG: Adavosertib|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Pharmacological Study|OTHER: Placebo Administration|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration,"Progression Free Survival, To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer receiving gemcitabine in combination with AZD1775 compared to subjects receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo. Progression is defined, using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) guideline, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From start of treatment until date of progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to 1 year follow-up","Objective Response, To evaluate the objective response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD1775 compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo. RECIST v1.1 criteria used for evaluation of target lesions: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. The Best Overall Response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence ., From start of treatment, every 6-8 weeks, until time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to 1 year follow-up|Response According to CA125 Criteria, To evaluate the GCIG CA125 response rate of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD1775 compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo. A response according to CA-125 has occurred if there is at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pre-treatment sample. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days., From start of treatment, every 4 weeks, until time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to 1 year follow-up|Overall Survival, To evaluate the overall survival of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD1775 compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo., From start of study treatment, every 12 weeks, until death, up to 22 months follow-up|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events Related to Study Treatment, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of gemcitabine combined with AZD1775 in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer., From start of treatment until AE resolution, stabilization, or improvement to less than grade 2, up to 1 year follow-up|TP53 Mutations, To evaluate TP53 mutations (presence of mutation and type of mutation) as potential predictive factors of benefit (defined as response or PFS prolongation) to AZD1775 and gemcitabine treatment. TP53 status was assessed using Sanger sequencing., Baseline|p53 Protein Expression, To evaluate p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry as potential predictive factors of benefit (defined as response or PFS prolongation) to AZD1775 and gemcitabine treatment.

Evaluating p53 expression in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer and in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer with TP53 mutations., Baseline","Patient Reported Outcomes, Will be assessed using Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

Each symptomatic AE is assessed with respect to 1 to 3 of the following attributes: frequency (F), severity (S) and/or interference (I) with usual or daily activities, and a recall period of 'the past 7 days'. PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 to 4 with scores of 3 and 4 corresponding to high frequency, severity and/or interference. Results show the number of patients in each arm reporting high scores (3-4) for symptomatic AEs occurring in \>30% of patients, First 3 months|TP53 Mutations in Circulating Tumor Deoxyribonucleic Acid, TP53 mutations in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid will be evaluated by TAm-Seq., Baseline|Change in Levels of Circulating Deoxyribonucleic Acid TP53 Mutations by TAm-Seq, Levels of circulating deoxyribonucleic acid TP53 mutations will be correlated with response.
