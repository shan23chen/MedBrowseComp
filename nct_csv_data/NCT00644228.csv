NCT00644228,Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone With or Without Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00644228,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and bortezomib to see how well it works compared to dexamethasone and lenalidomide alone in treating patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide and dexamethasone is more effective with or without bortezomib in treating multiple myeloma.",YES,DS Stage I Multiple Myeloma|DS Stage II Multiple Myeloma|DS Stage III Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Lenalidomide,"Progression-free Survival, Unstratified median progression-free survival in months., From date of registration to date of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration, or death due to any cause, assessed up to 6 years","Overall Survival, Unstratified median overall survival in months., Up to 6 years|Response Rates (), The response rate was calculated as the number of patients with documented confirmed partial response (PR) or better, which includes confirmed/unconfirmed stringent complete response (sCR), confirmed/unconfirmed complete response (CR), confirmed/unconfirmed very good partial response (VGPR), or confirmed partial response (PR), as best response divided by the total number of evaluable patients, in each arm. Patients with measurable disease, as defined in the protocol, are evaluable. Response rates were compared between the two treatment arms using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Response designations were based on the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma.
