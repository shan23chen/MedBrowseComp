NCT02576977,Study of Pomalidomide and Low Dose Dexamethasone With or Without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Refractory or Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma (rrMM) (MK-3475-183/KEYNOTE-183),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02576977,,TERMINATED,The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) to that of pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone without pembrolizumab in terms of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in participants with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM) who have undergone at least 2 lines of prior treatment. The study's 2 primary hypotheses are: 1. Pembrolizumab in combination with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone prolongs PFS as assessed by Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) blinded central review using International Myeloma Working Group Criteria for Response Assessment in Multiple Myeloma (IMWG) criteria compared to treatment with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone standard of care (SOC) alone. 2. Pembrolizumab in combination with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone prolongs OS compared to treatment with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (SOC) alone.,YES,Multiple Myeloma,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Assessed by Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) Blinded Central Review According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria, Progression free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS was assessed by CAC blinded central review according to the IMWG criteria based on the development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or on a definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. Median PFS was calculated from the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The database cutoff date was July 9, 2018., Up to approximately 30 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. Median overall survival was calculated from the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The database cutoff date was August 3, 2020., Up to approximately 54 months","Overall Response Rate (ORR) Evaluated According to the IMWG Response Criteria by CAC Blinded Central Review, ORR was defined as the percentage of the participants in the analysis population who achieved at least a partial response (stringent complete response \[sCR\]+complete response \[CR\]+very good partial response \[VGPR\]+partial response \[PR\]) according to the IMWG. CR = negative immunofixation of serum and urine AND disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas AND \<5% plasmacytomas in the bone marrow; sCR=stringent complete response, CR as above PLUS normal serum free light-chain (FLC) assay ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence; VGPR = serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis OR ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-component plus urine M-component \<100 mg/24 hr; PR = ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours. The database cutoff date was July 9, 2018., Up to approximately 30 months|Participants Experiencing One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it was considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurred during the course of the study. Database cutoff was August 3, 2020., Up to approximately 54 months|Participants Discontinuing Study Investigational Product Due to an AE, An adverse event was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it was considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurred during the course of the study. Database cutoff was August 3, 2020., Up to approximately 54 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Evaluated According to the IMWG Response Criteria by CAC Blinded Central Review, Disease control rate was the percentage of participants who achieved confirmed sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, minimal response (MR) or have demonstrated stable disease (SD) for at least 12 weeks prior to any evidence of progression. PD was development of or an increase in the size of bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. CR = negative immunofixation of serum and urine AND disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas AND \<5% plasmacytomas in the bone marrow; sCR=stringent complete response, CR as above PLUS normal serum FLC assay ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry/fluorescence; VGPR = serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis OR ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-component plus urine M-component \<100 mg/24 hr; PR = ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours. The data cutoff date was July 9, 2018., Up to approximately 30 months|Second Progression Free Survival (PFS2), PFS2 was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease progression after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, by investigator assessment. As a result of a full clinical hold by FDA that led to discontinuation of study enrollment, no data was collected for analysis of PFS2., Up to approximately 30 months",,Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,251,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,3475-183|2015-002509-13|163146|MK-3475-183|KEYNOTE-183,2015-10-19,2018-07-09,2020-07-16,2015-10-15,2019-08-02,2021-10-08,,"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/77/NCT02576977/Prot_SAP_001.pdf"
