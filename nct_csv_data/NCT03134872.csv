NCT03134872,A Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With Pemetrexed and Carboplatin in Subjects With Non-squamous NSCLC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03134872,,COMPLETED,"SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody. This is a randomized,Phase III, multicenter ,open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 with carboplatin and pemetrexed versus carboplatin-pemetrexed in subjects who are chemotherapy naive and have Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC.

The primary hypothesis is that SHR-1210 combined with carboplatin and pemetrexed prolongs Progression Free Survival (PFS) in per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (ITT population and population was indicated by high PD-L1 expression) compared to carboplatin and pemetrexed treatment .",NO,"Lung Neoplasms|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Respiratory Tract Neoplasms|Thoracic Neoplasms|Lung Diseases|Respiratory Tract Disease|Neoplasms by Site|Neoplasm, Bronchial|Carcinoma, Bronchogenic",BIOLOGICAL: SHR-1210|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed,"Progression-Free Survival in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.
