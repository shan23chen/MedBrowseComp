NCT00942331,Gemcitabine Hydrochloride and Cisplatin With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Advanced Urinary Tract Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00942331,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial studies gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin in treating patients with urinary tract cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with bevacizumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin are more effective when given with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with urinary tract cancer.",YES,Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma|Metastatic Renal Pelvis Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Ureter Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Urethral Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma|Stage IV Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma AJCC v7|Stage IV Prostate Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IV Renal Pelvis Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IV Ureter Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IV Urethral Cancer AJCC v7|Unresectable Urothelial Carcinoma,BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Placebo Administration,"Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival time is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The median and 95% confidence intervals are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.The stratified log-rank statistic will be the primary analysis to compare the two treatment arms on OS with the stratification factors: presence of visceral metastases (no, yes) and prior chemotherapy (no, yes). In addition, the proportional hazards model will be used to assess the importance of the treatment arm adjusting on patient characteristics, stratification variables and other important covariates in predicting OS., From date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 7 years","Progression-free Survival (PFS), The primary analysis of PFS will be a two-sided stratified log-rank test comparing arm A and arm B. The stratification factors will consist of the two stratification factors used for patient randomization: prior nephrectomy (yes vs. no) and Motzer score (0 vs. 1-2 vs. 3+). Results from unstratified log-rank tests will also be provided. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm., From the date of randomization to date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 7 years|Objective Response, Objective response is defined as confirmed complete and partial responses using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. A complete response (CR) is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions. A partial response (PR) is defined as having at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum.

In each arm, the number of patients reporting a CR or PR was divided by the number of patients evaluable in each arm to obtain the proportion., Up to 7 years|Number of Patients Experiencing Grade 3+ Toxicity, The number of patients experiencing grade 3 or higher toxicity (adverse events considered at least possibly related to treatment) is reported below., Up to 7 years",,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,506,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",NCI-2011-01952|NCI-2011-01952|CDR0000649174|CALGB-90601|CALGB-90601|U10CA180821|U10CA031946,2009-07-15,2018-11-02,2021-06-15,2009-07-20,2020-02-17,2023-10-16,"University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|Providence Hospital, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, Fairbanks, Alaska, 99701, United States|University of Arizona Cancer Center-Orange Grove Campus, Tucson, Arizona, 85704, United States|Banner University Medical Center -
