NCT00005863,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Filgrastim and/or Tretinoin in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00005863,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy with filgrastim and/or tretinoin is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone for acute myeloid leukemia.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy with filgrastim and/or tretinoin to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",NO,Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms,BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: daunorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: tretinoin,,,,Medical Research Council,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000067895|MRC-LEUK-AML-HR|EU-20008,1998-08,,2004-12,2003-01-27,,2013-12-19,"Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, England, B9 5SS, United Kingdom",
