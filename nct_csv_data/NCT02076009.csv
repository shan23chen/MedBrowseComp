NCT02076009,"A Study Comparing Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02076009,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of daratumumab when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) to that of lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), in terms of progression-free survival in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.",YES,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS: duration from date of randomization to either progressive disease (PD)/death, whichever occurred first. PD: defined as meeting any 1 of following criteria: Increase of greater than equal to (\>=)25 percent(%) in level of serum M-protein from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>=0.5 gram per deciliter (g/dL); Increase of \>=25% in 24-hours(h) urinary light chain excretion (urine M-protein) from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>=200 mg/24h; Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: increase of \>=25% in difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>10 mg/dL; Definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) attributed solely to plasma cell (PC) proliferative disorder., From randomization to either disease progression or death whichever occurs first (up to 21 months)","Time to Disease Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as time from date of randomization to date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD). PD was defined as meeting any one of following criteria: Increase of \>=25% in level of serum M-protein from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>=0.5 g/dL; Increase of \>=25% in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion (urine M-protein) from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>=200 mg/24hours; Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: increase of \>=25% in difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>10 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL); Definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to plasma cell (PC) proliferative disorder., From randomization to disease progression (up to 21 months)|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better, VGPR or better is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved VGPR, complete response (CR) and stringent complete response (sCR) according to the International Myeloma Working Group criteria (IMWG). IMWG criteria for VGPR: Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or \>=90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein \<100 mg/24 hours, if the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>90% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria. In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, a \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required; CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \<5% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR and normal FLC ratio, absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or 2- to 4 color flow cytometry., From randomization to disease progression (up to 21 months)|Percentage of Participants With Negative Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Minimal residual disease was assessed for all participants who achieved a complete response (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR). CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \<5% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR and normal FLC ratio, absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or 2- to 4 color flow cytometry. The MRD negativity rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had negative MRD assessment at any time point after the first dose of study drugs by evaluation of bone marrow aspirates or whole blood at 10\^ minus (-) 4, 10\^-5, 10\^-6 threshold., From randomization to the date of first documented evidence of PD (up to 87.5 months)|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a partial response (PR) or better according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, during or after study treatment. IMWG criteria for PR: \>=50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours, if the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria, in addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, a \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., From randomization to disease progression (up to 21 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death., From randomization to date of death due to any cause (up to 87.5 months)|Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first efficacy evaluation that the participant met all criteria for partial response (PR) or better., From randomization up to first documented CR or PR (up to 21 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined for participants with confirmed response (PR or better) as time between first documentation of response and disease progression/death due to PD, whichever occurs first. PD was defined as meeting any one of following criteria: Increase of \>=25% in level of serum M-protein from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>=0.5g/dL; Increase of \>=25% in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion (urine M-protein) from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>=200mg/24hours; Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: increase of \>=25% in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>10mg/dL; Definite increase in size of existing bone lesions/soft tissue plasmacytomas; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to PC proliferative disorder., From randomization to the date of first documented evidence of PD (up to 21 months)|Time to Subsequent Anticancer Treatment, Time to subsequent anticancer treatment was defined as the time from randomization to the start of subsequent anticancer treatment or death due to progressive disease (PD), whichever occurs first., From randomization to date of start of subsequent anticancer treatment or death due to PD, whichever occured first (up to 87.5 months)",,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,569,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CR103663|54767414MMY3003|2013-005525-23,2014-07-23,2016-03-07,2023-09-20,2014-03-03,2017-02-10,2025-04-01,"Little Rock, Arkansas, United States|Gainesville, Florida, United States|West Palm Beach, Florida, United States|Atlanta, Georgia, United States|Chicago, Illinois, United States|Iowa City, Iowa, United States|Louisville, Kentucky, United States|Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States|New Orleans, Louisiana, United States|Bethesda, Maryland, United States|Columbia, Maryland, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, United States|Rochester, Minnesota, United States|Omaha, Nebraska, United States|New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States|New York, New York, United States|Charlotte, North Carolina, United States|Eugene, Oregon, United States|Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States|Austin, Texas, United States|Dallas, Texas, United States|Houston, Texas, United States|Fairfax, Virginia, United States|Camperdown, Australia|Geelong, Australia|Heidelberg, Australia|Malvern, Australia|South Brisbane, Australia|Southport, Australia|Anderlecht, Belgium|Antwerpen, Belgium|Edegem, Belgium|Gent, Belgium|Kortrijk, Belgium|Leuven, Belgium|Liege, Belgium|Calgary, Alberta, Canada|Edmonton, Alberta, Canada|Surrey, British Columbia, Canada|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada|Hamilton, Ontario, Canada|London, Ontario, Canada|Toronto, Ontario, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, Canada|Quebec City, Quebec, Canada|Copenhagen, Denmark|Odense, Denmark|Vejle, Denmark|Argenteuil, France|Caen, France|Lille, France|Limoges, France|Nantes Cedex 1, France|Paris, France|Pessac, France|Pierre Benite, France|Rennes, France|Toulouse Cedex 9, France|Tours Cedex 9, France|Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France|Berlin, Germany|Bonn, Germany|Hamburg, Germany|Hamm, Germany|Heidelberg, Germany|Jena, Germany|Karlsruhe, Germany|Koblenz, Germany|Köln, Germany|Saarbrücken, Germany|Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany|Athens Attica, Greece|Haifa, Israel|Jerusalem, Israel|Nahariya, Israel|Netanya, Israel|Petah Tikva, Israel|Ramat Gan, Israel|Tel Aviv, Israel|Hitachi, Japan|Kanazawa, Japan|Kobe, Japan|Kurume, Japan|Matsuyama, Japan|Nagoya, Japan|Narita, Japan|Ohgaki, Japan|Okayama, Japan|Osaka, Japan|Sendai-City, Japan|Shibukawa, Japan|Shibuya, Japan|Tachikawa, Japan|Tokyo, Japan|Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of|Incheon, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, Korea, Republic of|Amsterdam, Netherlands|Rotterdam, Netherlands|Utrecht, Netherlands|Zwolle, Netherlands|Brzozow, Poland|Chorzow, Poland|Gdansk, Poland|Legnica, Poland|Lublin, Poland|Poznan, Poland|Slupsk, Poland|Wroclawa, Poland|Dzerzhinsk, Russian Federation|Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation|Moscow, Russian Federation|Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation|Petrozavodsk, Russian Federation|Ryazan, Russian Federation|Samara, Russian Federation|St-Petersburg, Russian Federation|St. Petersburg, Russian Federation|Syktyvkar, Russian Federation|Badalona, Spain|Barcelona, Spain|La Laguna (Santa Cruz De Tenerife), Spain|Madrid, Spain|Pamplona, Spain|Salamanca, Spain|Sevilla, Spain|Falun, Sweden|Göteborg, Sweden|Helsingborg, Sweden|Huddinge, Sweden|Lund, Sweden|Stockholm, Sweden|Uppsala, Sweden|Changhua, Taiwan|Taichung City, Taiwan|Tainan, Taiwan|Taipei, Taiwan|Taoyuan, Taiwan|Birmingham, United Kingdom|Leeds, United Kingdom|London, United Kingdom|Oxford, United Kingdom|Southampton, United Kingdom|Surrey, United Kingdom|Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",
