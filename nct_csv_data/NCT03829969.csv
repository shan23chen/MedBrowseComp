NCT03829969,Toripalimab or Placebo With Paclitaxel and Cisplatin in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03829969,JUPITER06,COMPLETED,"This is one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled phase III study. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of JS001 combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin(TP regimen )with placebo combined with TP regimen in patients with advanced or metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma(ESCC )who have not received systemic chemotherapy previously.",YES,Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer Without Previous Systemic Chemotherapy,BIOLOGICAL: Toripalimab,"PFS((Progression-Free Surviv), To evaluate the differences in PFS following JS001 in combination with TP regimen compared to placebo in combination with TP regimen in all randomized patient population with advanced or metastatic ESCC who had not previously received systemic chemotherapy (as assessed by blinded independent central review \[BICR\] per RECIST 1.1 criteria)., PFS: up to 2years|OS (Overall Survival), To evaluate the differences in OS following JS001 in combination with TP regimen compared to placebo in combination with TP regimen in all randomized patient population with advanced or metastatic ESCC who had not previously received systemic chemotherapy (as assessed by blinded independent central review \[BICR\] per RECIST 1.1 criteria), up to 2 years","ORR(Overall Response Rate:BICR), To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by blind independent review committee BIRC and investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR), daccording to RECIST v1.1; ORR:Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 2 approximately years|DCR(Disease Control Rate:BICR ), To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by blind independent review committee BIRC and investigator-assessed disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST v1.1 DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with the best efficacy of CR or PR or SD., Up to 2 approximately years|DOR(Duration of Response: Recist 1.1,BICR ), To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by blind independent review committee BIRC and investigator-assessed duration of response (DoR) according to RECIST v1.1 DOR is defined as the time from first documented response to first documented evidence of disease progression or to death, whichever comes first., Up to 2 approximately years|TTR(Time to Initial Response:BICR ), To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, as measured by blind independent review committee BIRC and investigator-assessed Time to initial Response (TTR) according to RECIST v1.1 TTR is defined as the time from randomization to the first recorded response (CR or PR)., Up to 2 approximately years|PFS, To evaluate the efficacy of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapyï¼Œas measured by investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 approximately years|PFS Rate:BICR, 1 years PFS rate, Up to 1 years|OS Rate, 2 years OS rate, up to 2 years|PFS Assessed Per irRECIST, To evaluate PFS of JS001 plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy according to irRECIST, From date of randomization, until disease progression , loss of clinical benefit ,withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.
