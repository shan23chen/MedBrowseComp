NCT01228734,"A Trial to Compare Oxaliplatin, Folinic Acid (FA) and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) Combination Chemotherapy (FOLFOX-4) With or Without Cetuximab in the 1st Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) in Chinese Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (RAS) Wild-type Patients",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01228734,TAILOR,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study was to assess whether the progression free survival (PFS) time with FOLFOX-4 plus cetuximab is longer than that with FOLFOX-4 alone as first-line treatment for mCRC in Chinese subjects with RAS wild-type tumors.,YES,Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Folinic Acid|DRUG: 5Fluorouracil,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS was defined as the duration (in months) from randomization until the first progressive disease (PD) observation as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, or death due to any cause when death occurred within 90 days of randomization or the last tumor assessment, whichever was later. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions, taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started (including baseline), or appearance of one or more new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Baseline up to 333 weeks","Overall Survival (OS) Time, OS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to death. For subjects who were still alive at the analysis data cut-off date or who lost to follow-up, survival was censored at the last recorded date that the subject was known to be alive., Baseline up to 333 weeks|Best Overall Response Rate (ORR), The Best ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.0 as determined by the IRC. CR: defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR: defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions., Baseline up to 333 weeks|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF was defined as time from randomization to date of the first occurrence of radiologically confirmed PD as determined by IRC, Clinical PD according to the Investigator's assessment (if radiological confirmation of PD by IRC was unavailable), discontinuation of treatment due to progression or adverse event, start of new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death within 90 days of last tumor assessment or randomization. Subjects without event were censored on the date of last tumor assessment., Baseline up to 333 weeks|Number of Subjects With Curative Surgery of Liver Metastases, The number of subjects who underwent liver metastatic surgery after start of treatment and the outcome of surgery with respect to residual tumor after surgery (R0, R1, R2, not evaluable) were summarized. In case of resection of more than one metastasis, the worst outcome of surgery defined the overall status of a subject. R0 = No residual tumor after resection (all lesions resected completely); R1 = Metastases not resected completely with microscopic residual lesions; and R2 = Metastases not resected completely with macroscopic residual lesions., Baseline up to 333 weeks",,"Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,553,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EMR62202-057,2010-09-09,2016-01-25,2018-01-31,2010-10-26,2017-03-06,2020-01-28,"Fujian Province Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350014, China|Fuzhou General Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350025, China|First Hospital Affiliated to Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510405, China|Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China|The Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150040, China|Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430023, China|Jilin Cancer Hospital, Changchun, Jilin, 130012, China|First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China|The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310009, China|Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310016, China|307 Hospital of PLA, Beijing, 100071, China|The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, 100853, China|Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, 233004, China|The Xiangya 2nd Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China|Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, 400038, China|Yunnan Provincial Tumor Hospital, KunMing, Yunnan, 650118, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330006, China|Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China|Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, 200032, China|Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200080, China|Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Shuzhou, Jiangsu, 215006, China|Tianjin People's Hospital, Tianjin, 30000, China|Xijing Hospital the 4th Military Medical University of PLA, Xi'an, 710032, China",
