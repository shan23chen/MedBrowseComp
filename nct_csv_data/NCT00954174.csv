NCT00954174,"Paclitaxel and Carboplatin or Ifosfamide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Persistent or Recurrent Uterine, Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cavity Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00954174,,UNKNOWN,"This randomized phase III trial studies paclitaxel and carboplatin see how well they work compared with paclitaxel and ifosfamide in treating patients with fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer that is newly diagnosed, persistent, or has come back (recurrent). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, and ifosfamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective when given with carboplatin or ifosfamide in treating patients with uterine, ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cavity cancer.",YES,Mixed Mesodermal (Mullerian) Tumor|Ovarian Carcinosarcoma|Recurrent Fallopian Tube Carcinoma|Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma|Recurrent Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma|Stage I Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IA Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IA Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IA Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IB Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IB Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IB Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IC Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IC Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IC Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage II Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIA Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIA Ovarian Cancer AJCC V6 and v7|Stage IIA Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IIB Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIB Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIB Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IIC Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIC Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIIA Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIA Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIIA Primary Peritoneal Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIA Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IIIB Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIB Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIIB Primary Peritoneal Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIB Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IIIC Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIC Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIIC Primary Peritoneal Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIC Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IV Fallopian Tube Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IV Ovarian Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IV Primary Peritoneal Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IVA Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Stage IVB Uterine Sarcoma AJCC v7|Uterine Carcinosarcoma,DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Paclitaxel|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment,"Overall Survival, Measured in months from randomization to last contact or death.
