NCT02989857,Study of AG-120 in Previously Treated Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma With IDH1 Mutations (ClarIDHy),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02989857,ClarIDHy,COMPLETED,"Study AG120-C-005 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of orally administered AG-120. Participants, all personnel involved in the evaluation of participants' response to treatment (e.g., Investigators, study coordinators, study pharmacists), and designated Sponsor team members will be blinded to study treatment. Participants are required to have a histologically-confirmed diagnosis of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) gene-mutated cholangiocarcinoma that is not eligible for curative resection, transplantation, or ablative therapies prior to enrollment. IDH1 mutation testing will be performed at participating investigative sites. Participants must have progression of disease and have received at least 1 but not more than 2 prior treatment regimens for advanced disease (nonresectable or metastatic). All participants must have received either a gemcitabine or a 5 fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy regimen.",YES,Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma|Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma,DRUG: AG-120|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Independent Radiology Committee (IRC), PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression as assessed by the IRC using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] v1.1, or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as greater than or equal to (≥)20 percent (%) increase in sum of the diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter recorded since the treatment started. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm) or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause (Up to approximately 2 years)","Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in participants, whether or not considered drug related. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (an SAE) if it is fatal, life-threatening, causes in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother or father exposed to study treatment or is an important medical event.

ECOG PS: 0 = fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction; 1 = restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work; 2 = ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours; 3 = capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; 4 = completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair. A higher score means a worse functional status., Baseline|Percentage of Participants Who Required At Least One Concomitant Medications During the Treatment, Concomitant medications were medications that were ongoing or initiated after the first dose of the study drug but before the last dose plus 28 days.

For EORTC QLQ-C30, subscales of physical functioning, pain, and appetite loss were assessed. These had 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much). For functional scales, higher scores=better QOL (positive change from Baseline=improvement). For symptom scales, lower scores=better QOL (negative change from Baseline=improvement). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized, so that scores ranged from 0 to 100., Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Change From Baseline in HRQOL Based on: Quality of Life Questionnaire - Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder Cancer Module (QLQ-BIL21), For HRQOL based on QLQ-BIL21, subscales of eating symptoms and pain symptoms were assessed. Each item is a 4-point Likert scale. There are 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much). Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For symptom scales, lower scores=better QOL (negative change from Baseline=improvement)., Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Change Based on HRQOL: Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C), The PGI-C is a self-rated evaluative instrument for assessment across 3 domains (physical function, appetite loss, and pain).

A lower score indicates a worse outcome. Percentages are rounded off to whole number at the nearest decimal., Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Severity Based on HRQOL: Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S), The anchor-based questionnaire PGI-S contains the following 3 items (the severity of the physical functioning decline over the past week, the severity of the appetite decrease over the past week, and the severity of the pain over the past week). The PGI-S was measured using the possible outcomes none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe. Percentages are rounded off to whole number at the nearest decimal., Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Each EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Dimension Response, The EQ-5D-5L assesses general health-related quality of life. Health is defined in 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Percentages are rounded off to whole number at the nearest decimal., Cycle 3 Day 1|Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS) Score, The EQ visual analogue scale records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled ""The best health you can imagine"" and ""The worst health you can imagine."" Responses are marked on a 0-100 scale with higher scores indicating higher health-related quality of life (i.e., better outcome)., Cycle 3 Day 1|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of AG-120, Crossover C1D1 and crossover C2D1 visits were combined with C1D1 and C2D1 visits, respectively for the analysis of this endpoint., Post-dose Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle = 28 days)|Time to Reach Maximal Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of AG-120, Crossover C1D1 and crossover C2D1 visits were combined with C1D1 and C2D1 visits, respectively for the analysis of this endpoint., Post-dose Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle = 28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC0-24), Crossover C2D1 visit was combined with C2D1 visit for the analysis of this endpoint., Post-dose of Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle = 28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to 4 Hours (AUC0-4), Crossover C1D1 and crossover C2D1 visits were combined with C1D1 and C2D1 visits, respectively for the analysis of this endpoint., Post-dose of Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle = 28 days)|Accumulation Ratio Based on AUC0-4 (Racc AUC0-4), Crossover C2D1 visit was combined with C2D1 visit for the analysis of this endpoint., Post-dose Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle = 28 days)|Accumulation Ratio Based on Cmax (Racc Cmax), Crossover C2D1 visit was combined with C2D1 visit for the analysis of this endpoint., Post-dose Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle = 28 days)|Plasma 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) Levels of AG-120: B (Baseline Effect Value), B is the Baseline Effect Value.
