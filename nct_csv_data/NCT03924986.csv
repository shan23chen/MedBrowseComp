NCT03924986,Tislelizumab Combined With Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03924986,RATIONALE-309,COMPLETED,This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab (BGB-A317) combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus placebo combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.,YES,Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer,DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin,"Progression-free Survival as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Defined as the time from randomization to the first objectively documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, as assessed by the IRC per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 is a questionnaire that assesses quality of life of participants with cancer. It includes global health status and quality of life questions related to overall health in which participants respond based on a 7-point scale, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A higher score indicates better health outcomes., Baseline to Cycle 6 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Head and Neck-351 (EORTC QLQ-H&N35) Index Score, The QLQ-H\&N35 consists of thirty-five questions that are associated with eighteen symptom scales (pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, sexuality, problem with teeth, problem opening mouth, dry mouth, problem with sense smell, cough, felt ill, pain med, nutritional supplements, feeding tube, weight loss and weight gain).. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. The index score is calculated as an average of the 18 symptom scales. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in symptoms., Baseline to Cycle 6 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations (PEs ), graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. For Arm B, only adverse events reported prior to participants crossing over to receive tislelizumab monotherapy are included., From first dose to 30 days after last dose or new anticancer therapy, or until Dec 8, 2023 data cut-off; max treatment duration: 231 weeks (Arm A), 202 weeks (Arm B).",,BeiGene,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,263,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",BGB-A317-309|CTR20182534,2019-03-27,2021-03-26,2023-12-08,2019-04-23,2025-03-25,2025-03-25,"Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, 230000, China|Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100142, China|Chongqing Cancer Hospital, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400030, China|Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, Chongqing, 404000, China|Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350014, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China|Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat Sen University (North), Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510000, China|Cancer Center of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510030, China|Sun Yat Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China|Guangdong Provincial Peoples Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510405, China|Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, 515031, China|Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, 524000, China|The Peoples Hospital of Zhongshan City, Zhongshan, Guangdong, 528403, China|The Fifth Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat Sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, 519000, China|The Peoples Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China|The Tumor Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China|Hainan General Hospital, Haikou, Hainan, 570206, China|Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150000, China|Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430022, China|Hubei Cancer Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, 430079, China|Changsha Central Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, 410004, China|Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, 410013, China|Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 201203, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University Branch Donghu, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330006, China|Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200032, China|Shanghai East Hospital, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200120, China|Sichuan Cancer Hospital and Institute, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China|West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China|Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310022, China|Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, 50006, Taiwan|Veterans General Hospital Taichung, Taichung, 40705, Taiwan|National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, 704, Taiwan|Ramathibodi Hospital Mahidol University Hematology, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand|Songklanagarind Hospital (Prince of Songkhla University), Hat Yai, 90110, Thailand|Srinagarind Hospital (Khon Kaen University), Muang, 40002, Thailand|Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital (Chiang Mai University), Muang, 50200, Thailand","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/86/NCT03924986/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/86/NCT03924986/SAP_001.pdf"
