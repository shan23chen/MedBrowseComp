NCT00003150,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Older Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003150,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without rituximab for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with or without rituximab in treating older patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",NO,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|DRUG: CHOP regimen|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: prednisone|DRUG: vincristine sulfate,,,,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Cancer and Leukemia Group B|SWOG Cancer Research Network,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,630,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000065935|ECOG-E4494|CLB-9793|SWOG-E4494,1997-12,,2006-09,2004-02-16,,2013-06-21,"MBCCOP - Gulf Coast, Mobile, Alabama, 36688, United States|CCOP - Greater Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006-2726, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Phoenix (Hayden), Phoenix, Arizona, 85012, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, 85723, United States|Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona, 85724, United States|University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Little Rock (McClellan), Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Cancer Center and Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, 91010-3000, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Long Beach, Long Beach, California, 90822, United States|USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital, Los Angeles, California, 90033-0804, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, 90073, United States|Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, 90095-1781, United States|Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic - Martinez, Martinez, California, 94553, United States|CCOP - Bay Area Tumor Institute, Oakland, California, 94609-3305, United States|Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Orange, California, 92868, United States|University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|CCOP - Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|David Grant Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, California, 94535, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver, Colorado, 80010, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Denver, Denver, Colorado, 80220, United States|Hematology Oncology Associates, Atlantis, Florida, 33462, United States|CCOP - Atlanta Regional, Atlanta, Georgia, 30342-1701, United States|Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, 30905-5650, United States|Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813, United States|MBCCOP - University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60612-7323, United States|CCOP - Central Illinois, Decatur, Illinois, 62526, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Hines (Hines Junior VA Hospital), Hines, Illinois, 60141, United States|Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, 60153, United States|University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160-7357, United States|CCOP - Wichita, Wichita, Kansas, 67214-3882, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Wichita, Wichita, Kansas, 67218, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Lexington, Lexington, Kentucky, 40511-1093, United States|Albert B.
