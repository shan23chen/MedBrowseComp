NCT02853331,Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Axitinib Versus Sunitinib Monotherapy in Participants With Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-3475-426/KEYNOTE-426),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02853331,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with axitinib versus sunitinib monotherapy as a first-line treatment for participants with advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).

The primary hypotheses of this study are:

1. The combination therapy of pembrolizumab plus axitinib is superior to sunitinib monotherapy with respect to Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central imaging review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)
2. The combination therapy of pembrolizumab plus axitinib is superior to sunitinib monotherapy with respect to Overall Survival (OS).",YES,Renal Cell Carcinoma,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Axitinib|DRUG: Sunitinib,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Imaging Review, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The PFS for participants is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the interim analysis were censored at the date of the last follow up. The OS was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The OS for participants is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)","Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Imaging Review, ORR was determined per RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1. The ORR was calculated using the Miettinen \& Nurminen method stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group (favorable vs. intermediate vs. poor) and geographic region (North America vs. Western Europe vs. Rest of World). The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Imaging Review, DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions), Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), or Stable Disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1 for ≥6 months. The DCR was calculated using the Miettinen \& Nurminen method stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group (favorable vs. intermediate vs. poor) and geographic region (North America vs. Western Europe vs. Rest of World). The percentage of participants who experienced a CR, PR, or SD is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Imaging Review, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 until progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD was defined per RECIST 1.1 as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The DOR was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The DOR for all participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)|Progression Free Survival Rate (PFS Rate) at Month 12 in All Participants, The PFS rate was determined in all participants at Month 12. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The date of PD was approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD was documented per RECIST 1.1 by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Death was always considered as confirmed PD. Participants who did not experience PFS were censored at the last disease assessment.

The FKSI-DRS was a questionnaire that asked the participant to rate 9 kidney cancer-related symptoms: lack of energy, fatigue, weight loss, pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, cough, fever, or blood in the urine. Each item was scored on a 5-point scale (0=not at all to 4=very much). FKSI-DRS total score ranged from 0 (most severe symptoms) to 36 (no symptoms) with a higher score indicating a better outcome. Deterioration was defined as a 3-point decrease (i.e. lower score) in symptom score and the time to true deterioration was the time to first onset of 3 or more decreases from baseline with confirmation under right-censoring rule (the last observation). The time to true deterioration as measured in months is presented., Through Database Cutoff Date of 24-Aug-2018 (up to approximately 22 months)|Least Squares (LS) Mean Change From Baseline to Week 54 in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status (GHS) Scale Score, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties.
