NCT00312377,ZACTIMA (an Anti-EGFR / Anti-VEGF Agent) Combined With Docetaxel Compared to Docetaxel in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00312377,ZODIAC,COMPLETED,"This large phase III clinical study is studying the effect of vandetanib (ZACTIMA) in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Vandetanib is a new type of agent that targets the blood supply to a cancer tumour (through it's anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) properties) and the tumour cells themselves (through it's anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) actions). This study will look at the effects of vandetanib in lung cancer patients who have had their cancer re-appear after treatment with standard chemotherapy.

This clinical study will test if the vandetanib anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR characteristics can deliver longer improved progression free survival and improved overall survival than docetaxel (Taxotere) alone.

All patients participating this clinical study will receive treatment with docetaxel, a commonly used treatment for recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

In addition, some patients will also receive vandetanib (ZACTIMA), an anti-EGFR / anti-VEGF agent.

Recent clinical research shows that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition, when used with standard chemotherapy, can lead to increased survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

Other research shows that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, like erlotinib (Tarceva) can also increase overall non-small cell lung cancer survival by killing tumour cells and stopping them from dividing.",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Lung Cancer,DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Vandetanib,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Overall Population, Median time (in weeks) from randomisation until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment. Progression was derived according to RECIST 1.0 and is defined as an increase of at least 20% in the total tumour size of measurable lesions over the nadir measurement, unequivocal progression in the non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks from randomisation until the date of first documented objective disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first assessed up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Female Population, Median time (in weeks) from randomisation until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment. Progression was derived according to RECIST 1.0 and is defined as an increase of at least 20% in the total tumour size of measurable lesions over the nadir measurement, unequivocal progression in the non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks from randomisation until the date of first documented objective disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first assessed up to 24 months","Overall Survival (OS) in the Overall Population, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until death. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive (ie their status must be known at the censored date and should not be lost to follow up or unknown)., Time to death in months|Overall Survival (OS) in the Female Population, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until death. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive (ie their status must be known at the censored date and should not be lost to follow up or unknown)., Time to death in months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is the number of patients that are responders ie those patients with a confirmed best objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined according to RECIST 1.0. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions with no evidence of tumour elsewhere and PR is defined as at least a 30% reduction in the total tumour size of measurable lesions with no new lesions and no progression in the non-target lesions., Each patient was assessed for objective response from the sequence of RECIST scan data up to data cut off. RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective progression|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients who achieved disease control at least 6 weeks following randomisation. Disease control at 6 weeks is defined as a best objective response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) \>= 6 weeks as determined according to RECIST 1.0. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions with no evidence of tumour elsewhere, PR is defined as at least a 30% reduction in the total tumour size of measurable lesions with no new lesions and no progression in the non-target lesions and SD \>= 6 is assigned to patients who have not responded and have no evidence of progression at least 6 weeks after randomisation., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective progression|Duration of Response (DoR), Response is defined as a confirmed best objective response of CR or PR. Duration of response is defined as time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (provided death is within 3 months of last RECIST assessment), RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective progression|Time to Deterioration of Disease-related Symptoms (TDS) by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS)., The lung cancer subscale (LCS) consists of 7 items of the FACT-L (3 items relating to breathing/dyspnea, and 1 item each relating to cough, weight loss, appetite, and cognition). The LCS total score is the sum of the scores from the 7 items.

Time to deterioration is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the first assessment of worsened without an improvement in the next 21 days.

A patient will be defined as having a deterioration in symptoms if they have a single visit assessment of 'worsened' with no visit assessment of 'improved' within the next 21 days., FACT-L questionnaires are to be administered every 3 weeks after randomisation|Time to Deterioration of Disease-related Symptoms (TDS) by FACT-L Pulmonary Symptom Index (PSI), The pulmonary symptom index (PSI) consists of 4 items of the LCS relating to pulmonary symptoms (i.e. 3 items relating to breathing/dyspnea, and 1 item relating to cough). The PSI score is the sum of the scores from the 4 items.

Time to deterioration is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the first assessment of worsened without an improvement in the next 21 days.

A patient will be defined as having a deterioration in symptoms if they have a single visit assessment of 'worsened' with no visit assessment of 'improved' within the next 21 days., FACT-L
