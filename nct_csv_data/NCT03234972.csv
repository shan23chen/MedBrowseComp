NCT03234972,"A Study to Compare Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (DVd) vs Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) in Chinese Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03234972,,COMPLETED,"The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of daratumumab when combined with Velcade (bortezomib) and dexamethasone (DVd) to that of Velcade and dexamethasone (Vd), in terms of progression free survival (PFS) in Chinese participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).",NO,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Velcade|DRUG: Dexamethasone,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is duration from date of randomization to either PD (as per international myeloma working group \[IMWG\] criteria) or death whichever occurs first. PD: Increase of 25 percent (%) from lowest response value in one of following: Serum M-component and urine M-component (absolute increase must be greater than or equal to \[\>=\]0.5 gram per deciliter \[g/dL\] and \>=200 mg/24 hours respectively); Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels (absolute increase must be \>10 mg/dL); only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels and without measurable disease by FLC levels, bone marrow plasma cell (PC) percentage (absolute percentage must be \>=10%); definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL)., From the date of randomization to either progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first (approximately up to 4.5 years)","Time to Disease Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as time from date of randomization to date of first documented evidence of PD. PD per IMWG criteria: Increase of 25 % from lowest response value in one of following: Serum M-component and urine M-component (absolute increase must be \>=0.5 g/dL and \>=200 mg/24 hours respectively); Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be greater than \[\>\]10 mg/dL); only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels and without measurable disease by FLC levels, bone marrow PC percentage (absolute percentage must be \>=10%); definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL)., From the date of randomization to the date of first documented evidence of PD (approximately up to 4.5 years)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is percentage of participants who achieve partial response (PR) or better (stringent complete response \[sCR\], complete response \[CR\], VGPR), according to the IMWG criteria, during the study or during follow up. PR: \>=50% reduction of serum M-protein, \>=90% reduction in 24 hour urinary M-protein or to \<200 mg/24 hours; if serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, \>=50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels; if serum and urine M-protein and serum free light assay is not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow PC, with baseline bone marrow PC percentage \>=30%; if present at baseline, \>=50% reduction in size of soft tissue plasmacytomas; VGPR: serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation or \>=90.0% reduction in serum M-protein and urine M-protein \<100mg/24 hours; CR: negative immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5.0% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal PCs., Approximately up to 4.5 years|Percentage of Participants With a Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better, VGPR or better rate defined as the percentage of participants achieving VGPR and CR (including sCR) according to the IMWG criteria during or after the study treatment. IMWG criteria for VGPR: Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or \>=90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein \<100 mg/24 hours; CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \<5% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR and normal FLC ratio, absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or 2 to 4 color flow cytometry., Approximately up to 4.5 years|Time to Response, Time to response, defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first efficacy evaluation that the participant has met all criteria for response (PR or better rate). IMWG criteria for PR: \>=50% reduction of serum M-protein, \>=90% reduction in 24 hour urinary M-protein or to \<200 mg/24 hours; if serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, \>=50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels; if serum and urine M-protein and serum free light assay is not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow PC, with baseline bone marrow PC percentage \>=30%; if present at baseline, \>=50% reduction in size of soft tissue plasmacytomas; VGPR: serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation or \>=90.0% reduction in serum M-protein and urine M-protein \<100mg/24 hours; CR: negative immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5.0% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal PCs., From the date of randomization and the first efficacy evaluation that the participant has met all criteria for response (PR or better rate) (approximately up to 4.5 years)|Duration of Response, Duration of response will be calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria. IMWG criteria for PR: \>=50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours, if the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria,If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow PCs is required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was \>=30% in addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, a \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., From the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better rate) to the date of first documented evidence of PD (approximately up to 4.5 years)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is measured from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death., From date of randomization to the date of the participant's death (approximately up to 4.5 years)|Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score, EQ-5D-5L is a 5 item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating ""health today"" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single utility score ranging from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0), with higher values representing better general health status of the individual., Baseline up to Weeks 8 and 16 post PD (Approximately up to 4.5 years)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that includes 30 items resulting in 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 Global Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The recall period is 1 week (the past week). Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score for the global health status scale represents greater quality of life, a higher score for a functional scale represents greater functioning, and a higher score for a symptom scale/item represents more symptomatology/problems., Baseline up to Weeks 8 and 16 post PD (Approximately up to 4.5 years)",,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,213,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CR104378|54767414MMY3009,2017-11-30,2019-10-07,2024-02-27,2017-08-01,,2024-05-29,"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, 100032, China|Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China|Peking University People s Hospital, Beijing, 100044, China|Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100083, China|The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China|West China Hospital Si Chuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China|Xinqiao Hospital of the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China|Fujian Meidical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, 350001, China|Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou, 510080, China|The First Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China|Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, 510515, China|First Affiliated Hospital Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310020, China|First affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310020, China|Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing, 210008, China|Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China|Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China|Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai, 200003, China|Ruijin Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200025, China|First Affiliated Hospital SooChow University, Suzhou, 215006, China|Tianjin cancer hospital, Tianjin, 300040, China|Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China|Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, 300320, China|Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of HUST, Wuhan, 430030, China|Tangdu Hospital, Xian, 710038, China|Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China|National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, 10048, Taiwan|Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, 11490, Taiwan",
