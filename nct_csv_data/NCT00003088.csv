NCT00003088,Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003088,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs at different times or combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy consisting of either doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, or paclitaxel given at different times with that of combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel in treating women with stage II or stage IIIA breast cancer.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: paclitaxel,"Disease free survival, 4 years",,,Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology,National Cancer Institute (NCI),FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,2005,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CALGB-9741|U10CA031946|CALGB-9741|CDR0000065788,1997-09,2003-04,2003-06,2004-09-06,,2020-04-29,"CCOP - Scottsdale Oncology Program, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259-5404, United States|CCOP - Illinois Oncology Research Association, Peoria, Illinois, 61602, United States|CCOP - Carle Cancer Center, Urbana, Illinois, 61801, United States|CCOP - Cedar Rapids Oncology Project, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 52403-1206, United States|CCOP - Iowa Oncology Research Association, Des Moines, Iowa, 10309-1016, United States|Siouxland Hematology-Oncology, Sioux City, Iowa, 51101-1733, United States|CCOP - Ochsner, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70121, United States|CCOP - Ann Arbor Regional, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48106, United States|CCOP - Duluth, Duluth, Minnesota, 55805, United States|Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|CentraCare Clinic, Saint Cloud, Minnesota, 56303, United States|CCOP - Missouri Valley Cancer Consortium, Omaha, Nebraska, 68131, United States|Quain & Ramstad Clinic, P.C., Bismarck, North Dakota, 58501, United States|CCOP - Merit Care Hospital, Fargo, North Dakota, 58122, United States|Altru Health Systems, Grand Forks, North Dakota, 58201, United States|CCOP - Toledo Community Hospital Oncology Program, Toledo, Ohio, 43623-3456, United States|Rapid City Regional Hospital, Rapid City, South Dakota, 57709, United States|CCOP - Sioux Community Cancer Consortium, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 57105-1080, United States|Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Regina, Saskatchewan, S4S 6X3, Canada",
