NCT01203228,Dose-reduced Versus Standard Conditioning in MDS/sAML,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01203228,RICMAC,TERMINATED,"In this trial dose reduced conditioning is compared to standard conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation from related or unrelated donors in patients with MDS or secondary AML.

Conditioning is the very high dose chemotherapy treatment that is given in the days before the stem cell transplant.

The hypothesis is that a dose reduced conditioning will reduce the non-relapse mortality from 40% to 20% at one year after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",NO,Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia,OTHER: Reduced Intensity Conditioning|OTHER: Myeloablative conditioning,"non-relapse mortality, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at one year after allogeneic stem cell transplantation","organ related toxicity of conditioning, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at day +30 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|Incidence of aGVHD, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at day +100 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|incidence of cGVHD, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at one year after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|overall survival, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at 2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|event-free survival, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at 2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|cumulative incidence of relapse, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at 2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|VOD, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at day +100 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|infection incidence, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at day +100, 1 year and 2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|Haematopoeitic recovery, every 6 months for safety and in the final analysis at day +30 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation",,European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Pierre Fabre Medicament,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,129,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2005-002011-24|EBMT 42205525,2004-05,2015-01,2015-02,2010-09-16,,2015-04-03,"University Hospital, Düsseldorf, Germany|Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany|University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany|University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany|UKSH Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany|University Hospital, Köln, Germany|University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany|Universitätsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany|University Hospital, Tübingen, Germany|Santi Antonio e Biagio, Alessandria, Italy|Ospedale di Careggi, Firenze, Italy|Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Milano, Italy|Radboud University MC, Nijmegen, Netherlands|SPb State I.
