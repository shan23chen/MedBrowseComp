Total score ranges from 0-168. Higher scores indicate a better PRO/QoL. In timeframe, follow-up months represents months after end of induction (e.g. Follow-up Month 2 is 2 months after end of induction) and extension follow-up months represents months after end of 2 years normal follow-up (e.g. extension follow-up Month 6 is 6 months after end of normal 2 year follow-up)., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 3, 4, 5, End of induction treatment (up to Month 6); Follow-up Months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, Final Follow-up (up to 2 years after end of induction); Extension follow-up Months 6, 18 and 24|Time to Deterioration of FACT-Lym TOI, The median time, in month, from date of randomization until a clinically meaningful decline from baseline in TOI or death, whichever occurred first. TOI: sum of physical well-being score,functional well-being score, and Lymphoma sub-scale of FACT-Lym; total 29 items, responses to each item range from 0, ""Not at all"" to 4, ""Very much"". Total score ranges from 0-116. Higher scores indicate a better PRO/QoL. A clinically meaningful decline in TOI score was defined as at least a 6 point decline from baseline. Time to deterioration was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI for median was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley. In timeframe, follow-up months represents months after end of induction (EOI) (e.g. Follow-up Month 2 is 2 months after end of induction) and extension follow-up months represents months after end of 2 years normal follow-up (e.g. extension follow-up Month 6 is 6 months after end of normal 2 year follow-up)., Baseline up to approximately 8.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Definitive Improvement (DI) From Baseline in FACT-Lym Instrument Scores, FACT-Lym: 42-items in 5 subscales. Responses to each item range from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). FACT-Lym Lymphoma subscale includes 15 items (total score range = 0-60). FACT-Lym TOI is sum of 3 subscales (physical well-being, functional well-being, lymphoma subscale) and includes 29 items (total score range = 0-116). FACT-Lym total score is sum of 42 items (total score ranges from 0-168). For all above, higher scores indicate a better PRO/QoL. DI from baseline: at least 3 point increase from baseline in FACT-Lym Lymphoma subscale; at least 6 point increase from baseline in FACT Lym TOI; at least 7 point increase from baseline in FACT Lym total scores. In timeframe, follow-up months represents months after EOI (e.g. Follow-up Month 2 is 2 months after EOI; EOI = up to Month 6)., Baseline, Cycle 5 Day 1 (C5D1) (Cycle length = 28 days), Follow-up Months 6 (FUM6), 12 (FUM12), 18 (FUM18), 24 (FUM24), Extension Follow Up Month 6 (Extension FUM6)",,"Genentech, Inc.",Roche Pharma AG,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,413,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,GAO4753g|GO01297|2009-015504-25,2010-04-30,2014-09-30,2018-11-30,2010-02-01,2016-11-17,2020-01-13,"Southern Cancer Center, PC, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Dr. Donald W.
