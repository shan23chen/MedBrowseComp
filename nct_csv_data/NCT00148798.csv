NCT00148798,Study of Cisplatin/Vinorelbine +/- Cetuximab as First-line Treatment of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (FLEX),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00148798,FLEX,COMPLETED,The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy in comparison to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer who did not received prior chemotherapy. Overall survival will be taken as primary measure of efficacy.,YES,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),DRUG: cetuximab + cisplatin + vinorelbine|DRUG: cisplatin + vinorelbine,"Overall Survival Time (OS), Time from randomization to death. Patients without event are censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whatever is earlier., Time from randomisation to death or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first patient randomised, Oct 2004, until cut-off date 18 Jul 2007","Progression-free Survival Time, Duration from randomization until radiological progression (based on modified World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria) or death due to any cause.

Only deaths within 60 days of last tumor assessment are considered. Patients without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment., Time from randomization to disease progression, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first patient randomised, Oct 2004, until cut-off date 18 Jul 2007|Best Overall Response Rate, The best overall response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response as the best overall response according to radiological assessments (based on modified WHO criteria)., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first patient randomised, Oct 2004, until cut-off date 18 Jul 2007|Disease Control Rate, The disease control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease as best overall response according to radiological assessments (based on modified WHO criteria)., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first patient randomised, Oct 2004, until cut-off date 18 Jul 2007|Quality of Life (QOL) Assessment European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 Global Health Status, Mean global health status scores (EORTC QLQ-C30) against time for each treatment group. Scores were derived from mutually exclusive sets of items, with scale scores ranging from 0 to 100 after a linear transformation. Higher scores indicate a better QoL., at baseline, at cycle 3, at month 6, reported between day of first patient randomised, Oct 2004, until cut-off date 18 Jul 2007|Quality of Life Assessment (EORTC QLQ-C30) Social Functioning, Mean social functioning scores (EORTC QLQ-C30) against time for each treatment group. Scores were derived from mutually exclusive sets of items, with scale scores ranging from 0 to 100 after a linear transformation. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning., at baseline, at cycle 3, at month 6, reported between day of first patient randomised, Oct 2004, until cut-off date 18 Jul 2007|A Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis for Cetuximab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) - Serum Cetuximab Concentrations, Population PK analysis was conducted using non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software, integrating the PK data from this study and the Phase II study EMR 62 202-011., Week 1, Day 1: baseline and end of infusion; Week 7, Day 43: within 12 h after cetuximab administration.|Safety - Number of Patients Experiencing Any Adverse Event, Please refer to Adverse Events section for further details, time from first dose up to 30 after last dose of study treatment, reported between day of first patient randomised, Oct 2004, until cut-off date 18 Jul 2007",,"Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1861,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EMR 62202-046,2004-10,2007-07,2012-05,2005-09-08,2011-10-04,2014-06-25,"Research Site, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Research Site, Cordoba, Argentina|Research Site, Adelaide, Australia|Research Site, Melbourne, Australia|Research Site, Randwick, Australia|Research Site, Sydney, Australia|Research Site, Wodonga, Australia|Research Site, Wien, Austria|Research Site, Bruxelles, Belgium|Research Site, Charleroi, Belgium|Research Site, Liège, Belgium|Research Site, Porto Alegre, Brazil|Research Site, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Research Site, Pleven, Bulgaria|Research Site, Sofia, Bulgaria|Research Site, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria|Research Site, Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria|Research Site, Antofagasta, Chile|Research Site, Santiago de Chile, Chile|Research Site, Brno, Czech Republic|Research Site, Ostrava, Czech Republic|Research Site, Pilsen, Czech Republic|Research Site, Praha, Czech Republic|Research Site, Brest, France|Research Site, Caen, France|Research Site, Grenoble, France|Research Site, Marseille, France|Research Site, Paris, France|Research Site, Poitiers, France|Research Site, Rennes, France|Research Site, Rouen, France|Research Site, Strasbourg, France|Research Site, Augsburg, Germany|Research Site, Berlin, Germany|Research Site, Essen, Germany|Research Site, Freiburg, Germany|Research Site, Gauting, Germany|Research Site, Großhansdorf, Germany|Research Site, Göttingen, Germany|Research Site, Halle-Dölau, Germany|Research Site, Hamburg, Germany|Research Site, Heidelberg, Germany|Research Site, Köln, Germany|Research Site, Löwenstein, Germany|Research Site, Magdeburg, Germany|Research Site, Mainz, Germany|Research Site, München, Germany|Research Site, Stralsund, Germany|Research Site, Wuppertal, Germany|Research Site, Honh Kong, Hong Kong|Research Site, Budapest, Hungary|Research Site, Nyiregyháza, Hungary|Research Site, Szombathely, Hungary|Research Site, Székesfehérvár, Hungary|Research Site, Torokbalint, Hungary|Research Site, Zalegerzeg-Pózva, Hungary|Research Site, Dublin, Ireland|Research Site, Bologna, Italy|Research Site, Carpi, Italy|Research Site, Milano, Italy|Research Site, Rome, Italy|Research Site, Rozzano-Milano, Italy|Research Site, Treviglio, Italy|Research Site, Seoul, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Mexico-City, Mexico|Research Site, Monterrey, Mexico|Research Site, Amsterdam, Netherlands|Research Site, Nieuwegeln, Netherlands|Research Site, Zwolle, Netherlands|Research Site, Bydgoszcz, Poland|Research Site, Olsztyn, Poland|Research Site, Otwock, Poland|Research Site, Posnan, Poland|Research Site, Warszawa, Poland|Research Site, Wroclaw, Poland|Research Site, Moscow, Russian Federation|Research Site, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation|Research Site, Singapore, Singapore|Research Site, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia|Research Site, Bratislava, Slovakia|Research Site, Nitra-Zobor, Slovakia|Research Site, Poprad, Slovakia|Research Site, Barakaldo (Bilbao), Spain|Research Site, Barcelona, Spain|Research Site, Elche Alicante, Spain|Research Site, Granollers, Spain|Research Site, Madrid, Spain|Research Site, Pamplona, Spain|Research Site, Pontevedra, Spain|Research Site, San Sebastian, Spain|Research Site, Santander, Spain|Research Site, Terrassa, Spain|Research Site, Valencia, Spain|Research Site, Stockholm, Sweden|Research Site, Uppsala, Sweden|Research Site, Bern, Switzerland|Research Site, Thun, Switzerland|Research Site, Zürich, Switzerland|Research Site, Taipei, Tao Yuan County, Taiwan|Research Site, Taipei, Taiwan|Research Site, Ankara, Turkey|Research Site, Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine|Research Site, Kharkiv, Ukraine|Research Site, Kyiv, Ukraine|Research Site, Lviv, Ukraine|Research Site, Poltava, Ukraine|Research Site, Sumy, Ukraine|Research Site, Ternopol, Ukraine|Research Site, Uzhgorod, Ukraine|Research Site, Aberdeen, United Kingdom|Research Site, Bristol, United Kingdom|Research Site, Edinburgh, United Kingdom|Research Site, Leicester, United Kingdom|Research Site, London, United Kingdom|Research Site, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom|Research Site, Poole, United Kingdom|Research Site, Sutton, United Kingdom|Research Site, Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",
