NCT01905657,Study of Two Doses of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Docetaxel in Previously Treated Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-010/KEYNOTE-010),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01905657,,COMPLETED,"This study compared two doses of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus docetaxel in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had experienced disease progression after platinum-containing systemic therapy. Participants were assigned randomly to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W), pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W or docetaxel 75 mg/m\^2 Q3W. The total number of participants randomized depended upon demonstration of sufficient objective responses at an interim analysis.

Eligible participants who were allocated to the first course of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W) and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to receive a second course of pembrolizumab as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.

Protocol Amendment 12 (effective date: 09 Dec 2015) enabled eligible participants who were allocated to docetaxel and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to switch over to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.

With Protocol Amendment 15 (effective date: 03 Jan 2018), all second course and switch over participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Response or progression during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards efficacy outcome measures, and adverse events during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards safety outcome measures.

Also with Amendment 15, once a participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, the participant will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study (Keynote 587; NCT03486873) to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment. Switch over participants who have not transitioned to pembrolizumab will be considered for the extension study on a case-by-case basis.

The primary study hypotheses are that pembolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by independent radiologists' review in previously-treated participants with NSCLC in the strongly positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) stratum compared to docetaxel and in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 compared to docetaxel.",YES,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel,"Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months. Per protocol, final analysis for this primary outcome measure was performed for the first pembrolizumab course and docetaxel treatment arms, with a protocol-specified analysis data cutoff date of 30 September (Sep) 2015., Through pre-specified database cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015 (Up to approximately 24 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central radiologists' review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Using RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as either a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study OR an absolute increase of \>5 mm in the sum of lesions, OR the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months. Per protocol, final analysis for this primary outcome measure was performed for the first pembrolizumab course and docetaxel treatment arms, with a protocol-specified analysis data cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015., Through pre-specified database cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015 (Up to approximately 24 months)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily had to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the study drug, was also an AE. Per protocol, final analysis for this primary outcome measure was performed for the first pembrolizumab course and docetaxel treatment arms, with a protocol-specified analysis data cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015., Through pre-specified database cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015 (Up to approximately 24 months)|Percentage of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to AEs, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily had to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the study drug, was also an AE. Per protocol, final analysis for this primary outcome measure was performed for the first pembrolizumab course and docetaxel treatment arms, with a protocol-specified analysis data cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015., Through pre-specified database cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015 (Up to approximately 24 months)","Overall Response Rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters) based on blinded independent central radiologists' review using RECIST 1.1. Per protocol, final analysis for this secondary outcome measure was performed for the first pembrolizumab course and docetaxel treatment arms, with a protocol-specified analysis data cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015., Through pre-specified database cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015 (Up to approximately 24 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) by RECIST 1.1, DOR is measured from the time measurement criteria were first met for CR/PR (whichever was first recorded) until the first date that death or progressive disease was objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). Non-responders were not included in the analysis. DOR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in weeks. Per protocol, final analysis for this secondary outcome measure was performed for the first pembrolizumab course and docetaxel treatment arms, with a protocol-specified analysis data cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015., Through pre-specified database cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015 (Up to approximately 24 months)",,Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,1034,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,3475-010|2012-004391-19|132355|MK-3475-010|KEYNOTE-010,2013-08-09,2015-09-30,2020-09-30,2013-07-23,2017-01-18,2021-10-06,,"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/57/NCT01905657/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
