NCT01502241,Phase III Trial of Primary Radio- or Chemotherapy in Malignant Astrocytoma of the Elderly,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01502241,Methusalem,COMPLETED,"The study aims to optimize the treatment of elderly subjects (\> 65) with anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma. Current treatment policies tend to be no more than palliative. There is no consensus as to how radical the surgery should be. Involved-field radiotherapy is the treatment most likely to be accepted apart from supportive and palliative measures. The role of chemotherapy is barely defined. Study data available to date does not suggest that this patient population would benefit from combined radiochemotherapy. The aim of the study is to verify the hypothesis that first-line chemotherapy with one week on/one week off temozolomide is not inferior to extended-field radiotherapy in the first-line treatment of anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma in the elderly (\> 65 age group). The primary endpoint is median survival, as life expectancy is limited to several months. Secondary endpoints are response rates in both arms (CR, PR, MacDonald et al. 1990), median progression-free survival, 1-year and 2-year survival rates, definition of MGMT as molecular genetic prognostic or predictive markers, and quality of life. Theoretically, it should be possible to preserve quality of life in the first-line chemotherapy arm of the study.",NO,Glioblastoma|Anaplastic Astrocytoma,DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Radiotherapy of the partial brain.,"Overall survival, The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured in days from surgery to death for any reason. Patients alive at the day of the last contact were censored., 12 months","Event-free survival, Secondary efficacy end points included EFS. EFS was defined as time from surgery to first progression for patients with progression respectively to death for patients without progression. Patients without progression or death were censored at the day of the last contact. Univariate analysis of OS and EFS used Kaplan-Meier estimates21 and a Cox proportional hazard model for evaluating Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95%-confidence intervals and median OS and EFS with 95%-confidence intervals (CI)., 12 months|Best response, Response is assessed according MacDonald Criteria based on regular 3-monthly MRI., Within the first 8 months after surgery|Molecular prognostic or predictive biomarkers, Tumor tissue, fresh or paraffine-embedded, or DNA/RNA/proteins from tissue are analyzed for the status of known molecular parameters, e.g. MGMT, for a prognostic or predictive role. Further, newly discovered molecular parameters are assessed for their potential to predict outcome., At 12 months",,Heidelberg University,,ALL,OLDER_ADULT,PHASE3,412,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NOA-08|05-01,2005-01,2010-11,2011-11,2011-12-30,,2011-12-30,"University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, 69120, Germany|University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Hessen, 60528, Germany|Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany|University of Bochum, Bochum, Germany|University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany|University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany|University of Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany|University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany|University of Essen, Essen, Germany|University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany|University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany|University of Hannover II, Hannover, Germany|University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany|University of Homburg, Homburg, Germany|University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany|University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany|University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany|University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany|University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany|University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany|University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany|University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany|University of Zurich, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland",
