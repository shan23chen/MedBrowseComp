NCT00002633,Hormone Therapy With or Without Surgery or Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00002633,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Hormones can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known whether hormone therapy plus surgery is more effective than hormone therapy plus radiation therapy for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving hormone therapy alone to see how well it works compared to giving hormone therapy together with bilateral orchiectomy or radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV prostate cancer.",NO,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: bicalutamide|DRUG: buserelin|DRUG: flutamide|DRUG: goserelin|DRUG: leuprolide acetate|DRUG: nilutamide|PROCEDURE: orchiectomy|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Overall survival, 10 years","Disease specific survival, 10 years|Time to disease progression, 10 years|Symptomatic local control measured by surgical intervention rate, 10 years|Quality of life assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30 + 3 and a trial-specific checklist (PR17) or the FACT-P questionnaire, 10 years",,NCIC Clinical Trials Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group|SWOG Cancer Research Network|Medical Research Council,MALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,361,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,PR3|CAN-NCIC-PR3|ECOG-JPR03|MRC-PR07|SWOG-JPR3|EU-99013|NCI-T94-0110O|ISRCTN24991896|CDR0000064065,1995-02-08,2011-09-23,2012-01-06,2003-01-27,,2020-04-03,"Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|BCCA - Fraser Valley Cancer Centre, Surrey, British Columbia, V3V 1Z2, Canada|BCCA - Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|QEII Health Sciences Center, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1V7, Canada|Juravinski Cancer Centre at Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 5C2, Canada|Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario at Kingston, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 5P9, Canada|London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, N6A 4L6, Canada|Ottawa Health Research Institute - General Division, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada|Regional Cancer Program of the Hopital Regional, Sudbury, Ontario, P3E 5J1, Canada|Thunder Bay Regional Health Science Centre, Thunder Bay, Ontario, P7B 6V4, Canada|Univ.
