NCT00071799,A Survival Study in Patients With High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes Comparing Azacitidine Versus Conventional Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00071799,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated with azacitidine have improved survival compared to conventional care treatments. The study will also assess the effect of treatments on response, duration of response, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study will continue for 12 months following last patient enrolled.

Patients surviving at the end of the follow-up period were censored at the date of last contact. If a patient withdrew consent to follow-up or was lost to follow-up, the patient was censored as of the last date of contact.
