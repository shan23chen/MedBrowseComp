NCT03151811,A Study of Melphalan Flufenamide (Melflufen)-Dex or Pomalidomide-dex for RRMM Patients Refractory to Lenalidomide,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03151811,OCEAN,TERMINATED,"This was a randomized, controlled, open-label, Phase 3 multicenter study which enrolled patients with RRMM following 2-4 lines of prior therapy and who were refractory to lenalidomide in the last line of therapy as demonstrated by disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last dose of lenalidomide. Patients received either melflufen+dex or pomalidomide+dex.",YES,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Melflufen|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival defined as the duration in months from randomization until first evidence of confirmed disease progression, as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC). Disease progression was defined according to the IMWG-URC as progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization until first evidence of confirmed disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first), up to the data cutoff date of 03 Feb 2021 (ie, assessed up to approximately 43 months).","Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of patients for whom the best overall confirmed response is stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR), as assessed by IRC., From randomization until best response achieved before confirmed disease progression or death due to any cause, up to data cutoff of 03 Feb 2021 (ie, assessed up to approx. 43 months). Median time to best response: Arm A=2.1 months and Arm B=2.0 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as the duration in months from first documentation of a confirmed response to first evidence of confirmed disease progression or death due to any cause., From first documentation of a confirmed response to first evidence of confirmed disease progression or death due to any cause, up to the data cutoff date of 03 Feb 2021 (ie, assessed up to approximately 43 months).|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time in months from randomization to date of death due to any cause. Patients who were still alive at end of study, or lost to follow up, were censored at the last day the patient was known to be alive., From date of randomization until up to 24 months following confirmed disease progression or initiation of subsequent therapy, up to the data cutoff date of 03 Feb 2023 (ie, assessed up to approximately 67 months).|Safety and Tolerability: Number of Patients With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Including Clinical Laboratory and Vital Signs Abnormalities, as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of patients with TEAEs, including clinical laboratory and vital signs abnormalities, as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 are presented. No formal statistical analysis was performed for safety endpoints., From start of dosing until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, up to the data cutoff date of 03 Feb 2023 (ie, assessed up to approximately 67 months). Median duration of study treatment was 25.2 and 22.1 weeks for Arm A and B, respectively.",,Oncopeptides AB,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,495,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,OP-103,2017-06-12,2021-02-03,2023-02-03,2017-05-12,2022-07-27,2024-01-30,"US17, Tucson, Arizona, 85711, United States|US01, Fresno, California, 93710, United States|US11, Gainesville, Florida, 32610, United States|US12, Orange City, Florida, 32763, United States|US-19, Plantation, Florida, 33324, United States|US16, Boise, Idaho, 83712, United States|US-24, Louisville, Kentucky, 40207, United States|US13, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|US-27, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, 39401, United States|US-21, Salisbury, North Carolina, 28144, United States|US-30, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27103, United States|US06, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107, United States|US15, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, 78234, United States|US-18, Temple, Texas, 76504, United States|AT-02, Linz, Austria|AT-01, Vienna, Austria|BE-05, Edegem, Belgium|BE-03, Liège, Belgium|BE-02, Roeselare, Belgium|CZ-05, Brno, Czechia|CZ-03, Hradec Králové, Czechia|CZ-04, Olomouc, Czechia|CZ-01, Ostrava, Czechia|Cz-02, Cz-06, Praha, Czechia|DK01, Vejle, Denmark|EE-01, Tallinn, Estonia|EE-02, Tartu, Estonia|FR04, Brest, France|FR-11, Cholet, France|FR01, Le Mans, France|FR05, Limoges, France|FR-07, Lyon, France|FR06, Lyon, France|FR03, Mulhouse, France|FR-09, Nice, France|FR-08, Poitiers, France|FR-10, Périgueux, France|Gr02, Gr03, Athens, Greece|GR04, Pátra, Greece|GR01, Thessaloníki, Greece|Hu02, Hu03, Hu04, Budapest, Hungary|HU01, Debrecen, Hungary|HU-06, Kaposvár, Hungary|HU-05, Pécs, Hungary|IL03, Jerusalem, Israel|IL01, Nahariya, Israel|IL05, Rehovot, Israel|IL02, Safed, Israel|IL04, Tel Aviv, Israel|IL06, Tel Aviv, Israel|IT07, Bergamo, Italy|IT02, Bologna, Italy|IT08, Brescia, Italy|It03, It09, Milano, Italy|IT06, Modena, Italy|IT04, Piacenza, Italy|IT05, Terni, Italy|IT01, Torino, Italy|KR-06, Busan, Korea, Republic of|KR-05, Daegu, Korea, Republic of|KR-04, Hwasun, Korea, Republic of|Kr-01, Kr-02, Kr-03, Seul, Korea, Republic of|LT-02, Kaunas, Lithuania|LT-01, Vilnius, Lithuania|NL01, Rotterdam, Netherlands|NO01, Oslo, Norway|NO-02, Ålesund, Norway|PL03, Białystok, Poland|PL02, Chorzów, Poland|PL05, Lublin, Poland|PL-08, Olsztyn, Poland|PL07, Poznań, Poland|PL04, Rzeszów, Poland|PL-09, Toruń, Poland|PL06, Łódź, Poland|RO-02, Braşov, Romania|RO-01, Bucharest, Romania|RU-05, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation|RU-04, Izhevsk, Russian Federation|Ru-11, Ru-14, Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation|RU-03, Moscow, Russian Federation|RU-09, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation|RU-10, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation|RU-06, Petrozavodsk, Russian Federation|Ru-01, Ru-02, Ru-08, Ru-12, Ru-14, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation|RU-07, Samara, Russian Federation|RU-13, Syktyvkar, Russian Federation|ES11, Badalona, Spain|Es02, Es13, Es14, Barcelona, Spain|Es01, Es04, Es09, Madrid, Spain|ES-15, Málaga, Spain|Es07, Es12, Pamplona, Spain|ES10, Salamanca, Spain|ES03, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain|ES08, Sevilla, Spain|Es05, Es06, Valencia, Spain|TW-02, Chiayi City, Taiwan|Tw-04, Tw-07, Kaohsiung, Taiwan|TW-03, Taichung, Taiwan|TW-05, Tainan, Taiwan|Tw-01, Tw-06, Taipei, Taiwan|GB03, Liverpool, United Kingdom|GB01, Manchester, United Kingdom|GB02, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom|GB04, Southampton, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/11/NCT03151811/Prot_002.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/11/NCT03151811/SAP_003.pdf"
