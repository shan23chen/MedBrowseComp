NCT00019682,Aldesleukin With or Without Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00019682,,COMPLETED,This randomized phase III trial studies aldesleukin with vaccine therapy to see how well it works compared to aldesleukin alone in treating patients with melanoma that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body. Aldesleukin may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combining aldesleukin with vaccine therapy is more effective than aldesleukin alone in treating melanoma.,YES,Recurrent Melanoma|Stage IIIA Skin Melanoma|Stage IIIB Skin Melanoma|Stage IIIC Skin Melanoma|Stage IV Skin Melanoma,BIOLOGICAL: Aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: gp100 Antigen|DRUG: Montanide ISA 51 VG|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis,"Best Response Rate (Partial Response [PR] + Complete Response [CR]), A complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease for at least 4 weeks. A partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions for at least one month. No new lesions could appear, and none could increase 25% or more., Up to 12 years","Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival was compared between groups by means of Kaplan-Meier curves using the log-rank test to evaluate the significance of the difference between the arms., From the date of randomization until documentation of progression or last follow up, assessed up to 12 years|Change in T-cell Precursors, To measure change in T-cell precursors, PBMC were tested for reactivity by measuring gamma-interferon release after overnight coculture with peptide pulsed T2 cells. PBMC obtained after 4 cycles of study treatment were compared to pre treatment PBMC. A positive assay was defined as greater than 100pg/ml gamma-interferon release and at least twice the release (including all control peptides) by post treatment PBMC compared to pre treatment PBMC., Baseline to up to 12 years|Change in Quality of Life (QOL) Score Assessed by the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General), FACT-F (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Fatigue), SF-36 (Short Form 36) and SDS (Symptom Distress Scale), QOL was measured before and after 2 cycles of treatment using 4 measures: FACT-G is a 27 item measure of QOL. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale and ranges from 0-135, with higher scores indicating better QOL. FACT-F is 13 item measure of fatigue. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale. Total score ranges from 0-52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue. SF-36 is a 36 item measure of self-reported health status. SF-36 is comprised of 8 subscales: physical function, role physical, bodily pain vitality, role emotional function, mental health, social function and general health. Summated scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a better health state. SDS is a 13 item measure of symptom distress. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale. Total score ranges from 13 to 65, with higher scores indicating more symptom distress., Baseline to up to 8 weeks",,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,185,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NCI-2012-02897|NCI-2012-02897|CDR0000066963|99-C-0051|T98-0085,1999-12,2011-05,2011-05,2003-01-27,2017-11-20,2017-11-20,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, United States|Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Riverside, California, 92505, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center - Anschutz Cancer Pavilion, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Lakeland Regional Cancer Center, Lakeland, Florida, 33805, United States|Emory University/Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States|Advocate Lutheran General Hospital., Park Ridge, Illinois, 60068, United States|IU Health Goshen Center for Cancer Care, Goshen, Indiana, 46526, United States|The James Graham Brown Cancer Center at University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, 40202, United States|National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States|Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28203, United States|The Christ Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45219, United States|Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States|Saint Luke's University Hospital-Bethlehem Campus, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, 18015, United States|Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033-0850, United States|M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Aurora Saint Luke's Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53215, United States",
