NCT00861705,Paclitaxel With or Without Carboplatin and/or Bevacizumab Followed by Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00861705,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel with or without carboplatin and/or bevacizumab followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with breast cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving chemotherapy together with bevacizumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.",YES,Male Breast Carcinoma|Stage IIA Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIB Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7|Stage IIIA Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) in the Breast.

The longest diameter (LD) of the target lesion at the time of study initiation will be reported as the baseline LD. The baseline LD of the target lesion will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease. Radiographic complete response: Disappearance of the target lesion. Radiographic partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesion taking as reference the baseline LD., Baseline; at completion of neoadjuvant therapy|Clinical Response Assessed by Tumor Measurement, Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Both target and, in the event of multifocal or multicentric invasive breast cancer, nontarget lesions should be followed clinically and their clinical size recorded at aseline. Measurements thereafter are required at the completion of 12 weeks of paclitaxel or paclitaxel/carboplatin and at the completion of all neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At any time point, these lesions should be categorized regarding whether there is evidence of progression. If ""yes"", the study chair should be notified in order to determine whether the patient should come off protocol treatment.
