NCT00540358,"A Phase 2 Trial of Standard Chemotherapy, With or Without BSI-201, in Patients With Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00540358,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine whether combining iniparib (BSI-201) with standard chemotherapy in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer patients improve clinical benefit compared to treatment with standard chemotherapy alone.

Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it was concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: gemcitabine/carboplatin|DRUG: iniparib,"Clinical benefit rate, Clinical benefit rate was defined as the percentage of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease â‰¥6 months., until cut-off date established so that all patients were evaluable for primary outcome measure","Objective response rate, Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed partial response or complete response, until cut-off date established so that all patients were evaluable for primary outcome measure|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever came first., until cut-off date established so that all patients were evaluable for primary outcome measure",,Sanofi,BiPar Sciences,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,123,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,TCD11485|20070102,2007-10,2009-11,2010-06,2007-10-08,,2012-12-28,"Research Site, Birmingham, Alabama, United States|Research Site, Denver, Colorado, United States|Research Site, Torrington, Connecticut, United States|Research Site, Ocoee, Florida, United States|Research Site, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States|Research Site, Overland Park, Kansas, United States|Research Site, Henderson, Nevada, United States|Research Site, Hooksett, New Hampshire, United States|Research Site, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States|Research Site, Bedford, Texas, United States|Research Site, Dallas, Texas, United States|Research Site, El Paso, Texas, United States|Research Site, Fort Worth, Texas, United States|Research Site, Houston, Texas, United States|Research Site, Tyler, Texas, United States|Research Site, Fairfax, Virginia, United States|Research Site, Vancouver, Washington, United States|Research Site, Yakima, Washington, United States",
