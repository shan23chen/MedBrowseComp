NCT01900743,Phase II Study of Regorafenib in Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01900743,REGO-SARC,COMPLETED,"This is an international (France, Austria and Germany), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with histologically proven metastatic and/or unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) after failure or intolerance to doxorubicin (or other anthracycline).

Five cohorts will be defined:

Cohort A: Liposarcoma Cohort B: Leiomyosarcoma Cohort C: Synovial sarcoma Cohort D: other sarcomas (see Appendix C) Cohort E: Leiomyosarcoma, Synovial sarcoma and other sarcomas listed in Appendix C previously treated with pazopanib Approximately 226 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the treatment groups.",NO,Sarcoma,DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival will be measured from the date of randomization until the date of radiological progression or death (if death occurs before progression).
