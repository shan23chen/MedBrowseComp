NCT03156452,Newly Diagnosed Immune Thrombocytopenia Testing the Standard Steroid Treatment Against Combined Steroid & Mycophenolate,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03156452,FLIGHT,COMPLETED,"This is a study of two treatment pathways \[Standard steroid treatment versus combined steroid and Mycophenolate (MMF)\] for subjects with newly diagnosed Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP is an illness that causes bruising and bleeding due to a low platelet count (blood cells essential for normal clotting). Patients are first given high dose steroids but most suffer side effects (e.g. difficulty sleeping, weight gain, moods swings, high blood pressure and diabetes). In addition, the majority of patients become ill again when the steroids are stopped - only about 20% stay well long term. ITP is relatively rare, non-cancerous in nature and the rare impact on survival of ITP have prevented it from being a priority for research funding, with first line treatment being unsatisfactory and unchallenged for decades. This underestimates the profound adverse impact an ITP diagnosis and its treatment has on individual patients, many of whom are young.

MMF is often used as the next stage treatment for ITP and it works well. However, it can take up to 2 months to work during which patients continue to be at risk of bleeding, bruising, fatigue and usually need more steroids which they find intolerable. They are required to come to hospital for weekly blood tests and for many this impacts on work. We want to find out whether it would benefit more patients if everyone takes MMF at diagnosis instead of current practice (waiting for the illness to come back). We plan to test this by comparing the current way we treat patients to a new way with patients given MMF right at the start of their treatment. 120 patients from 20 different hospitals will be asked to take part and half will be randomly chosen for the new pathway.",NO,Immune Thrombocytopenia,DRUG: Mycophenolate Mofetil|DRUG: Prednisolone,"Time from randomisation to treatment failure., To include patients who are refractory (platelet count \<30x109/L in spite of 2 weeks treatment in the steroid arm or platelet count \<30x109/L in spite of 2 months treatment in the steroid +MMF arm) or who initially respond but then relapse (defined clinically as platelet count \<30x109/L and need for further therapy)., 1 year","Medication side effects, toxicity and other adverse events (including infection episodes), Most participants experience side effects from the medication, data will be collected on treatment side effects and adverse events as assessed by CTCAE V4.0, Up to 12 months post randomisation|Bleeding events, To be analysed as number of bleeding events per patient recorded by 12 months.
