NCT01298713,Tamoxifen-RAD001 Versus Tamoxifen Alone in Patients With Anti-aromatase Resistant Breast Metastatic Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01298713,,COMPLETED,Tamoxifen is a classical treatment for breast metastatic cancer after 3rd generation anti-aromatase hormonotherapy in adjuvant or in metastatic line. The Tamoxifen efficacy is lowered by the hormonoresistance mechanisms due to the primary use of the anti-aromatases. The Pi3K-AKT-mTor pathway is frequently associated to the hormonoresistance mechanisms. This study is aimed to check if the inhibition of this signal transduction pathway by a synthetic mTor inhibitor (Everolimus) could improve the efficacy of the Tamoxifen.,NO,Breast Neoplasms|mTor Protein,DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Everolimus,"Clinical benefit at 24 weeks, 42 months","Partial and complete response per RECIST, 42 months|Qualitative and quantitative toxicities, 24 months|Overall survival, 42 months",,ARCAGY/ GINECO GROUP,Novartis,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,111,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,TAMRAD|EUDRACT 2006-004332-79,2008-03,2011-06,2018-09-12,2011-02-18,,2023-09-06,"Hopital Hotel Dieu, Paris, 75004, France",
