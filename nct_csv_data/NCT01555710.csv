NCT01555710,Study of Palifosfamide-tris in Combination With Carboplatin and Etoposide in Chemotherapy Naïve Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (The MATISSE Study),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01555710,,UNKNOWN,"This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label, adaptive study to evaluate the efficacy of PaCE chemotherapy in chemotherapy naive subjects with extensive-stage SCLC. Eligible subjects will be stratified according to age, gender, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PaCE or CE chemotherapy.

The study design uses an adaptive group sequential approach with sample size re-estimation at the interim analysis.

Secondary efficacy endpoints include ORR, PFS, duration of response and changes in QOL and disease-related symptoms. Tumor-related endpoints will be assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines.

The safety of study treatments will be assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events as determined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03. To provide an initial confirmation of safety, an early interim analysis of safety data only will be performed.

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be convened to assess the safety and efficacy of the study interventions and to monitor the overall conduct of the clinical trial.",NO,Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Palifosfamide-tris|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Carboplatin,"Overall Survival (OS), Assessed every 12 weeks for survival until 1 year following completion of enrollment","Progression Free Survival (PFS), Assessed every 6 weeks for 22 weeks, then every 12 weeks until progressive disease, initiation of alternate anticancer therapy, or 1 year following the last patient enrolled (whichever is soonest)|Quality of Life (QOL) as assessed by EQ-5D-3L and QLQ-LC13, Assessed every 3 weeks for 22 weeks, then every 12 weeks until 1 year following the last patient enrolled|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assessed every 6 weeks for 22 weeks, then every 12 weeks until a partial or complete response is confirmed|Response Duration, Time from the date of first objective response (partial or complete response), with subsequent confirmation, until the date of disease progression or the occurrence of death|Safety parameters (number of adverse events as well as number of findings from physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results)using NCI CTCAE v. 4.03, 22 weeks",,Alaunos Therapeutics,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,548,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IPM3002,2012-05,2015-06,2015-06,2012-03-15,,2013-05-21,"Birmingham Hematology and Oncology Associates, LLC, Birmingham, Alabama, 35205, United States|University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|Redwood Regional Oncology Group, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|Christiana Care Health Services, Newark, Delaware, 19713, United States|Baptist Cancer Institute, Jacksonville, Florida, 32207, United States|Hematology Oncology Associates of the Treasure Coast, Port Sant Lucie, Florida, 34952, United States|Peachtree Hematology Oncology Consultants, Atlanta, Georgia, 30318, United States|Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States|Medical and Surgical Specialists, LLC, Galesburg, Illinois, 61401, United States|Illinois Cancer Specialists, Niles, Illinois, 60714-5905, United States|Central Indiana Cancer Centers, Fishers, Indiana, 46037, United States|Goshen Center for Cancer Care, Goshen, Indiana, 46526, United States|Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|Horizon Oncology Center, Lafayette, Indiana, 47905, United States|Indiana University Health Ball Memorial Hospital, Muncie, Indiana, 47303, United States|University of Kansas Hospital, Overland Park, Kansas, 66210, United States|Central Baptist Hospital, Lexington, Kentucky, 40503, United States|Medical Oncology, LLC, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70809, United States|Frederick Memorial Hospital Regional Cancer Therapy Center, Frederick, Maryland, 21701, United States|Metro Health Cancer Center, Wyoming, Michigan, 49519, United States|Saint Mary's Medical Center, Duluth, Minnesota, 55805, United States|Virginia Piper Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55407, United States|John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, 07601, United States|Hematology Oncology Associates of Northern New Jersey, PA, Carol G.
