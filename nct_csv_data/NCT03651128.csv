NCT03651128,Efficacy and Safety Study of bb2121 Versus Standard Regimens in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03651128,KarMMa-3,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of bb2121 versus standard regimens in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

The study is anticipated to randomize approximately 381 subjects with RRMM.
