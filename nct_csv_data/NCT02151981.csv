NCT02151981,AZD9291 (Osimertinib) Versus Platinum-Based Doublet-Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02151981,AURA3,COMPLETED,"A Phase III, Open Label, Randomized Study of Osimertinib versus Platinum-Based Doublet Chemotherapy for Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours harbour a T790M mutation within the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene",YES,Anticancer Treatment,DRUG: Chemotherapy|DRUG: Cross-over to Osimertinib,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Investigator Assessment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. PFS is the time from date of randomisation until the date of PD (by investigator assessment) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression up to 19 months (at the time of the primary PFS analysis).","Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Investigator Assessment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR prior to progression or any further therapy., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression up to 19 months (at the time of the primary PFS analysis).|Duration of Response (DoR) by Investigator Assessment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. DoR is the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression up to 19 months (at the time of the primary PFS analysis).|Disease Control Rate (DCR) by Investigator Assessment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions; Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a response nor sufficient growth to qualify as progression; Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. DCR is the percentage of patients with best response of CR, PR or SD at \>=6 weeks, prior to any progressive disease (PD)., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression up to 19 months (at the time of the primary PFS analysis).|Tumour Shrinkage by Investigator Assessment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Tumour size was calculated as the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the Target Lesions. Tumour shrinkage is percentage change in tumour size from baseline using RECIST v1.1 tumour response., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression up to 19 months (at the time of the primary PFS analysis).|Secondary: Overall Survival (OS), From date of randomization until time of final OS analysis, a median follow-up of 43 months","Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST), Time from randomisation to first subsequent anti-cancer therapy (FST) following randomised treatment discontinuation, or death if no FST administered. Any patient not known to have died nor received any subsequent anti-cancer therapy (ST) was censored at the last time known not to have received ST, ie, the last follow-up visit this was confirmed., From date of randomisation until time of final OS analysis, a median follow-up of 43 months|Time to Second Subsequent Therapy (TSST), Time from randomisation to second subsequent anti-cancer therapy (SST) following randomised treatment discontinuation, or death if no SST administered.
