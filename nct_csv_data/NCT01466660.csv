NCT01466660,LUX-Lung 7: A Phase IIb Trial of Afatinib(BIBW2992) Versus Gefitinib for the Treatment of 1st Line EGFR Mutation Positive Adenocarcinoma of the Lung,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01466660,,COMPLETED,"This is a randomised, open-label, phase IIb trial of afatinib to compare to gefitinib in first-line treatment setting with patients who are having epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung.",YES,Lung Neoplasms,DRUG: Afatinib|DRUG: gefitinib,"Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of disease progression, or date of death if a patient died earlier. Participants with no event (Disease progression (PD) or death) were censored. PD was primarily evaluated for the primary analysis by an independent central imaging review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Per RECIST version 1.1. for target lesions and assessed by Computed Tomography (CT)-scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): PD, At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SoD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest SoD of target lesions recorded since the treatment started, together with an absolute increase in the SoD of target lesions of at least 5 millimetre (mm) or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For the final analysis (analysis cut-off date 12 April 2019) status and date of PD were determined by investigator assessment., From first drug administration until 28 days after last drug administration + Follow-Up period for collecting information on disease progression or death, up to 2465 days.|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) (Main Overall Survival Analysis Cut-off Date, 08 April 2016), Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) which was the time from the date of randomisation to the date of i.e. permanent treatment discontinuation for any reason., From first drug administration until last drug administration, up to 1482 days|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) which was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death. Participants for whom there is no evidence of death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date that they were last known to be alive., From first drug administration until 28 days after last drug administration + Follow-Up period for collecting information on death, up to 2465 days.","Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) which was defined as the number of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by central independent review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. divided by the total number of participants who received treatment. Per RECIST version 1.1. for target lesions and assessed by Computed Tomography (CT)-scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from baseline. For the final analysis (analysis cut-off date 12 April 2019) objective response was determined by investigator assessment., From first drug administration until 28 days after last drug administration + Follow-Up period for collecting information on disease progression, further anti-cancer treatment and death, up to 2465 days.|Time to Objective Response, Number of participants with objective response (best overall response of complete response or partial response) to study treatment over time, cumulative number of participants is displayed. Time to objective response was defined as the time from randomisation to the first recorded objective response. For the final analysis (analysis cut-off date 12 April 2019) objective response was determined by investigator assessment., From first drug administration until 28 days after last drug administration + Follow-Up period for collecting information on disease progression, further anti-cancer treatment and death, up to 2465 days.|Duration of Objective Response, Duration of objective response defined as the time of first objective response (best overall response of complete response or partial response) to the time of progression or death, whichever occurred first (or date of censoring for progression free survival). For the final analysis (analysis cut-off date 12 April 2019) objective response was determined by investigator assessment., From first drug administration until 28 days after last drug administration + Follow-Up period for collecting information on disease progression, further anti-cancer treatment and death, up to 2465 days.|Disease Control, Percentage of participants with disease control which was defined as the number of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as assessed by central independent review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. divided by the total number of participants who received treatment. Per RECIST version 1.1. for target lesions and assessed by Computed Tomography (CT)-scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from baseline; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Responses of SD were only considered if they occur ≥42 days from date of randomisation. For the final analysis (analysis cut-off date 12 April 2019) disease control was determined by investigator assessment., From first drug administration until 28 days after last drug administration + Follow-Up period for collecting information on disease progression or death, up to 2465 days.|Duration of Disease Control, Duration of disease control defined as the time from randomisation to the time of progression or death, whichever occurred first (or date of censoring for progression free survival). For the final analysis (analysis cut-off date 12 April 2019) the status and date of disease progression were determined by investigator assessment., From first drug administration until 28 days after last drug administration + Follow-Up period for collecting information on disease progression or death, up to 2465 days.|Tumour Shrinkage (Main Overall Survival Analysis Cut-off Date, 08 April 2016), Tumour shrinkage assessed by minimum sum of post-baseline target lesion diameters recorded after randomisation. A positive value shows a decrease in tumour size., From first drug administration until last drug administration, up to 1482 days|Health-related Quality of Life (Primary Analysis Cut-off Date, 21 August 2015), Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured using European Quality of life - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) score for United Kingdom (UK) and Belgium and European European Quality Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS).

EQ-5D utility scores range from 0 (worst health) to 1 (full health).

EQ-VAS scores range from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).

Results display the mean score up to 56 weeks., Every 8 weeks, up to 56 weeks",,Boehringer Ingelheim,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,319,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,1200.123|2011-001814-33,2011-12-13,2016-04-08,2019-04-12,2011-11-08,2017-06-19,2020-04-07,"Chris Obrien Lifehouse, Camperdown, New South Wales, 2050, Australia|St George Hospital, Kogarah, New South Wales, 2217, Australia|The Prince Charles Hospital, Chermside, Queensland, 4032, Australia|Haematology & Oncology Clinics of Australasia (HOCA), South Brisbane, Queensland, 4101, Australia|Box Hill Hospital, Box Hill, Victoria, 3128, Australia|Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, 3084, Australia|Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia, 6009, Australia|Cross Cancer Institute (University of Alberta), Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) - Fraser Valley Cancer, Surrey, British Columbia, V1V 1Z2, Canada|BC Cancer Agency - Vancouver, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|Lakeridge Health Oshawa, Oshawa, Ontario, L1G 2B9, Canada|The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada|Montreal General Hospital - McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, H3G 1A4, Canada|Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, 100021, China|Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing, 100036, China|Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060, China|The Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nan Ning, 530021, China|Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai, 200030, China|Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, Shanghai, 200032, China|The First Hospital of Chinese Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, China|CTR Oncologie du Pays Basque, Onco, Bayonne, Bayonne, 64100, France|CTR François Baclesse, Caen, 14076, France|HOP Intercommunal, Créteil, 94010, France|HOP Michallon, La Tronche, 38700, France|HOP Dupuytren 1, Limoges Cedex, 87042, France|CTR Leon Berard, Lyon, 69373, France|CTR René Gauducheau, Saint Herblain, 44805, France|HOP Sud-Réunion, Pneumo, Saint Pierre, St-Pierre - La Réunion, 97448, France|Ruhrlandklinik, Westdeutsches Lungenzentrum am Universitätsklinikum Essen gGmbH, Essen, 45122, Germany|Klinikum Esslingen GmbH, Esslingen, 73730, Germany|Universitätsmedizin der Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Mainz, 55131, Germany|Queen Mary Hospital, Hongkong, Hong Kong|Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong|Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, D09 Y5R3, Ireland|St James's Hospital, Dublin, 8, Ireland|Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, 361-771, Korea, Republic of|Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon, 405-760, Korea, Republic of|Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 110-744, Korea, Republic of|Severance Hospital, Seoul, 120-752, Korea, Republic of|Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, 135-710, Korea, Republic of|Asan Medical Center, Seoul, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|Oslo Universitetssykehus HF, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, N-0379, Norway|National Cancer Centre, Singapore, 169610, Singapore|Johns Hopkins Singapore International Medical Center, Singapore, 308433, Singapore|Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, 28041, Spain|Hospital Regional Universitario de Málaga, Malaga, 29010, Spain|Hospital Central de Asturias, Oviedo, 33006, Spain|Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, 39008, Spain|Hospital Virgen del Rocío, Sevilla, 41013, Spain|Sahlgrenska US, Göteborg, Göteborg, 413 45, Sweden|Universitetssjukhuset, Linköping, Linköping, 581 85, Sweden|Skånes universitetssjukhus, Lund, Lund, 221 85, Sweden|Karolinska Univ. sjukhuset, Stockholm, 171 76, Sweden|Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, 407, Taiwan|NCKUH, Tainan, 704, Taiwan|National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, 100, Taiwan|Taipe Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, 112, Taiwan|Chang Gung Memorial Hospital(Linkou), Tao-Yuan, 333, Taiwan|Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZN, United Kingdom|Birmingham City Hospital, Birmingham, B18 7QH, United Kingdom|Velindre Cancer Centre, Cardiff, CF14 2TL, United Kingdom|Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, United Kingdom|Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, GU2 7XX, United Kingdom",
