NCT00601900,Tamoxifen Citrate or Letrozole With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Women With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00601900,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies tamoxifen citrate or letrozole together with bevacizumab to see how well it works compared with tamoxifen citrate or letrozole alone in treating women with stage IIIB or stage IV breast cancer. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen citrate or letrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving hormone therapy is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating advanced breast cancer.",YES,Invasive Breast Carcinoma|Recurrent Breast Carcinoma|Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v6|Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7,BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Letrozole|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|DRUG: Tamoxifen Citrate,"Progression-free Survival, The Primary Endpoint for this study was to compare the progression-free survival of letrozole therapy alone with the combination of letrozole therapy plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment in women with estrogen- and/or progesterone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. The median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression was assessed per RECIST criteria, and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions from baseline or the appearance of new lesions., From randomization until disease progression or death whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years","12 Month Progression Free Survival Rate, The 12 month progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients who were alive progression-free 12 months after registration into the study., At 12 months|6 Month Progression-Free Survival Rate, The 6 month progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients who were alive progression-free 6 months after registration into the study., At 6 months|Objective Response Rate, Response was defined using RECIST criteria: Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Assessed up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from study entry to death from any cause. The median OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Assessed up to 5 years|Duration of Tumor Response, Defined by RECIST criteria., From the time measurement criteria are met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, assessed up to 5 years|Probability of Surviving Until 36 Months, At 36 months|Site of Progression, Up to 5 years|Time-to-treatment Failure, From randomization until first disease progression, early termination of protocol therapy due to toxicity or withdrawn consent, or going onto non-protocol therapy.
