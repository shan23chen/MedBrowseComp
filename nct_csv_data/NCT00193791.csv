NCT00193791,Concomitant Chemoradiation in Advanced Stage Carcinoma Cervix,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00193791,CRACx,COMPLETED,"A study to evaluate the efficacy of concomitant chemoradiation as compared to radiotherapy alone. Concomitant chemoradiation is not a new treatment modality for carcinoma cervix. Studies have shown improvement in survivals with chemoradiation, but majority of the patients was in early stages. Since this treatment modality has not been tested adequately in advanced stages in our setting, the present study is being undertaken. The study arm of chemoradiation has the potential to improve the survivals by 10%, but is associated with additional 5% risk of toxicities, which are treatable. In the study arm, apart form the standard radiotherapy treatment, you will receive weekly chemotherapy injections (Cisplatin) during external radiation therapy. The study arm is associated with additional 5% acute hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities, which are treatable with medications, blood transfusions, modifications in the ongoing treatment etc.",NO,Cancer of Cervix,OTHER: CT + RT,"To compare the disease free survivals., December 2009","To compare the overall survivals, December 2010|To compare the distant metastasis rates, December 2010|To compare the quality of life in both the groups, December 2010|To compare the normal tissue toxicities (Acute & Late) of standard radiation therapy with concomitant chemo-radiation., June 2017",,Tata Memorial Hospital,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,850,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,TMH/114/2003/CRACX TRIAL,2003-07-07,2017-05,2017-12,2005-09-19,,2019-09-17,"Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharastra, 400 012, India",
