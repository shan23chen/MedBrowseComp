NCT03875092,A Study of Carboplatin-Paclitaxel/Nab-Paclitaxel Chemotherapy With or Without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Adults With First Line Metastatic Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-407/KEYNOTE-407)-China Extension Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03875092,,COMPLETED,"In this China extension study, carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) will be administered to Chinese adults with first line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The primary hypotheses are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs: 1) Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by a blinded central imaging vendor compared to placebo, and 2) Overall Survival (OS) in Chinese participants.

After analysis of interim results was conducted, the protocol was amended (Amendment 5) to allow participants the option to discontinue placebo in the control arm and to switch to pembrolizumab in the event of documented progressive disease as assessed by central review.",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Saline placebo for pembrolizumab,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of ≥1 new lesions was also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 is presented. Data are from the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 33 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS is presented. Data are from the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 39 months","Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed by RECIST 1.1. ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 33 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), For participants who demonstrated a confirmed response (Complete Response \[CR\]: Disappearance of all target lesions or Partial Response \[PR\]: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 or death. DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 30 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The number of participants who experienced an AE is presented. Data are from the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 31 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 29 months",,Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,125,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",3475-407 China Extension|173568|MK-3475-407|KEYNOTE-407,2017-04-21,2020-09-30,2023-09-14,2019-03-14,2021-10-20,2024-10-01,"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, Shanghai, 200032, China","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/92/NCT03875092/Prot_002.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/92/NCT03875092/SAP_003.pdf"
