NCT01197560,Study of Lenalidomide to Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01197560,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to compare lenalidomide to a control drug and see which one delays Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) disease progression longer.,YES,Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma,DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Etoposide,"Stage 1: Percentage of Participants With an Overall Response According to the International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), Cheson 1999 and Evaluated by the Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC), An overall response is a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu) or partial response (PR) and was evaluated by the IRAC. A CR = complete disappearance of disease and related symptoms. Lymph nodes and nodal masses regressed on computed tomography to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes \> 1.5 cm prior to therapy and ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis for nodes 1.1-1.5 cm in their long axis and \> 1.0 cm in their short axis prior to therapy). Spleen and/or liver not palpable on exam, normal size by imaging, and absence of nodules related to lymphoma. If bone marrow was involved prior to therapy, infiltrate must have cleared on repeat biopsy. PR = ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules regressed by ≥ 50% in their SPD or for single nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter;no new disease., From the date of randomization to the data cut-off of 4 July 2013; when all patients reached the scheduled 16-week assessment or had progressed/died before the scheduled 16-week assessment); the median study duration was 27.0 and 19.7 weeks, respectively.|Stage 1: Percentage of Participants With an Overall Response According to the IWG Response Criteria Based on the Investigators Assessment at the Final Data Cut During the Core Treatment Phase, Response was defined as having a CR, CRu or PR, based on IWG 1999 Response Criteria for NHL as evaluated by the investigators. CR = complete disappearance of disease and disease related symptoms. All lymph nodes and nodal masses regressed on computed tomography to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes \> 1.5 cm prior to therapy and ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis for nodes 1.1-1.5 cm in their long axis and \> 1.0 cm in their short axis prior to therapy). Spleen and/or liver not palpable on physical exam, normal size by imaging, and absence of nodules related to lymphoma. If BM was involved prior to therapy, infiltrate must have cleared on repeat biopsy. PR = ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in the other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules regressed by ≥ 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter. No new disease., From the date of randomization to the final data cut-off date of 18 May 2018; median study duration was 27.0 and 19.7 weeks, respectively.","Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Events (TEAEs) in the Overall Treatment Phase by Initial Treatment Assignment, A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:

* Death;
* Life-threatening event;
* Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
* Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
* Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
* Any other important medical event The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event.The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.03) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death, From first dose of study drug to the final data cut-off date of 18 May 2018; median study duration was 27.0 and 19.7 weeks, respectively.|Stage 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as: Complete Response + Complete Response unconfirmed + Partial Response based on the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria \[IWRC\] (Cheson 1999)., Approximately 3.5 years|Stage 2: Duration of Response (DoR), Length of time of overall response (Complete Response + Complete Response unconfirmed + Partial Response) based on the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria \[IWRC\] (Cheson 1999)., Approximately 3.5 years|Stage 2: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as time from randomization until death of any cause., Approximately 3.5 years|Stage 2: Duration of Complete Response, Length of time of complete response (Complete Response + Complete Response unconfirmed) based on the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria \[IWRC\] (Cheson 1999)., Approximately 3.5 years|Stage 2: Overall Response Rate for With a Duration of Response Lasting ≥ 16 Weeks, Complete Response + Complete Response unconfirmed + Partial Response for participants with a duration of response lasting ≥ 16 weeks based on the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria \[IWRC\] (Cheson 1999)., Approximately 3.5 years|Stage 2: Time to Progression, Length of time until disease progression occurs, Approximately 3.5 years|Stage 2: Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaires, Quality of Life based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and the EQ-5D assessments, Approximately 3.5 years","Stage 1: Percentage of Participants With a Durable Overall Response (dORR) According to the IWG Response Criteria as Assessed by the Investigators at the Final Data Cut During the Core Treatment Phase, Durable overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who maintained a response for at least 16 weeks after initial response., From the date of randomization to the final data cut-off date of 18 May 2018; median study duration was 27.0 and 19.7 weeks, respectively.|Stage 1: Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response According to the IWG Response Criteria as Assessed by the Investigators at the Final Data Cut During the Core Treatment Phase, A complete response was defined as participants with a complete response (CR), or unconfirmed complete response (CRu) based on IWG 1999 Response Criteria for NHL as assessed by the investigator. A CR is a complete disappearance of all disease with the exception of nodes. No new lesions. Previously enlarged organs must have regressed and not be palpable. Bone marrow must be negative if positive at baseline. Normalization of markers.
