NCT01282463,"Study of Ramucirumab or Icrucumab (IMC-18F1) With Docetaxel or Docetaxel Alone as Second-Line Therapy in Participants With Bladder,Urethra, Ureter, or Renal Pelvis Carcinoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01282463,,COMPLETED,"This multicenter trial will enroll participants with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis who have had disease progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Participants will be enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment arms: docetaxel; docetaxel and ramucirumab; or docetaxel and icrucumab.",YES,Carcinoma of Urinary Tract|Urethral Carcinoma|Carcinoma of Ureter|Carcinoma of Renal Pelvis,DRUG: Docetaxel|BIOLOGICAL: Ramucirumab DP|BIOLOGICAL: Icrucumab,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS time was the time from randomization until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the 20% relative increase, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions was also considered progression. Participants without objectively determined PD who were alive at the end of the follow-up period (or lost to follow-up) were censored on the date of the participant's last complete radiographic tumor assessment; if no baseline or post-baseline radiologic assessment was available, the participant was censored at the date of randomization., Randomization to Measured PD or Death From Any Cause (Up To 40 Months)","Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response Rate (ORR), Participants achieved an objective response if they had a best overall response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). According to RECIST v1.1, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter; CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to \<10 mm, the disappearance of all nontarget lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels \[if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal (ULN)\]. The percentage of participants who achieved an objective response=(number of participants with CR or PR)/(number of participants assessed)\*100., Randomization to Measured PD (Up to 40 Months)|Duration of Response, The duration of response was measured from the time measurement criteria were first met for a CR or PR (whichever was first recorded) until the first date of objectively documented progressive disease (taking as a reference for progressive disease the smallest measurement recorded since randomization) or the date of death, whichever occurred first. Data for participants who did not relapse or die were censored at the day of their last adequate tumor assessment. Duration of response was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., First Criteria Met for CR or PR to Measured PD or Death From Any Cause (Up to 40 Months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), A summary of other nonserious AEs, and all SAE's, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Up To 41.7 Months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Maximum Concentration (Cmax) Ramucirumab, Cycle 1:Predose,1 hour(hr) post End of Infusion (EOI),48hr,72hr,168hr,336hr post-EOI;Cycle2:Predose,1hr post-EOI; Cycle3:Predose,1hr,48hr,72hr,168hr,336hr post-EOI; Cycle4:Predose,1hr post-EOI;Cycle6 and every other cycle thereafter:Predose,1hr Post EOI|PK: Minimum Concentration (Cmin) Ramucirumab, Cycle 2:Predose,1hr post-EOI;Cycle3:Predose,1hr,48hr,72hr,168hr,336hr, post-EOI;Cycle4:Predose,1hr post-EOI;Cycle6:Predose,1hr Post EOI|PK: Cmax Icrucumab, Cycle 1:Predose,1 hr post-EOI, 48hr, 72hr Post-EOI; Cycle 3:Predose,EOI,1.5hr,24hr,48hr,72hr,168hr Post EOI|PK: Cmin Icrucumab, Cycle 2:Predose,1hr post-EOI;Cycle 3:Predose,EOI,1.5hr,24hr,48hr,72hr,168hr Post EOI|Number of Participants With Serum Anti-Ramucirumab Antibody Assessment, Number of participants with at least one positive titer treatment emergent antibody positive neutralizing antibody detecting.
