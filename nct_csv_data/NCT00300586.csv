NCT00300586,IFCT-GFPC 05.02 A Randomized Phase III Trial Assessing in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00300586,,COMPLETED,"The objective of this trial is to improve the duration of control disease for PS 0-1 patients who are not progressing on first-line cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy. Standard therapy is for these patients to stop first-line chemotherapy after 4 to 6 cycles and to begin a second-line chemotherapy when progression of disease is occurring. Two approaches will be experimented in this trial in attempt to prolong progression free survival :

* Maintenance chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine continued till disease progression or toxicity.
* Sequential treatment with erlotinib immediately given after the end of first-line chemotherapy.",NO,Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: observation|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: erlotinib,"Progression free survival since randomization, time until progression","Overall survival,, no time limit|toxicity (NCIC-CTC 3.0),, time until progression|quality of life (as assessed by LCSS)., until progression",,Hospices Civils de Lyon,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,842,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2005.386,2006-06,2011-03,2011-03,2006-03-09,,2019-05-28,"Maurice PEROL, Lyon, 69317, France",
