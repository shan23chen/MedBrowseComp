NCT01151423,Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Anti-von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Nanobody in Patients With Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (aTTP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01151423,TITAN,COMPLETED,"This study was a Phase II, single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether anti-vWF Nanobody is safe and effective as adjunctive treatment in patients with aTTP.

Patients received either placebo or anti-vWF Nanobody as adjunctive therapy to plasma exchange (PE).",YES,Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,BIOLOGICAL: Caplacizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo,"Time-to-response of Treatment Defined by a Confirmed Recovery of Platelets ≥ 150,000/µL, Time-to-response, defined by the achievement of platelet count response, confirmed at 48 hours after the initial reporting of this response. Platelet response was defined as recovery of platelets ≥ 150,000/µL.

This response had to be confirmed at 48 hours after the initial reporting of platelet recovery ≥ 150,000/µL by a de novo measure of platelets ≥ 150,000/µL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≤ 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) (i.e., 'confirmed platelet response')., From the day of first study drug administration up to 30 days after first study drug administration","Number and Percentage of Subjects With Complete Remission Following Initial Daily Plasma Exchange (PE), Number and percentage of subjects with complete remission (defined as confirmed platelet count response and absence of exacerbation) following initial daily PE., From the day of first study drug administration up to 30 days after first study drug administration|Number and Percentage of Subjects With Exacerbations of TTP, Number and percentage of subjects with exacerbations of TTP (defined as recurrent thrombocytopenia following a confirmed platelet count response and requiring a re-initiation of daily PE treatment after ≥ 1 day but ≤ 30 days of end of daily PE treatment.

Time to first exacerbation of TTP was also examined as part of this end point analysis; the median time to first exacerbation could not be determined because of the small number of events., Within 30 days of last day of initial daily PE|Number and Percentage of Subjects With Relapse of TTP, Number and percentage of subjects with relapse of TTP (defined as de novo TTP event that occurred later than 30 days after the last daily PE) was evaluated., Later than 30 days after the last daily PE|Number of Daily PE Sessions During the Initial Daily PE Period, Number of daily PE sessions during the initial daily PE period which could include more than 1 PE per day was evaluated., During the initial daily PE period, with a median (min, max) duration of exposure to study drug of 6 (2, 36) days|Total Volume of Plasma Administered During the Initial Daily PE Period, The total volume of plasma administered during the initial daily PE period was measured., During the initial daily PE period, with a median (min, max) duration of exposure to study drug of 6 (2, 36) days|Number of Days With at Least One PE Administration During the Total Course of the Study, Number of days for PE was evaluated. This implies the number of days with at least one PE administration during the total course of the study., During the total course of the study (from Screening till the 12-month follow-up [FU] visit)|The Maximum Number of Consecutive Days Per Subject Where There Was no Interruption of PE During the Initial Daily PE Period, The maximum number of consecutive days per subject where there was no interruption of PE during the initial daily PE period., During the initial daily PE period, with a median (min, max) duration of exposure to study drug of 6 (2, 36) days|Resolution of Non-focal Neurological Symptoms, Resolution of non-focal neurological symptoms as defined by neurocognitive function at complete remission, measured by a Computerised Neuropsychological Test Battery(CNTB) (adults only). The CNTB included 6 modules: word list learning and selective reminding (WLL/SR), choice reaction time (CRT), visual memory (VMEM), simple reaction time (SRT), working memory (WMEM), and word list learning and delayed recall (WLL/DR). The 6 tasks are rated as a percentage correct (for CRT and SRT, the percentage correct corresponds to the percentage hits) and the mean score from these provides the CNTB summary score (range: 0-100). A higher CNTB summary score indicates better neuropsychological functioning., From Baseline till the 12-month FU visit|Number of Participants With Resolution of TTP-related Signs or Symptoms, Resolution or improvement (improvement of ≥ 1 grade in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] v4.0 scale) of TTP-related signs and symptoms as captured on physical examination and as adverse events. This endpoint was only evaluated for ""resolution""., End of daily PE treatment period (median [min, max] duration of exposure to study drug of 6 [2, 36] days), end of study treatment period (median [min, max] duration of exposure to study drug of 36.5 [2, 90] days) and at 1 month follow-up|Mortality, Total mortality up to 1 month follow-up., From the start of the study up to 1 month follow-up|Number of PE Related Adverse Events, Number of PE treatment-related adverse events (AEs)., From the start of the study up to 1 month follow-up|Number and Percentage of Subjects With PE Related AEs, Number and percentage of subjects with PE related AEs., From the start of the study up to 1 month follow-up|Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Severity, Number and severity of TEAEs were evaluated.
