NCT00452530,Study of an Investigational Drug for the Prevention of Thrombosis-related Events Following Knee Replacement Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00452530,ADVANCE-2,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to learn whether apixaban prevents the development of blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and lung (pulmonary embolism), which sometimes occur after knee replacement surgery, and to compare the efficacy of apixaban with that of enoxaparin (Lovenox®) in the prevention of these clots. The safety of apixaban will also be studied.",YES,Deep Vein Thrombosis|Pulmonary Embolism,DRUG: Enoxaparin|DRUG: Apixaban|DRUG: Enoxaparin-matching placebo|DRUG: Apixaban-matching placebo,"Rate of Adjudicated Venous Thromboembolic Event-related and All-cause Deaths With Onset During the Intended-treatment Period, Event rate=Number of events divided by the number of patients evaluated. Intended treatment period starts on the day of randomization, and for those who received study drug, ends at the later of 2 days after last dose or 14 days after the first dose of study drug; for randomized patients who did not receive study drug, the period ends 14 days after randomization.Venous thromboembolic event (VTE)=nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or asymptomatic proximal DVT detected by ultrasound.

Adjusted difference of event rates takes into consideration type of surgery as a stratification factor. Bleeding Criteria: Major bleeding=an event consisting of clinically overt bleeding accompanied by a decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more and/or a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells; bleeding that occurred in at least 1 of the following critical sites: intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and retroperitoneal; bleeding that was fatal. CRNM bleeding= clinically overt bleeding; that satisfies none of the additional criteria required for the event to be adjudicated as a major bleeding event; that led to either hospital admission for bleeding, physician-guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding; or a change in antithrombic treatment., Days 1 to 12|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Bleeding Adverse Events (AEs), Discontinuations Due to AEs, and Death as Outcome, AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Bleeding AEs=all serious or nonserious bleeding-related AEs., Days 1 through 12 + 2 days (nonserious AEs, bleeding AES) or 30 days (SAES, deaths) after last dose of study drug","Summary of Laboratory Marked Abnormalities on Hematology and Liver and Kidney Function Test Results During the Treatment Period (Patients With Available Measurements), preRX=pretreatment; LLN=lower limit of normal; ULN=upper limit of normal; abs=absolute.
