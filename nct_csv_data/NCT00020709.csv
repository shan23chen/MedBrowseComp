NCT00020709,Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy With or Without Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00020709,,COMPLETED,Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy with or without gefitinib in treating unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of tumors. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is more effective with or without gefitinib in treating non-small cell lung cancer,NO,Adenocarcinoma of the Lung|Bronchoalveolar Cell Lung Cancer|Large Cell Lung Cancer|Squamous Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: gefitinib|RADIATION: radiation therapy|OTHER: placebo,"Overall Survival, From date of registration to date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 10 years|Progression-free survival, From date of registration to date of first observation of progressive disease, death due to any cause, assessed up to 10 years",,,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,840,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",NCI-2012-03041|S0023|U10CA032102|CDR0000068706,2001-06,2007-02,,2003-01-27,,2013-02-27,"Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Research Base, San Antonio, Texas, 78245, United States",
