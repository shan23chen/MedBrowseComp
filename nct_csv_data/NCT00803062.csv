NCT00803062,"Paclitaxel and Cisplatin or Topotecan With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage IVB, Recurrent, or Persistent Cervical Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00803062,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase III trial studies the side effects of paclitaxel when given together with cisplatin or topotecan with or without bevacizumab and to compare how well they work in treating patients with stage IVB, cervical cancer that has come back or is persistent. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective when given together with cisplatin or topotecan with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with cervical cancer.",YES,Cervical Adenocarcinoma|Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma|Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Recurrent Cervical Carcinoma|Stage IVB Cervical Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Paclitaxel|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|DRUG: Topotecan Hydrochloride,"Overall Survival, The observed length of life from randomization into the study to death or the date of last contact., From entry into the study to death or the date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years|Progression-free Survival, Disease that can be assessed clinically (physical examination) should be evaluated every cycle (every 3 weeks). Disease assessed by imaging modalities (CXR, CT, MRI) should be evaluated every other cycle unless other evidence of a change mandates earlier assessment. Tumor measurements should also be done after the final cycle (if the patient is taken off of study therapy for a reason other than progression) and then every 3 months x 2 years (followed with every 6 months x 3 years) until progression is documented. ""Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions assessed radiographically and 50% increase if the only target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, or unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions"", or similar definition as accurate and appropriate., From study entry until disease progression, death or date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years (During treatment: every 3 weeks if by physical exam, every 6 weeks by CXR, CT or MRI.

If the only target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% increase in longest diameter is required; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Every cycle (if assessed by physical exam), every other cycle (if assessed by imaging), after the final cycle, then every 3 months x 2 years, then every 6 months x 3 years up to 5 years.|To Determine and Compare the Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE Version 3.0 for the Regimens Administered on This Study., The number of patients on each arm who have Grade 3 AE or higher toxicity., From date of enrollment until 30 days after treatment completion",,"Extent of Nicotine Dependence, Assessed from answers the patients provide to a questionnaire.
