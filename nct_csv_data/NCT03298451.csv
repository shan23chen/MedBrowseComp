NCT03298451,Study of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab as First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03298451,HIMALAYA,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global, Phase III study to assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination therapy and durvalumab monotherapy versus sorafenib in the treatment of patients with no prior systemic therapy for unresectable HCC. The patients cannot be eligible for locoregional therapy",YES,Hepatocellular Carcinoma,DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab (Regimen 1)|DRUG: Tremelimumab (Regimen 2)|DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Durvalumab (Regimen 1)|DRUG: Durvalumab (Regimen 2),"Overall Survival (OS) - Treme 300 mg x1 Dose + Durva 1500 mg vs Sora 400 mg, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anticancer therapy. Any participant not known to have died at the DCO date was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive. If the last known date alive or if the date of death was after the DCO date, participants were censored at the DCO date. This primary outcome measure presents OS analysis of Treme 300mg x1 dose + Durva 1500 mg vs Sora 400 mg at the time of the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021)., From the date of randomization until death due to any cause, assessed up to the data cut-off date (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months).","Overall Survival (OS) - Durva 1500 mg vs Sora 400 mg, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anticancer therapy. Any participant not known to have died at the DCO date was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive. If the last known date alive or if the date of death was after the DCO date, participants were censored at the DCO date. This secondary outcome measure presents OS analysis of Durva 1500 mg vs Sora 400 mg at the time of the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021)., From the date of randomization until death due to any cause, assessed up to the data cut-off date (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months).|Overall Survival (OS) at 18, 24, and 36 Months After Randomization, Percentage of participants who were alive at fixed time points (18, 24, and 36 months) after randomization. The estimated percentage of survival along with the 95% confidence interval were calculated using Kaplan-Meier technique on the full analysis set., At 18, 24, and 36 months post-randomization. Assessed at the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021).|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 \[RECIST 1.1\] using Investigator assessments) was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression, regardless of whether the patient withdrew from study treatment or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Progression (i.e., PD) was defined as a at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the smallest previous sum of diameters (nadir) - this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm from nadir., Tumor scans performed at baseline, every 8 weeks for the first 48 weeks following randomization, and every 12 weeks thereafter until RECIST 1.1-defined progression. Assessed up to DCO (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months)|Time To Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression in the absence of death. If participants died without tumor progression, they were censored at the time of death., From the date of randomization until objective tumor progression, assessed until the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months).|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator) was defined as the number (%) of participants with at least 1 confirmed visit response of CR or PR until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression. Participants who go off treatment without progression, receive a subsequent therapy, and then respond will not be included as responders in the ORR. Complete response (ie., CR) was defined as disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis diameter to \<10 mm. Partial response (ie., PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., From the date of randomization until objective tumor progression, assessed until the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months).|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Number (%) of participants with a Best Objective Response (BoR) of CR, PR, or SD. Complete response (ie., CR) was defined as disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis diameter to \<10 mm. Partial response (ie., PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Stable disease (ie., SD) was defined as neither sufficient decrease in sum of diameters to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progression., From the date of randomization until objective tumor progression or date of death, assessed until the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months).|Duration of Objective Response (DoR), Time from the date of first documented confirmed response (complete or partial response) until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. Complete response (ie., CR) was defined as disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis diameter to \<10 mm. Partial response (ie., PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., From the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death, assessed until the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months).|Overall Survival (OS) by PD-L1, Overall survival by baseline PD-L1 expression levels (positive vs. negative). PD-L1 expression level is based on the Tumor and Immune Cell Positivity (TIP) score method as: PD-L1 Positive (TIP ≥ 1%) or PD-L1 Negative (TIP \< 1%)., From the date of randomization until death due to any cause, assessed until the final analysis DCO (27Aug2021, to a maximum of approximately 46 months).|EORTC QLQ-C30 Time to Global Health Status/QoL Deterioration, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30-item core quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30), which consists of 30 questions combined to produce a global health status/QoL scale. Higher scores indicate better health. A clinically meaningful deterioration is defined as a decrease in the score from baseline of ≥10.
