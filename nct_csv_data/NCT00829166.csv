NCT00829166,A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine Versus Capecitabine + Lapatinib in Participants With HER2-positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00829166,EMILIA,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, international, 2-arm, open-label clinical trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with that of capecitabine + lapatinib in participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants will be treated until disease progression (PD), unmanageable toxicity, or study termination. Once disease progression is reported, all participants will be followed for survival every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: Trastuzumab emtansine|DRUG: Lapatinib|DRUG: Capecitabine,"Percentage of Participants With PD or Death as Assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), PD was assessed by an IRC using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as target lesions (TLs) and recorded at baseline. TLs should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements either by imaging or clinically. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline sum longest diameter (SLD). All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-TLs and recorded at baseline. PD for TLs was defined as greater than or equal to (\>/=) 20 percent (%) increase in SLD, taking as reference smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PD for non-TLs was defined as appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Percentage of Participants with PD by IRC or death from any cause was reported., From the date of randomization through the data cut-off date of 14 Jan 2012 (up to 2 years, 11 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by an IRC (Co-primary Endpoint), Tumor response was assessed by an IRC according to modified RECIST.

OR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as TLs and recorded at baseline. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline SLD.
