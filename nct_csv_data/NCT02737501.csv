NCT02737501,ALTA-1L Study: A Study of Brigatinib Versus Crizotinib in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Positive (ALK+) Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Participants,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02737501,ALTA-1L,COMPLETED,"The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of brigatinib to that of crizotinib in ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) participants naive to ALK inhibitors, as evidenced by progression-free survival (PFS).",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Lung Cancer|Advanced Malignancies|Carcinoma,DRUG: Brigatinib|DRUG: Crizotinib,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS as assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the date of the first documented PD event. The data was censored for participants without a PFS event., Up to end of study (Up to 56 months)","Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as percentage of participants who achieved Complete response (CR) or Partial responses (PR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v). 1.1 criteria. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to less than (\<) 10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in SLD of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters., Baseline up to end of treatment (Up to 36 months)|Confirmed Intracranial ORR (iORR), ORR was defined as percentage of participants who achieved CR or PR in the central nervous system (CNS) in randomized participants with intracranial CNS metastasis at baseline. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Baseline up to end of treatment (Up to 36 months)|Intracranial Progression Free Survival, Intracranial PFS as assessed by BIRC, is defined as the time from randomization until first CNS PD is documented, or death due to any cause. PD is SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Baseline up to end of study (Up to 56 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause., Baseline up to end of study (Up to 56 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response as assessed by BIRC, is defined as the time interval from the date that the criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30 % decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD is SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and for non-target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Baseline up to end of study (Up to 56 months)|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response as assessed by BIRC, assessment and is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the initial observation of CR or PR. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Baseline up to end of treatment (Up to 36 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control as assessed by BIRC, defined as percentage of randomized participants who have achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) after randomization. CR defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in SLD of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. PD: SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study, SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Baseline up to end of treatment (Up to 36 months)|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug (i.e., occurs after the first dose of study drug) is also an AE. TEAEs are defined as AEs starting/worsening on or after the first dose of study treatment and no later than the earliest of 30 days after the last dose of the treatment to which the participant was assigned, or the day before start of brigatinib therapy in crossover participant., From first dose up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 37 months)|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life as Assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0), HRQoL: perceived quality of participant's life, includes self-reported multidimensional measures of physical and mental health. Patient-reported symptoms (PROs) and HRQoL will be collected by administering the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life (QLQ)-C30 questionnaire. EORTC-QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. The 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into overall score ranging from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate better QOL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline and Month 36",,Ariad Pharmaceuticals,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,275,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AP26113-13-301|U1111-1210-4363|2015-003447-19,2016-05-26,2020-07-28,2021-01-29,2016-04-14,2021-08-20,2021-08-20,"USOR - Arizona Oncology Associates - Sedona, Sedona, Arizona, 86336, United States|Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Offices, Bellflower, California, 90706, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers - Boulder, Boulder, Colorado, 80303-1385, United States|Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Deerfield Beach, Florida, 33442, United States|Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|West Michigan Cancer Center, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 49007, United States|Minnesota Oncology, Coon Rapids, Minnesota, 55433, United States|Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, 10461, United States|Oncology Hematology Care - Blue Ash, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45242-5665, United States|Stephenson Cancer Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73104, United States|Virginia Cancer Specialists - Fairfax Office, Fairfax, Virginia, 22031, United States|Saint George Hospital, Kogarah, New South Wales, 2217, Australia|Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales, 2065, Australia|Monash Medical Centre, Bentleigh East, Victoria, 3165, Australia|Saint Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Fitzroy, Victoria, 3065, Australia|Universitatsklinium St. Polten, Sankt Polten, Lower Austria, 3100, Austria|Otto-Wagner-Spital Baumgartner Hohe, Vienna, 1140, Austria|Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Odense University Hospital, Odense C, 5000, Denmark|Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer Francois Baclesse, CAEN Cedex 5, Basse-normandie, 14076, France|Hopital Charles Nicolle, Rouen, Haute-normandie, 76041, France|Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil, Ile-de-france, 94010, France|Hopital Tenon, Paris, Ile-de-france, 75020, France|Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Hopital Nord, Marseille Cedex 20, Provence Alpes COTE D'azur, 13915, France|Hopital Albert Michallon, Grenoble Cedex 9, Rhone-alpes, 38043, France|Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, Rhone-alpes, 69008, France|Universitatsklinik Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-wuerttemberg, 79106, Germany|Thoraxklinik Heidelberg gGmbH, Heidelberg, Baden-wuerttemberg, 69126, Germany|Pius Hospital Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Niedersachsen, 26121, Germany|Kliniken der Stadt Koeln gGmbH - Krankenhaus Merheim, Koln, Nordrhein-westfalen, 51109, Germany|Evangelische Lungenklinik Berlin, Berlin, 13125, Germany|Studiengesellschaft Haemato-Onkologie Hamburg Prof. Laack und Partner, Hamburg, 20251, Germany|Tuen Mun Hospital, Tuen Mun, New Territories, Hong Kong|Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kowloon, 150001, Hong Kong|Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Meldola, Forli-cesena, 47014, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliera San Gerardo di Monza, Monza, Monza E Brianza, 20052, Italy|Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano, Aviano, Pordenone, 33081, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliera San Giuseppe Moscati, Avellino, 83100, Italy|Istituto Oncologico di Bari Giovanni Paolo II, Bari, 70124, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria di Bologna Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, 40138, Italy|Istituto Scientifico Universitario San Raffaele, Milano, 20132, Italy|Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milano, 20141, Italy|Istituto Tumori Napoli Fondazione G.
