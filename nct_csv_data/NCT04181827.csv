If the participant is alive or the vital status is unknown, then the participant's data will be censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a partial response (PR) or better according to the IMWG criteria., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Time to Worsening of Symptoms, Time to worsening of symptoms is measured as the interval from the date of randomization to the start date of worsening in the Multiple Myeloma Symptom and Impact Questionnaire (MySIm-Q) total symptom score. The MySIm-Q is a disease-specific PRO assessment complementary to the EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 17 items resulting in a symptom subscale and an impact subscale. The recall period is the ""past 7 days"" and responses are reported on a 5 point verbal rating scale., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Progression Free Survival on next-line therapy (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and date of event, which is defined as progressive disease as assessed by investigator that starts after the next line of subsequent therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence and severity of AEs will be reported., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Systemic Cytokine Concentrations, Serum or plasma proteomic profiling of cytokines (such as interleukin \[IL\] 6, IL-15, and IL 10) concentrations will be measured for biomarker assessment., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Levels of CAR-T Cell Activation Markers, CAR-T cell activation markers including, but not limited to, CD4+, CD8+, CD25+, central memory, effector memory cells will be reported. An evaluation of cell populations may be performed by flow cytometry or cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) or both and correlated with response., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Levels of JNJ-68284528 T Cell Expansion (proliferation), and Persistence, Levels of JNJ-68284528 T cell expansion (proliferation), and persistence via monitoring CAR-T positive cell counts and CAR transgene level will be reported., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Number of Participants with Anti-JNJ-68284528 Antibodies, Number of participants exhibiting anti-drug antibodies for JNJ-68284528 will be reported., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) Scale Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30 items in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single symptom items. The responses are reported using a verbal rating scale. The item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score represents greater HRQoL, better functioning, and more (worse) symptoms., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by MySIm-Q Scale Sore, The MySIm-Q is a disease-specific PRO assessment complementary to the EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 17 items resulting in a symptom subscale and an impact subscale. The recall period is the ""past 7 days"" and responses are reported on a 5 point verbal rating scale., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Scale Score, The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating ""health today"" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by Patient Global Impression of Symptom Severity (PGIS) Scale Score, The PGIS is a single item to assess the participant's perception in the severity of their overall health status using a 5-point verbal rating scale. Score ranges from 1 (None) to 5 (Very Severe)., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)|Frequency in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by The Patient-reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) Item, Frequency distributions of the PRO-CTCAE is an item library of common adverse events experienced by people with cancer that are appropriate for self-reporting. Each symptom selected for inclusion can be rated by up to 3 attributes characterizing the presence/frequency, severity, and/or interference of the adverse event. A 5-point verbal rating scale is used for participants to select their experience based on the last 7 days., Until end of the study (up to 6 years)",,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,419,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CR108695|2019-001413-16|68284528MMY3002,2020-06-12,2024-05-01,2027-06-30,2019-12-02,,2025-03-25,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, United States|Mayo Clinic Cancer Center-Scottsdale, Phoenix, Arizona, 85054, United States|Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California, 94305-5623, United States|Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, United States|University Of Miami Leonard M Mille School Of Medicine SCCC, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States|University of Kansas, Westwood, Kansas, 66205, United States|University Of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201, United States|Mayo Clinic - Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Washington University School Of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, 07601, United States|Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10065, United States|University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, 14642, United States|Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States|Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84112, United States|Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, Madison, Wisconsin, 53705, United States|Medical College Of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States|Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, 5000, Australia|Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, 2050, Australia|Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital, Herston, 4029, Australia|Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, 3000, Australia|Alfred Health, Melbourne, 3004, Australia|Fiona Stanley Hospital, Murdoch, 6150, Australia|Universitair Ziekenhuis - Antwerpen, Antwerp, 2650, Belgium|UZ Gent, Gent, 9000, Belgium|UZ Leuven, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Liege Domaine Universitaire du Sart Tilman, Liege, B-4000, Belgium|Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, 2100, Denmark|CHRU de Lille Hopital Claude Huriez, LILLE Cedex, 59037, France|CHU de Montpellier Hopital Saint Eloi, Montpellier, 34295, France|C.H.U.
