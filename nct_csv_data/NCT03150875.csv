NCT03150875,A Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety Between IBI308 and Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03150875,,COMPLETED,"Clinical trial results demonstrate that anti-PD-1 antibodies prolonged OS to approximately 9 months compared with 6 months in docetaxel group. Anti-PD-1 therapy in Chinese squamous NSCLC patients will be investigated in this clinical trial.

Additionally, the correlation between PD-L1 expression and the response to IBI308 treatment in Chinese squamous cell NSCLC patients as well as the role of irRECIST in immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment evaluation will also be assessed",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: IBI308|DRUG: Docetaxel,"Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Through database cutoff date of 31-July-2020 (up to approximately 35 months)","Progression-free Survival by Investigators' Assessment, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. PFS as assessed by investigators per RECIST 1.1 was reported for each arm., Through database cutoff date of 31-July-2020 (up to approximately 35 months)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Investigators, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented., Through database cutoff date of 31-July-2020 (up to approximately 35 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Investigators, For participants who demonstrated a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until PD or death. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was to be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions or unequivoval progression of non-target lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The DOR per RECIST 1.1 for all participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented., Through database cutoff date of 31-July-2020 (up to approximately 35 months)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), TEAE is any AE that developed or worsened in severity compared to the baseline during the period from first dose of any study treatment up to 90 days after the last dose of any study treatment. Percentage of participants experiencing TEAE is calculated., Through database cutoff date of 31-July-2020 (up to approximately 35 months)",,Innovent Biologics (Suzhou) Co.
