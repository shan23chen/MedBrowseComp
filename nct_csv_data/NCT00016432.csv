NCT00016432,"Exemestane in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Resected Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Breast Cancer Who Have Completed 5 Years of Tamoxifen",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00016432,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using exemestane may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen by the tumor cells. It is not yet known whether exemestane is effective in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer.
