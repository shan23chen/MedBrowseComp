NCT00370331,RAISE: Randomized Placebo-Controlled Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Study With Eltrombopag,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00370331,RAISE,COMPLETED,"The rationale for this Phase III study is to evaluate the 6 month safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in the treatment of previously treated subjects with chronic ITP. The starting dose of eltrombopag, 50 mg, once daily was selected based upon the observed efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics in a dose-finding Study (TRA100773). This Phase III study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study, to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of eltrombopag, initially administered as 50 mg oral tablets once daily for six months in adult subjects with previously treated chronic ITP. Subjects will be randomized 2:1, eltrombopag to placebo, and will be stratified based upon splenectomy status, use of ITP medication at baseline and baseline platelet count less than or equal to 15,000/µL. Subjects will receive study medication for 6 months, during which the dose of study medication may be adjusted based upon individual platelet counts. In addition, subjects may taper off concomitant ITP medications and may receive any rescue treatments as dictated by local standard of care. After discontinuation of study medication, subjects will complete follow-up visits at weeks 1, 2, 4 and months 3 and 6.",YES,"Purpura, Thrombocytopaenic, Idiopathic",DRUG: eltrombopag|DRUG: Placebo,"Percentage of Responders, The percentage of evaluable participants who achieved a platelet response (defined as a platelet count between 50,000 and 400,000 microliter) at each nominal on-therapy day and 4 weeks post-treatment, Baseline; each on-therapy treatment day; Weeks 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26; and Weeks 1, 2, and 4 post-treatment","Summary of Median Platelet Counts, Platelet counts were measured by blood draw., Baseline; Day 8 through Week 26 on-treatment; and 1, 2, 4 week follow-up visits|Percentage of Participants Initiating Rescue Treatment On-therapy, Percentage of participants initiating new ITP medication, an increased dose of concomitant ITP medication from baseline, platelet transfusion, or splenectomy., Anytime from Day 1 to Week 26|Maximum and Total Weeks of Platelet Response, Response is defined as a platelet count between 50,000 and 400,000 platelets per microliter., Day 1 through Week 26 on-treatment|Percentage of Participants With a Reduction in Use of Baseline ITP Medication, Percentage of participants who experienced a reduction in their baseline concomitant ITP medication use, From Day 1 through Week 26 on-treatment|WHO Bleeding Scale, Summary of World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scores at each nominal visit.
