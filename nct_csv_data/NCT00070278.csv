NCT00070278,"Neoadjuvant Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel With or Without Gemcitabine in Treating Women Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Early Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00070278,,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during surgery. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating early breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different regimens of combination chemotherapy to compare how well they work in treating women who are undergoing surgery for early invasive breast cancer.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: epirubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: paclitaxel|GENETIC: comparative genomic hybridization|GENETIC: microarray analysis|GENETIC: mutation analysis|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|PROCEDURE: neoadjuvant therapy,Complete pathological response after 4 courses,Survival|Disease-free survival|Effect of prognostic factors,,Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,,FEMALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,800,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CRUK-neo-tAnGo|CDR0000331863|EU-20316,2005-01,2007-09,,2003-10-07,,2013-08-07,"Addenbrooke's Hospital at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, England, CB2 2QQ, United Kingdom",
