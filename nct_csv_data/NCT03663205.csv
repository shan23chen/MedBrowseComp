NCT03663205,A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab Versus Chemotherapy in Advanced Non-Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03663205,,COMPLETED,This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and pemetrexed compared with platinum and pemetrexed alone as first-line treatment in participants with Stage IIIB or IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).,YES,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until first documentation of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the IRC per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Through primary analysis data cut-off date of 23JAN2020 (up to approximately 1 year and 6 months)","Objective Response Rate (ORR) by IRC Assessment, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by the IRC using RECIST v1.1., Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) by IRC Assessment, DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever comes first, as assessed by the IRC using RECIST v1.1 in participants with documented objective responses, Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause, Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)|PFS by Investigator Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until first objectively documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)|ORR by Investigator Assessment, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with CR or PR, as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)|DOR by Investigator Assessment, DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever comes first, as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 in participants with documented objective responses, Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer (EORTC QLQ-LC13), Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-CL13 scores for coughing, dyspnea, and chest pain . The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a questionnaire that measures lung cancer-specific disease and treatment symptoms. It includes questions about specific symptoms in which participants respond based on a 4-point scale, where 1 is ""not at all"" and 4 is ""very much"". Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A lower score indicates an improvement in symptoms., Baseline to Cycle 5 (each cycle is 21 days)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status, Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life score. The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 is a questionnaire that assesses quality of life of participants with cancer. It includes global health status and quality of life questions related to overall health in which participants respond based on a 7-point scale, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A higher score indicates better health outcomes., Baseline to Cycle 5 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), which includes laboratory tests, physical exams, electrocardiogram results and vital signs, according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)|PFS by IRC Based on Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until first documentation of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the IRC per RECIST v1.1, based on PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, Through study completion data cut-off date of 26APR2023 (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)",,BeiGene,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,334,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,BGB-A317-304|CTR20180032,2018-07-23,2020-01-23,2023-04-26,2018-09-10,2024-11-25,2025-03-25,"Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, 230000, China|Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, 100021, China|Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100142, China|Beijing Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100730, China|Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100730, China|Chinese Pla General Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100853, China|The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400010, China|Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400042, China|Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, Chongqing, 404000, China|Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350014, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China|Cancer Center of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510030, China|Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China|Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, 515031, China|Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, Guangxi, 541001, China|The Peoples Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China|Guizhou Cancer Hospital, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550000, China|The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Zunyi, Guizhou, 563000, China|Hainan General Hospital, Haikou, Hainan, 570206, China|Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150000, China|Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450052, China|Hubei Cancer Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, 430079, China|Changsha Central Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, 410004, China|Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, 410013, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University Branch Shizi, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215006, China|Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, 221000, China|The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China|The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110001, China|Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110042, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, Shaanxi, 710061, China|Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China|Jinan Central Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, 250013, China|Jinan Military General Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, 250031, China|Shandong Cancer Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, 250117, China|Weifang Peoples Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, 261000, China|Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200000, China|Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200030, China|West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China|Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, Tianjin, 300052, China|Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, Tianjin, 300060, China|Yunnan Cancer Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, 650100, China|The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China|Hangzhou First Peoples Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China|Zhejiang University College of Medicine Second Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310009, China|Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310016, China|Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310022, China","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/05/NCT03663205/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/05/NCT03663205/SAP_001.pdf"
