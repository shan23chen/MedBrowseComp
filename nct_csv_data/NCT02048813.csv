NCT02048813,"Ibrutinib and Rituximab Compared With Fludarabine Phosphate, Cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02048813,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase III trial studies ibrutinib and rituximab to see how well they work compared to fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in treating patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. It is not yet known whether fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab may work better than ibrutinib and rituximab in treating patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.",YES,Anemia|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|DRUG: Ibrutinib|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Pharmacogenomic Study|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 3 Years, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to CLL progression or death, whichever occurred first. Progression is characterized by any of the following:

* ≥ 50% increase from nadir since start of treatment (tx) in the sum of the products of at least 2 lymph nodes on 2 consecutive examinations 2 weeks apart
* ≥ 50% increase from nadir since start of tx in the size of liver and/or spleen
* ≥ 50% increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes not due to tumor flare reaction. The absolute lymphocyte count must be ≥ 5x10\^9/L to qualify as disease progression.
* Transformation to a more aggressive histology (e.g. Richter's syndrome or prolymphocytic leukemia with \> 55% prolymphocytes). For patients who achieve a complete response or nodular partial response, progression is defined as recurrence of circulating leukemia cell clone in the peripheral blood and an absolute lymphocyte count \> 5x10\^9/L and/or recurrence of palpable lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm by physical exam., Assessed every 3 months until progression up to 4 years and 8 months","Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 3 Years, Overall survival was defined as time from randomization to death from any cause or date last known alive. Overall survival rate at 3 years was estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier., Assessed every 3 months until progression; after progression, assessed every 3 months for first 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5, up to 4 years and 8 months|The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Leukemia (FACT-Leu) Trial Outcome Index (TOI) Score at 6 Months, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Leukemia (FACT-Leu) Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is comprised of the physical well-being (PWB) and functional well-being (FWB) components of the FACT-General (FACT-G) and the leukemia subscale. The FACT-Leu TOI contains a total of 31 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 124. The higher the score, the better the quality of life (QOL)., Assessed at 6 months|The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Leukemia (FACT-Leu) Trial Outcome Index (TOI) Score at 12 Months, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Leukemia (FACT-Leu) Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is comprised of the physical well-being (PWB) and functional well-being (FWB) components of the FACT-General (FACT-G) and the leukemia subscale. The FACT-Leu TOI contains a total of 31 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 124. The higher the score, the better the quality of life (QOL)., Assessed at 12 months|The Association Between Baseline Rai Stage and Complete Response (CR) Rate, Patients are classified as stage 0-IV according to the Rai system and categorized into one of the three risk groups:

Low risk - Stage 0 Intermediate risk - Stage I or II High risk - Stage III or IV

CR requires all of the following for at least 2 months:

* Absence of lymphadenopathy by physical examination on 2 occasions at least 4 weeks apart and appropriate radiographic techniques. For patients whose only measurable disease at the time of enrollment is on CT scan, a CT scan is required and all lymph nodes must be ≤ 1.5 cm before classifying the patient a CR.
* Absence of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination
* Absence of constitutional symptoms due to disease
* Normal complete blood count
* One marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed 52 weeks after Day 1 of cycle 1 among patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of a CR to document a CR. The marrow sample must be at least normocellular with \< 30% of nucleated cells being lymphocytes., Assessed at baseline, every 3 months for the first 2 years, and every 6 months for years 3-5|Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Measurable Residual Disease (MDR) Status at 2 Years, PFS was defined as time from randomization to progression or death. Progression is characterized by any of the following:

* ≥ 50% increase from nadir since start of treatment (tx) in the sum of the products of ≥ 2 lymph nodes on 2 consecutive exams 2 weeks apart
* ≥ 50% increase from nadir since start of tx in the size of liver and/or spleen
* ≥ 50% increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes not due to tumor flare reaction. The absolute lymphocyte count must be ≥ 5x10\^9/L to qualify as progression.
* Transformation to a more aggressive histology. For patients with a complete response or nodular partial response, progression is defined as recurrence of circulating leukemia cell clone in the peripheral blood and an absolute lymphocyte count \> 5x10\^9/L and/or recurrence of palpable lymphadenopathy \>1.5 cm by physical exam.

MRD status was evaluated at 2 years and samples with \<=20 monotypic events or an MRD level of \<10\^-4 were classified as undetectable MRD., Assessed every 3 months until progression up to 5 years","Distribution of Genetic Abnormalities Before and After Treatment, Genetic abnormalities are assessed at baseline and longitudinally during treatment as well as after treatment.
