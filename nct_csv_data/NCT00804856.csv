NCT00804856,Phase I/IIa Trial to Investigate BI 6727 (Volasertib) as Monotherapy or in Combination With Cytarabine in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00804856,,COMPLETED,"The trial will be performed in two parts, a phase I part and a phase IIa part. In the phase I part of the trial, BI 6727 will be investigated as monotherapy and in combination with low dose cytarabine (LD-Ara-C) in patients with relapsed/refractory AML that are not eligible for intensive treatment. The dose of BI 6727 will be escalated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 6727 monotherapy and BI 6727 in combination with LD-Ara-C in AML patients. In the phase IIa part, the combination of BI 6727 at MTD with LD-Ara-C and LD-Ara-C monotherapy will be investigated to explore the efficacy of the combination schedule in comparison to LD-Ara-C monotherapy in previously untreated AML patients that are not eligible for intensive treatment.",YES,"Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute",DRUG: Volasertib|DRUG: Cytarabine,"Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Volasertib in Combination With LDAC (Schedule A) and Volasertib Monotherapy (Schedule B), To determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose escalation was conducted following the 3+3 design with de-escalation. The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which 6 patients had been treated and less than 2 patients experienced a Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first cycle of treatment. The MTD was defined based on safety data from the first cycle only.

DLT is defined as drug related Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade ≥ 3 nonhaematological toxicity (excluding: untreated nausea, untreated vomiting, CTCAE grade 3 untreated diarrhoea, CTCAE grade 3 ""febrile neutropenia"" and CTCAE grade 3 ""infection with grade 3 or 4 neutrophils"").

In patients with complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or partial remission (PR), persistent CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia until three weeks after the end of the treatment cycle will be regarded a DLT., First Treatment cycle, up to 28 days.|Phase II: Number of Patients With Objective Response (Complete Remission (CR) + Complete Remission With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi)), Phase II: Number of patients with Objective Response (Complete remission (CR) + Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)).

Complete remission (CR): morphologically leukaemia-free state (i.e. bone marrow with \<5% blasts by morphologic criteria and no Auer rods, no evidence of extramedullary leukaemia) and absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/microliter (μL) and platelets \>100,000/μL.

Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (""incomplete"" CR, CRi): all of the above criteria for CR were met except that neutrophils \<1,000/μL or platelets \<100,000/μL in the blood were not achieved., The best overall response recorded during the time period from the start of the treatment until end of the treatment period, progression or death (whichever was earlier), up to 869 days.|Phase I: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the First Cycle for the Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), A DLT was defined as a drug related CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade ≥3 non-haematological toxicity (excluding untreated nausea, untreated vomiting, Grade 3 untreated diarrhea, Grade 3 febrile neutropenia, and Grade 3 infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutrophils). In patients with CRi (Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery) or PR (Partial Remission), persistent Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia for 3 weeks after the end of the treatment cycle was regarded as a DLT unless the respective Grade 4 cytopenia was preexistent. In patients who required platelet substitution to maintain a Grade \<4 before treatment, a Grade 4 thrombocytopenia after treatment did not constitute a DLT., First Treatment cycle, up to 28 days.","Best Overall Response, * CR
* CR+CRi
* Partial remission: CR except bone marrow (BM) contained ≥5% but \<25% blasts (or ≤50% initial blasts), or \<5% blasts in presence of Auer rods or abnormal morphology.
* No change: survived ≥7 days (d) after 1st cycle with persistent leukemia in last peripheral blood smear or BM, or with persistent extramedullary disease, without further deterioration due to leukemia or increase of blasts in BM or peripheral blood.
* Aplasia: survived ≥7d after 1st cycle, died whilst cytopenic, with last post-treatment BM result aplastic or hypoplastic and without leukemia blasts.
* Indeterminate: survived \<7 d after 1st cycle or survived ≥7d after 1st cycle, died with no persistent leukemia in peripheral smear but no post-treatment BM examination or did not complete 1st cycle.
* Progressive disease: survived ≥7d after 1st cycle with increase of blast population in BM or peripheral blood or aggravation or new extramedullary disease or further deterioration or death due to leukemia., The best overall response recorded during the time period from the start of the treatment until end of the treatment period, progression or death (whichever was earlier), up to 869 days.|Phase I: Number of Patients With Objective Response: Complete Remission or Complete Remission With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CR+CRi), Phase I: Number of patients with Objective Response (Complete remission (CR) + Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)).

Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (""incomplete"" CR, CRi): all of the above criteria for CR were met except that neutrophils \<1,000/μL or platelets \<100,000/μL in the blood were not achieved., The best overall response recorded during the time period from the start of the treatment until end of the treatment period, progression or death (whichever was earlier), up to 594 days.|Phase II: Event Free Survival, Event-free survival (EFS) \[days\] was the shortest duration of the following: (a) Date of assessment indicating PD on the response page of the eCRF (Electronic Case Report Form) - date of randomisation + 1 day (b) Date of assessment indicating clinical progressive disease (PD) on the disease or responses pages of the of eCRF- date of randomisation + 1 day (c) Date of assessment indicating PD on the patient status page of the eCRF - date of randomisation +1 day (for patients who had not been censored before this time point) (d) Death date - date of randomisation +1 day Patients not being assessed PD, clinical PD, or death during the trial were censored.
