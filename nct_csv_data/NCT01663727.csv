NCT01663727,"Study To Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety Of Bevacizumab, and Associated Biomarkers, In Combination With Paclitaxel Compared With Paclitaxel Plus Placebo as First-line Treatment Of Patients With Her2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01663727,,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab administered in combination with paclitaxel in patients with previously untreated, locally recurrent, or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: bevacizumab or placebo. All patients will be given an intravenous (IV) infusion of of paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) for 3 weeks during each 28-day cycle. bevacizumab or placebo (10 mg/kg) will be administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
