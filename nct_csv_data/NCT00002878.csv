NCT00002878,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without PSC 833 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00002878,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Some tumors become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Combining PSC 833 with chemotherapy may reduce resistance to the drug, and allow more tumor cells to be killed. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus PSC 833 is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with or without PSC 833 in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.",NO,Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm,DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: valspodar|DRUG: vincristine sulfate,,,,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|SWOG Cancer Research Network|Cancer and Leukemia Group B|NCIC Clinical Trials Group|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000065178|E-1A95|CAN-NCIC-MY8|CLB-E1A95|EORTC-E1A95/06971|SWOG-E1A95|CAN-NCIC-J1A95|CLB-9596|SWOG-S1A95,1997-06-30,2003-04,,2003-07-09,,2023-06-15,"University of California San Diego Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093-0658, United States|UCSF Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute, San Francisco, California, 94143-0128, United States|CCOP - Christiana Care Health Services, Wilmington, Delaware, 19899, United States|Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20307-5000, United States|CCOP - Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, 33140, United States|University of Chicago Cancer Research Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637-1470, United States|Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center at The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242-1009, United States|Marlene & Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201, United States|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01655, United States|University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|Ellis Fischel Cancer Center - Columbia, Columbia, Missouri, 65203, United States|Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, 68198-3330, United States|CCOP - Southern Nevada Cancer Research Foundation, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89106, United States|Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, 03756-0002, United States|Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, 14263-0001, United States|CCOP - North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, New York, 11030, United States|Schneider Children's Hospital at North Shore, Manhasset, New York, 11030, United States|Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10021, United States|New York Presbyterian Hospital - Cornell Campus, New York, New York, 10021, United States|Mount Sinai Medical Center, NY, New York, New York, 10029, United States|State University of New York - Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, 13210, United States|CCOP - Syracuse Hematology-Oncology Associates of Central New York, P.C., Syracuse, New York, 13217, United States|Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, UNC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27599-7295, United States|Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|CCOP - Southeast Cancer Control Consortium, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27104-4241, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Center at Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27157-1082, United States|Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, 02903, United States|University of Tennessee, Memphis Cancer Center, Memphis, Tennessee, 38103, United States|Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, Vermont, 05401-3498, United States|MBCCOP - Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, Virginia, 23298-0037, United States|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|Moncton Hospital, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 6ZB, Canada|Cancer Care Ontario-London Regional Cancer Centre, London, Ontario, N6A 4L6, Canada|Hotel Dieu Health Sciences Hospital - Niagara, St. Catharines, Ontario, L2R 5K3, Canada|Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2C4, Canada|Cancer Care Ontario - Windsor Regional Cancer Centre, Windsor, Ontario, N8W 2X3, Canada|Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H2L-4M1, Canada|McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, H2W 1S6, Canada",
