NCT03189719,First-line Esophageal Carcinoma Study With Pembrolizumab Plus Chemo vs. Chemo (MK-3475-590/KEYNOTE-590),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03189719,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus placebo plus SOC chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU as first-line treatment in participants with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma.

The overall primary efficacy hypotheses are as follows:

1. In participants with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), participants whose tumors are programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive (defined as combined positive score \[CPS\] ≥10), ESCC participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and in all participants, overall survival (OS) is superior with pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.
2. In participants with ESCC, participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and in all participants, progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by investigator is superior with pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.",YES,Esophageal Neoplasms,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: 5-FU,"Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) Whose Tumors Are Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Biomarker-Positive (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.
