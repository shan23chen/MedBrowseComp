Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. An interim analysis of OS in the global cohort was pre-specified after approximately 318 OS events occurred each between the D + EP and EP groups (60% maturity), and between the D + T + EP and EP groups (60% maturity). At the global cohort interim analysis DCO (11 March 2019), comparison of OS in the D + EP versus (vs) EP groups had crossed the pre-specified boundary. Since these results were considered final in terms of formal statistical testing, they are presented here as a primary outcome measure. Analysis of OS for D + EP vs EP and for D + T + EP vs EP at the time of the global cohort final analysis is presented separately in the subsequent primary outcome measure., From baseline until death due to any cause. Assessed until global cohort interim analysis DCO (maximum of approximately 23 months).|OS in the Global Cohort; Assessed at Global Cohort Final Analysis; D + EP Compared With EP and D + T + EP Compared With EP, OS was defined as the time from date of randomization until death due to any cause.
