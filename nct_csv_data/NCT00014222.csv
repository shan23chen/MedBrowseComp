NCT00014222,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Colony-stimulating Factors in Treating Women With Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00014222,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE:

1. . To compare the effects on breast cancer of three different combinations of drugs which are commonly used to treat this disease.
2. . It is not yet known which treatment regimen is most effective for breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy given with or without epoetin alfa in treating women who have undergone surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.",YES,Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: epoetin alfa|BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: epirubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: paclitaxel,"Disease Free Survival, Disease free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the time of recurrence of the primary disease. Local or nodal recurrence and metastatic disease were considered a recurrence of the primary tumour. Patients who had contralateral breast cancer or a second primary malignancy, or died from some cause other than disease were censored as relapse-free at the time of death. Patients who had not relapsed were censored at longest follow-up or at non-breast cancer death. As required, adjudication was used to assess reports of recurrence., 13 years","Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to the time of death from any cause, with censoring at longest follow-up., 13 years",,NCIC Clinical Trials Group,North Central Cancer Treatment Group|SWOG Cancer Research Network|Cancer and Leukemia Group B,FEMALE,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE3,2104,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,MA21|CAN-NCIC-MA21|AMGEN-CAN-NCIC-MA21|NCCTG-CAN-NCIC-MA21|BMS-CAN-NCIC-MA21|JANSSEN-ORTHO-CAN-NCIC-MA21|PFIZER-CAN-NCIC-MA21|SWOG-CAN-NCIC-MA21|CDR0000068520|CALGB-CAN-NCIC-MA21,2000-12-04,2014-02-10,2014-03-17,2003-01-27,2020-03-10,2020-10-05,"Sparks-Arkansas Oklahoma Cancer Treatment Centre, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 72901, United States|Hematology Oncology Services of Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|Scripps Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Centre, Aurora, Colorado, 80010-0510, United States|Greenwich Hospital - Bendheim Cancer Center, Greenwich, Connecticut, 06830, United States|Sibley Memorial Hospital, Oncology Research, Washington, District of Columbia, 20016, United States|Comprehensive Cancer Care Centre at Boca Raton, Boca Raton, Florida, 33428, United States|University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0277, United States|Florida Oncology Associates, Orange Park, Florida, 32073, United States|The University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60637-1470, United States|Therapy Associates, Inc., Hematology/Oncology, Evansville, Indiana, 47715, United States|Lexington Oncology Assts./Central Baptist Hospital, Lexington, Kentucky, 40503, United States|Consultants in Blood Disorders and Cancer, Louisville, Kentucky, 40207, United States|CHRISTUS Schumpert Medical Center - Hem/Onc Clinic, Shreveport, Louisiana, 71101, United States|Willis-Knighton Cancer Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, 71103-3, United States|Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Blood Disorders, Scarborough, Maine, 04074-9308, United States|Maine General Medical Center, Waterville, Maine, 04901, United States|Suburban Hospital Cancer Program, Bethesda, Maryland, 20817, United States|Associates in Oncology/Hematology, Rockville, Maryland, 20850, United States|Saint Joseph Medical Center, Cancer Care Program, Towson, Maryland, 21204, United States|Baystate Regional Cancer Program, Springfield, Massachusetts, 01107, United States|St. Luke's Cancer Care Centre, Duluth, Minnesota, 55802, United States|University of Minnesota Cancer Centre, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|Columbia-Capitol Comprehensive Care Clinics, Jefferson City, Missouri, 65109, United States|Saint Louis University Hospital, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110-0250, United States|Nebraska Methodist Hospital, Omaha, Nebraska, 68114, United States|Creighton University Cancer Centre, Omaha, Nebraska, 68131, United States|Advanced Oncology Associates, Armonk, New York, 10504, United States|Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, Bronx, New York, 10466, United States|Queens Medical Associates, PC, Fresh Meadows, New York, 11366, United States|Winthrop University Hospital Onc/Hem, Mineola, New York, 11501, United States|Hematology Oncol.
