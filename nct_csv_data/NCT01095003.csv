NCT01095003,Trial of Vinflunine Plus Capecitabine in Advanced Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01095003,,COMPLETED,"The increasing use of anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and first-line metastatic settings, led to a raise of patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer after treatment with these agents. Options for the treatment of patients who have progressed after an anthracycline and a taxane are limited. The high level of in-vitro synergy of vinflunine combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) together with the good tolerance and the encouraging response rate observed while combining IV vinflunine to oral capecitabine make it a promising combination to investigate further in a phase III trial. This phase III trial will evaluate the effectiveness and the safety profile of such combination for the treatment of patient with advanced breast cancer previously treated with or resistant to anthracycline and taxane resistant.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: Vinflunine plus Capecitabine|DRUG: Capecitabine,"Progression Free Survival, PFS is defined as time from date of randomization to date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (according to the Independent Response Review Committee (IRC) and based on RECIST version 1.1) or death due to any cause.

The PFS was primarily analysed in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Patients lost to follow-up, or without a known record of progression or death at time of analysis had the progression-free survival censored at the date of last tumour assessment or the date of last contact of a follow-up showing no progression, whichever occurs last., Baseline up to 2 years 7 months","Overall Survival, The overall survival (OS) was defined as the duration between the date of randomisation and the date of death from any cause. The OS analysis was performed in the ITT population and the eligible and per protocol populations once the required number of events (631 deaths) was observed Patients lost to follow-up, or without a known record of death at time of analysis had the OS censored at the date of last contact., Baseline upto 3 years 10 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as documentation of complete or partial response that was subsequently confirmed to first documentation of disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline upto 2 years 7 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate defined (DCR) as the sum of confirmed complete response, confirmed partial response and stabilisation rate., Baseline up to 2 years 7 months|Duration of Response, Measured from the first time that measurement criteria were first met for objective response (documented CR or PR) until recurrence/progression or death whatever the cause., Baseline up to 2 years 7 months",,Pierre Fabre Medicament,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,770,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,L00070 IN 305 B0|2008-004171-21,2009-05,2011-12,2015-10,2010-03-29,2019-09-13,2022-04-28,"Buenos Aires, Argentina|Quilmes, Argentina|Rosario, Argentina|San Martin, Argentina|Tucuman, Argentina|Gomel, Belarus|Grodno, Belarus|Minsk, Belarus|Vitebsk, Belarus|Bruxelles, Belgium|Liège, Belgium|Curitiba, Brazil|Porto Alegre, Brazil|Santo Andre, Brazil|Sao Paulo, Brazil|Plovdiv, Bulgaria|Sofia, Bulgaria|Stara Zagora, Bulgaria|Brno, Czechia|Jihlava, Czechia|Tallinn, Estonia|Angers, France|Caen, France|Dijon, France|Le Mans, France|Lorient, France|Lyon, France|Montpellier, France|Nantes, France|Saint-Brieuc, France|Saint-Cloud, France|Saint-Herblain, France|Tours, France|Villejuif, France|Budapest, Hungary|Szekesfehervar, Hungary|Szolnok, Hungary|Aurangabad, India|Bangalore, India|Bhopal, India|Calcutta, India|Calicut, India|Jaipur, India|Mumbai, India|Patna, India|Pune, India|Trivandrum, India|Avellino, Italy|Cagliari, Italy|Cremona, Italy|Fabriano, Italy|Milano, Italy|Monza, Italy|Padova, Italy|Pisa, Italy|Rozzano, Italy|Verona, Italy|Chihuahua, Mexico|Leon, Mexico|Mexico City, Mexico|Saltillo, Mexico|Bialystok, Poland|Gdansk, Poland|Krakow, Poland|Lodz, Poland|Lubin, Poland|Warsawa, Poland|Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation|Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation|Moscow, Russian Federation|Ryazan, Russian Federation|Saratov, Russian Federation|St-Petersburg, Russian Federation|Stavropol, Russian Federation|Tambov, Russian Federation|Ufa, Russian Federation|Vladimir, Russian Federation|Volgograd, Russian Federation|Nis, Serbia|Sremska Kamenica, Serbia|Durban, South Africa|Kimberley, South Africa|Pretoria, South Africa|Sandton, South Africa|Barcelona, Spain|Lleida, Spain|Madrid, Spain|Oviedo, Spain|Valencia, Spain|Genolier, Switzerland|Lausanne, Switzerland|Winterthur, Switzerland|Taipei, Taiwan|Taoyuan, Taiwan|Cherkasy, Ukraine|Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine|Donetsk, Ukraine|Khmelnytskyï, Ukraine|Kyiv, Ukraine|Simferopol, Ukraine|Belfast, United Kingdom|Chelmsford, United Kingdom|Keighley, United Kingdom|London, United Kingdom|Nottingham, United Kingdom|Peterborough, United Kingdom|Portsmouth, United Kingdom|Sheffield, United Kingdom|Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom|Sutton, United Kingdom",
