NCT02260804,To Compare Efficacy and Safety Between CT-P10 and Rituxan in Patients With Low Tumour Burden Follicular Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02260804,,COMPLETED,To demonstrate that CT-P10 is similar to Rituxan in terms of efficacy as determined by overall response rate at 7 months,YES,Follicular Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: CT-P10|BIOLOGICAL: Rituxan,"Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Overall Response Rate by 7 Months, ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best response of complete response (CR), unconfirmed CR (CRu), or partial response (PR) by central review.

Per 1999 IWG criteria, the disease status was assessed by using contrasted CT and/or MRI, and CR, CRu, and PR were defined as followings; CR=Disappearance of all clinical/radiographic evidence of disease: regression of lymph nodes to normal size, absence of B-symptoms, bone marrow involvement, and organomegaly, and normal LDH level; CRu=Regression of measurable disease: \>75% decrease in SPD of target lesions and in each target lesions. no increase in the size of non-target lesions, neither new lesion nor organomegaly measured; PR=Regression of measurable disease: ≥50% decrease in SPD of target lesions and no evidence of disease progression., During the Month 7 (up to Maintenance Cycle 3; Week 28)","Secondary Efficacy Endpoint - ORR Over the Study Period, ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best response of complete response (CR), unconfirmed CR (CRu), or partial response (PR).

Locally reviewed data was used for the secondary efficacy analyses., Overall study period (Baseline, Month 3, 7, 13, 19 27, and every 6 months thereafter).|Secondary Efficacy Endpoint - Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the interval between randomization and death from any cause. Locally reviewed data was used for the secondary efficacy analyses., Overall study period (median follow-up of 29.2 months)|Secondary Efficacy Endpoint - Time-to Progression (TTP), Time to progression was defined as the interval between randomization and disease progression/relapse by IWG 1999 (at least a 50% increase of any single nodal after smallest decrease) or death as a result of lymphoma, whichever occurred first.
