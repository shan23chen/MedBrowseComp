NCT02810457,Evaluation of FKB238 and Avastin in Patients With Advanced/Recurrent Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02810457,AVANA,COMPLETED,The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of FKB238 against Avastin® in men and women with advanced/recurrent non squamous non-small cell lung cancer,YES,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",DRUG: FKB238 (bevacizumab)|DRUG: Avastin (bevacizumab)|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin,"Overall Response Rate (ORR) Assessed as the Proportion of Patients With a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), The primary variable in this study was ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR or PR (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)). A BOR was defined as the best response (in the order of CR, PR, stable disease (SD), no evidence of disease (NED), progressive disease (PD), and not evaluable (NE)) among all post-baseline disease assessments that occurred until progression, or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, irrespective of whether or not patients discontinued the study treatment. The 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence interval (CI) of ORR for each treatment arm was provided. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by computed tomography (CT) or, if contraindicated, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Overall Response=CR+PR., Until data cut-off, which occurred 12 months after randomization of the last patient enrolled, for a total estimated period of time of up to approximately 30 months.","ORR at Week 19, ORR (by RECIST v1.1) at Week 19 was defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR or PR assessed at Week 19. Only tumor assessments performed up until 19 weeks (i.e. Week 18 assessment + 7 day assessment window) from randomization were considered in this analysis. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT or, if contraindicated, MRI: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Overall Response=CR+PR., From the date of randomization up to Week 19.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The event of interest for PFS was defined as the interval from the date of randomization until first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was based on tumor assessments according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. The items of the overall response CR, PR, SD and NED were taken as progression-free whereas PD denoted disease progression. PFS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the quartiles for each treatment arm, and 95% CIs for the medians were calculated. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT or, if contraindicated, MRI: PD=at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Until data cut-off, which occurred 12 months after randomization of the last patient enrolled, for a total estimated period of time of up to approximately 30 months.|Overall Survival (OS), The event of interest was defined as death from any cause. OS was defined as the interval from date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause. OS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the quartiles for each treatment arm, and 95% CIs for the medians were calculated., Until data cut-off, which occurred 12 months after randomization of the last patient enrolled, for a total estimated period of time of up to approximately 30 months.|Duration Of Response (DOR), DOR was evaluated in this study as a secondary efficacy endpoint. Only the patients defined as responders in the primary analysis of ORR were taken into account for the analysis of DOR. The event of interest was defined as first documented disease progression or death due to any reason, whichever occurred first. DOR was defined as the interval from the first documented response (as defined per RECIST v1.1) until the earlier date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any reason. The date of first documented response was taken as the date of the first tumor assessment with an overall visit response of CR or PR. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT or, if contraindicated, MRI: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions. DOR was calculated in units of months., Until data cut-off, which occurred 12 months after randomization of the last patient enrolled, for a total estimated period of time of up to approximately 30 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Assessed as the Proportion of Patients With a BOR of Either CR, PR, SD or NED, The DCR was defined as the proportion of patients defined as responders. The number and percentage of responders and non-responders and the 95% Pearson-Clopper CI of DCR for each treatment arm was provided. The odds ratio for treatment (FKB238 arm versus Avastin arm) and the corresponding 95% Wald CI were produced based on a logistic regression analysis of DCR. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT or, if contraindicated, MRI: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions; SD=neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study. DCR=CR+PR+SD (≥ 6 weeks)., Until data cut-off, which occurred 12 months after randomization of the last patient enrolled, for a total estimated period of time of up to approximately 30 months.","Serum Trough Concentration (Ctrough), Ctrough (pre-infusion) and serum maximum concentration (Cmax; at completion of infusion) were compared between treatment arms and time points, and descriptive statistics provided. Ctrough and Cmax concentrations were summarized using the pharmacokinetics (PK) population for each visit at which samples were taken. The pre-dose serum concentrations at Cycles 2, 4, and 6 were considered as Ctrough values and the post-dose serum concentrations at Cycles 1 and 4 were considered as Cmax values. PK data at Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-infusion were not calculable and are therefore not presented in the outcome measure data table. Data are only provided for the time points at which the serum trough concentration was measured., Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre- and post-infusion), Cycle 2 Day 1 (pre), Cycle 4 Day 1 (pre and post), Cycle 6 Day 1 (pre), discontinuation visit, and every 12 weeks (up to 1 year [±14 days] after randomisation) until death, or the patient was lost to follow-up.|Proportion of Patients Developing Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs), The ADA levels were summarized at baseline and post-baseline time points using descriptive statistics., Pre-dose at Cycles 1, 2, 4 and 6, discontinuation visit, and every 12 weeks (up to 1 year [±14 days] after randomisation) until death, or the patient was lost to follow-up, whichever occurred first.|Adverse Events (AEs), From the time of signature of informed consent, throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 30-days after the last dose of study treatment, for a total estimated period of time of up to approximately 30 months.|Vital Signs, Up to approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatment.|Hematology, Up to approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatment.|Clinical Chemistry, Up to approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatment.|Urinalysis, Up to approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatment.|Electrocardiogram, Up to approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatment.|Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group Performance Status, Up to approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatment.|Physical Examination, Up to approximately 30 days after last dose of study treatment.",Centus Biotherapeutics Limited,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,731,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",FKB238-002|2015-004104-33,2016-09-07,2019-01-24,2022-01-26,2016-06-23,2020-03-19,2022-03-10,"Research Site 7814 - Compassionate Care Research Group, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|Research Site 7811 - Innovative Clinical Research Institute, Whittier, California, 90603, United States|Research Site 7803 - 21st Century Oncology, Jacksonville, Florida, 32204, United States|Research Site 7812 - Joliet Oncology-Hematology Associates, Ltd., Joliet, Illinois, 60435, United States|Research Site 7810 - Edward H.
