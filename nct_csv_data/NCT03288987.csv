NCT03288987,Comparing Efficacy and Safety of Stivant (AryoGen Bevacizumab) Versus Avastin in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03288987,,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase III, randomized, two arms, double-blind (patient and assessor blinded), parallel active non inferiority controlled clinical trial with a 2:1 allocation. This trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (produced by AryoGen Pharmed) plus FOLFIRI-3 compared with bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus FOLFIRI-3 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients who met the following criteria could be recruited to receive the mentioned intervention randomly. Inclusion criteria: male or female aged 18-75 years, mCRC verified histologically, Having one or more bi-dimensionally measurable lesions as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, Was not felt to be amenable to curative resection, With an (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1, Life expectancy of longer than 3 months, Adequate organ and marrow function, May have received adjuvant therapy for primary colorectal cancer provided that at least 6 months have elapsed from the time the adjuvant therapy was concluded and recurrent disease was documented, Patients with history of hypertension must be well-controlled (blood pressure less than/equal to 150/100), on a stable regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy.",YES,Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: Bevacizumab + FOLFIRI-3,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of documentation progression (per investigator assessment) or death as a result of any cause., PFS was measured from the start of chemotherapy to the date of disease progression or to the date of death if no progression whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months","Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival OS was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, Up to 12 months|Objective Response Rate, Tumor response was defined as partial and complete responses, according to the RECIST criteria ( version 1.1). The definitions were as follows: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), decrease of at least 30% in the lesion that has the largest diameter; Objective Response Rate (ORR) = CR + PR., Up to 12 months|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of each of the following,

* The treatment modalities did not destroy or modify the cancer cells,
* The tumor either became larger (disease progression) or stayed the same size after treatment,
* Death due to any cause,
* Discontinuation of treatment, Up to 12 months|Incidence of the Adverse Events, Safety was assessed on the basis of reports of adverse events, laboratory-test results, and vital sign measurements. Adverse events were categorized According to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute, version 5.0, in which a grade of 1 indicates mild adverse events, a grade of 2 moderate adverse events, a grade of 3 serious adverse events, and a grade of 4 life-threatening adverse events, Up to 12 months|Number of Positive Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Samples Among Patients (Immunogenicity), Anti-drug antibody assessment, Up to 12 months",,AryoGen Pharmed Co.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,126,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",BEV.ARY.HR.94 (III),2016-10-04,2018-07-30,2018-07-30,2017-09-20,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,"Shafa Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Hamadān, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Saba Clinic, Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Sheikh Mofid, Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Payandeh Clinic, Kermanshah, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Shazad Clinic, Kermanshah, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Qaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Rasool Hospital, Rasht, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Razi Hospital, Rasht, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Firoozgar Hospital, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Imam Reza Hospital (501 Artesh), Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Masoud Internal Clinic, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Safa najafi clinic, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Shariati Hospital, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Sina Hospital, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Taleqani Hospital, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Mortazavizadeh Clinic, Yazd, Iran, Islamic Republic of|Seyedshohada Hospital, Yazd, Iran, Islamic Republic of","Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/87/NCT03288987/SAP_000.pdf|Study Protocol and Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/87/NCT03288987/Prot_ICF_001.pdf"
