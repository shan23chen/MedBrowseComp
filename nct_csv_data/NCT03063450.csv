NCT03063450,CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03063450,CONFIRM,UNKNOWN,"The UK has the highest incidence of mesothelioma. The incidence has risen by 497% since the late 1970's and is increasing worldwide due to continued mining and use of asbestos. For patients with mesothelioma who have relapsed after taking pemetrexed and cisplatin, there is currently no standard treatment, making this an urgent unmet need. Recent trials in this area have not found an effective treatment that improves overall survival.

Following a debate in the House of Lords, a national survey assessing the research priorities in mesothelioma found that 'exploiting the potential of immunotherapy' was a top priority. This trial was designed in response to that survey. It uses the immunotherapy agent nivolumab which blocks programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on activated T-cells (a type of white blood cell forming part of the immune system). Early research has found a dependency of mesothelioma on the PD-1 checkpoint. By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action (checkpoint inhibition), preventing it from turning off the T-cell, and therefore allowing the immune system to work. PD-1 checkpoint inhibition has revolutionised the treatment of melanoma and it is hoped to be as effective in mesothelioma.

This trial is a randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial of patients with mesothelioma who are second or third relapse following a platinum based chemotherapy treatment. Patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio (nivolumab: placebo).

336 patients will be recruited from 25 UK centres with the last patient having a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients will be on treatment for 12 months unless they progress or withdrawal prior to this.",NO,Mesothelioma,DRUG: Nivolumab|OTHER: Placebo,"Overall survival, Time from randomisation to date of death from any cause, assessed up to 51 months|Progression free survival (modified RECIST or RECIST 1.1), Length of time patients are free from disease through study completion, Time from randomisation to progression, assessed up to 51 months","Overall response rate (modified RECIST or RECIST 1.1), Response of disease to treatment, Time from randomisation to progression through study completion, assessed up to 51 months|Quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), At baseline, after cycles 3 and 6 (each cycle is 14 days) and 1, 6 and 12 months post progression/treatment discontinuation.|Toxicity (CTCAE V4.03), At baseline, after each treatment cycle (each cycle is 14 days) and each follow up visit.
