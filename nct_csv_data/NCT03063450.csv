NCT03063450,CheckpOiNt Blockade For Inhibition of Relapsed Mesothelioma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03063450,CONFIRM,COMPLETED,"The UK has the highest incidence of mesothelioma. The incidence has risen by 497% since the late 1970's and is increasing worldwide due to continued mining and use of asbestos. For patients with mesothelioma who have relapsed after taking pemetrexed and cisplatin, there is currently no standard treatment, making this an urgent unmet need. Recent trials in this area have not found an effective treatment that improves overall survival.

Following a debate in the House of Lords, a national survey assessing the research priorities in mesothelioma found that 'exploiting the potential of immunotherapy' was a top priority. This trial was designed in response to that survey. It uses the immunotherapy agent nivolumab which blocks programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on activated T-cells (a type of white blood cell forming part of the immune system). Early research has found a dependency of mesothelioma on the PD-1 checkpoint. By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action (checkpoint inhibition), preventing it from turning off the T-cell, and therefore allowing the immune system to work. PD-1 checkpoint inhibition has revolutionised the treatment of melanoma and it is hoped to be as effective in mesothelioma.
