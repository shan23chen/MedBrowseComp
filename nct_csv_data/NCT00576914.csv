The patients with completely resected stage IB to stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to the group of vinorelbine plus cisplatin plus endostar or to the group of vinorelbine plus cisplatin . The primary end point was overall survival; principal secondary end points were recurrence-free survival and the toxicity and safety of the regimens.",NO,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: recombinant human endostatin,"overall survival, five year","recurrence-free survival and the toxicity and safety of the regimens, 5 year",,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences|Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine|Beijing Chao Yang Hospital,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1108,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2006 BAI02A02[1]-01,2007-06,2012-06,2012-06,2007-12-19,,2010-03-09,"The Lung Cancer Center of Cancer Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100021, China",
