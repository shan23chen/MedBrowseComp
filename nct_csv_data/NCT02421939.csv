NCT02421939,A Study of ASP2215 Versus Salvage Chemotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) With FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase (FLT3) Mutation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02421939,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical benefit of ASP2215 therapy in participants with FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are refractory to or have relapsed after first-line AML therapy as shown with overall survival (OS) compared to salvage chemotherapy, and to determine the efficacy of ASP2215 therapy as assessed by the rate of complete remission and complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CR/CRh) in these participants.

This study will also determine the overall efficacy in event-free survival (EFS) and complete remission (CR) rate of ASP2215 compared to salvage chemotherapy.",YES,"Leukemia, Acute Myeloid (AML)","DRUG: gilteritinib|DRUG: LoDAC (Low Dose Cytarabine)|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: MEC (Mitoxantrone, Etoposide, Cytarabine)|DRUG: FLAG-IDA (Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), Fludarabine, Cytarabine, Idarubicin)","Duration of Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause (death date - randomization date + 1). For a participant who was not known to have died by the end of study follow-up, OS was censored at the date of last contact (date of last contact - randomized date + 1). The date of last contact was the latest date that the participant was known to be alive by the cutoff date. The last contact date was derived for participants alive at the analysis cutoff date. Survival rate and 95% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Greenwood formula., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median time of follow-up for OS was 17.8 months|Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission and Complete Remission With Partial Hematological Recovery (CR/CRh) in the Gilteritinib Arm, The CR/CRh rate was defined as the number of participants who achieved either CR or CRh at any of the postbaseline visits divided by the number of participants in the analysis population., From randomization until the data cut-off date 04 Aug 2017, the 142 patients included in the primary analysis of CR/CRh rate were followed up at least 112 days","Duration of Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of documented relapse (excluding relapse after PR), treatment failure or death from any cause within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever occurred first (earliest of \[relapse date, treatment failure date, death date\] - randomization date + 1). If a participant experienced relapse or death within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the participant was defined as having an EFS event related to either ""relapse"" or ""death"", and the event date was the date of relapse or death. For a participant who was not known to have had a relapse or treatment failure or death event, EFS was censored at the date of last relapse-free disease assessment (last relapse-free disease assessment date - randomization date + 1). Data was estimated based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median time of follow-up for OS was 17.8 months|Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission (CR) Rate, The CR rate was defined as the number of participants who achieved the best response of CR divided by the number of participants in the analysis population., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, all participants included in the primary analysis of CR rate were followed up at least 6 months|Duration of Leukemia-Free Survival (LFS), The LFS was defined as the time from the date of first CRc until the date of documented relapse (excluding relapse from PR) or death for participants who achieved CRc (relapse date or death date - first CRc disease assessment date + 1). For a participant who was not known to have relapsed or died, LFS was censored on the date of last relapse-free disease assessment date (last relapse-free disease assessment date - first CRc disease assessment date + 1). For a participant who was not known to have relapsed or died, LFS was censored on the date of last relapse-free disease assessment date (last relapse-free disease assessment date - first CRc disease assessment date + 1)., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median time of follow-up for OS was 17.8 months|Duration of Remission, Duration of remission included duration of composite complete remission (CRc), duration of complete remission (CR)/ complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), duration of CRh, duration of CR and duration of response (CRc + partial remission (PR). The duration of response was defined as the time from the date of either first CRc or PR until the date of documented relapse (i.e., the date of first NR after CRc or PR) for participants who achieved CRc or PR (relapse date - first CRc or PR disease assessment date + 1). Participants who died without report of relapse were considered nonevents and censored at their last relapse-free disease assessment date (last relapse-free disease assessment date - first CRc or PR disease assessment date + 1). Other participants who did not relapse during the study were considered nonevents and censored at the last relapse-free assessment date. Duration of CR was only applicable to participants with best overall response of CR., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median time of follow-up for OS was 17.8 months|Percentage of Participants With Composite Complete Remission (CRc Rate), CRc rate was defined as the number of participants who achieved the best response of CRc (CR,complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) divided by the number of participants in the analysis population., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median time of follow-up for OS was 17.8 months|Percentage of Participants Who Underwent Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, Transplantation rate is defined as the percentage of participants undergoing Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) during the study period., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median time of follow-up for OS was 17.8 months|Change From Baseline in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a screening tool designed to assess the severity and impact of fatigue on daily functioning of participants with cancer during the 24 hours. There are 9 items on the scale. The first three questions ask participants to rate their fatigues on a scale from 0 (no fatigue) - 10 (as bad as you can imagine), with higher scores indicating worse outcome. The remaining six questions ask participants to rate how much fatigue has interfered with their daily activities on a scale from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes). A global fatigue score can be obtained by averaging all the items on the BFI. The global BFI score will be calculated only if at least 5 of the 9 items are answered. A higher BFI fatigue score indicates worse outcome., Baseline and cycle 1, day 8 and cycle 2 day 1 (up to data cut off date of 17 Sep 2018)|Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission (CR) With Partial Hematological Recovery (CRh), CRh rate was defined as the number of participants who achieved CRh at any of the postbaseline visits and did not have a best response of CR divided by the number of participants in the analysis population., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median time of follow-up for OS was 17.8 months|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Transfusion Conversion and Maintenance, Transfusion conversion \& maintenance rate was defined for gilteritinib arm. Participants were classified as transfusion independent if there were no RBC or platelet transfusions within 28 days prior to the first dose to 28 days after the first dose; otherwise they were classified as transfusion dependent at baseline. Participants were considered independent postbaseline if they had 1 consecutive 8 week period without any RBC or platelet transfusion from 29 days after the first dose until the last dose date. For participants who were on treatment â‰¤ 4 weeks or \> 4 weeks but \< 12 weeks and there was no RBC or platelet transfusion within postbaseline period, they were considered not evaluable; otherwise, they were considered postbaseline transfusion dependent. Transfusion conversion rate was defined for participants who had evaluable postbaseline transfusion status. Transfusion status (independent vs. dependent) at baseline and postbaseline was reported in a 2 by 2 contingency table., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median treatment duration for gilteritinib was (126.00 [4.0, 885.0]) days versus salvage chemotherapy 28.0 [5.0, 217.0] days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug (gilteritinib or salvage chemotherapy). If the AE occurred on day 1 and the onset check box was marked ""Onset after first dose of study drug"" or the onset check box was left blank, then the AE was considered treatment emergent. If the AE occurred on day 1 and the onset check box was marked ""Onset before first dose of study drug"", then the AE was not considered treatment emergent. Majority of salvage chemotherapy participants finished the study by cycle 2 of treatment, the duration of exposure was longer in the gilteritinib arm compared with the salvage chemotherapy arm (126.00 \[4.0, 885.0\] days versus 28.0 \[5.0, 217.0\] days). The NCI-CTCAE is defined as National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (median treatment duration for gilteritinib was (126.00 [4.0, 885.0]) days versus salvage chemotherapy 28.0 [5.0, 217.0] days)",,"Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT,
