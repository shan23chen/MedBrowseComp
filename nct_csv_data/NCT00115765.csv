NCT00115765,PACCE: Panitumumab Advanced Colorectal Cancer Evaluation Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00115765,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to assess whether treatment with the study drug, panitumumab given concomitantly with every 2 (Q2) week oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to treatment Q2-week with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab alone. All subjects will receive Q2-week oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Control arm subjects will not receive concomitant panitumumab therapy.",YES,Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: Oxaliplatin Based Chemotherapy|DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: Irinotecan Based Chemotherapy|DRUG: Bevacizumab,"Progression-Free Survival (Oxaliplatin), Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to death from any cause or first observed disease progression, Overall study|Objective Tumor Response Through Week 12 (Irinotecan), Objective tumor response (complete or partial) rate through week 12 based on central review in the Irinotecan stratum, Overall Study","Overall Survival (Oxaliplatin), Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to death from any cause in groups treated with Oxaliplatin, Overall study|Objective Tumor Response Rate (Oxaliplatin), Best overall response of complete or partial response within oxaliplatin stratum, Overall study|Time to Progression (Oxaliplatin), Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to disease progression or death due to disease progression within the oxaliplatin stratum, Overall Study|Time to Treatment Failure (Oxaliplatin), Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to the date the decision was made to discontinue treatment for a reason other than a complete response to treatment within the oxaliplatin stratum., Overall study|Overall Survival (Irinotecan), Incidence of mortality from any cause in groups treated with Irinotecan.
