NCT02775435,A Study of Carboplatin-Paclitaxel/Nab-Paclitaxel Chemotherapy With or Without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Adults With First Line Metastatic Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-407/KEYNOTE-407),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02775435,,COMPLETED,"This is a study of carboplatin and paclitaxel or nano particle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) with or without pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) in adults with first line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The primary hypotheses are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs: 1) Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by a blinded central imaging vendor compared to placebo, and 2) Overall Survival (OS).

After analysis of interim results was conducted, the protocol was amended (Amendment 5) to allow participants the option to discontinue placebo in the control arm and to switch to pembrolizumab in the event of documented progressive disease as assessed by central review.",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Saline placebo for pembrolizumab,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of ≥1 new lesions was also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 19 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS is presented., Up to approximately 19 months","Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed by RECIST 1.1. ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 19 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), For participants who demonstrated a confirmed response (Complete Response \[CR\]: Disappearance of all target lesions or Partial Response \[PR\]: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 or death. DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 19 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change infrequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced an AE is presented., Up to approximately 83 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change infrequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE.
