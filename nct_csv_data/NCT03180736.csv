NCT03180736,Comparison of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone With or Without Daratumumab in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated With Lenalidomide and a Proteasome InhibitorDaratumumab/Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone vs Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03180736,EMN14,UNKNOWN,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the addition of daratumumab to pomalidomide and dexamethasone in terms of progression-free survival in subjects with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma.,YES,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone,"Comparison of Progression Free Survival Between Treatment Arms, Comparison of Progression Free Survival between treatment arms (Daratumumab /Pomalidomide /Dexamethasone vs Pomalidomide / Dexamethasone)\[ Time Frame: Assessed monthly from randomization until disease progression (PD) or death whichever occurs first (approximately up to 3 years)\] Progression free survival is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date of the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. PD will be assessed by the investigator based on the analysis of serum and urine protein electrophoresis (sPEP and uPEP), serum and urine immunofixation (sIFE and uIFE), serum free light chain protein (sFLC),corrected serum calcium assessment, imaging and bone marrow assessments as per modified IMWG guidelines., Assessed monthly from randomization until disease progression (PD) or death whichever occurs first (approximately up to 3 years)]","Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of randomized subjects who achieve a best response of PR or better using modified IMWG criteria as their best overall response, Assessed monthly from Randomization until PD, (approximately up to 3 years)]|Depth of Response, To assess the depth of response by analyzing the percentage of patients with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity (\<10-5), considering the patients who have achieved CR or better, and patients with suspected CR/sCR., From randomization to disease progression or subsequent antimyeloma therapy, assessed up to approximately 3 years.|Duration of Response, Duration of response will be restricted to the randomized subjects who achieve a best objective response of PR or better. It is measured from the time, in months, that the criteria for objective response are first met until the date of a progression event (according to the primary definition of PFS)., From informed consent until 30 days after last study treatment, assessed up to approximately 3 years.|Time to Next Therapy, Time to next therapy will be defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date to next anti-neoplastic therapy or death from any cause, whichever comes first., From randomization until the date to next anti-neoplastic therapy or death from any cause, whichever comes first (approximately up to 3 years)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date of death from any cause., From randomization until death from any cause (up to 5 years)|Health-related Quality of Life-Time to Worsening in EORTC QLQ-C30 Scale Scores, Worsening is defined as a decrease in score that is at least half of standard deviation from baseline values, where standard deviation is calculated from the scores at baseline combining both treatment groups., Day 1 of each treatment cycle, at end of treatment, and every 4 weeks post treatment until PD (approximately up to 3 years)|Health-related Quality of Life-Time to Worsening in EQ-5D-5L Utility Score, Worsening is defined as a decrease in score that is at least half of standard deviation from baseline values, where standard deviation is calculated from the scores at baseline combining both treatment groups.

The EQ-5D-5L is a 5 item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating ""health today"", Day 1 of each treatment cycle, at end of treatment, and every 4 weeks post treatment until PD (approximately up to 3 years)|Health-related Quality of Life-Time to Worsening in EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale, Worsening is defined as a decrease in score that is at least half of standard deviation from baseline values, where standard deviation is calculated from the scores at baseline combining both treatment groups.
