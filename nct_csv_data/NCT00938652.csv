NCT00938652,"A Phase 3, Multi-Center Study of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin, With or Without BSI-201, in Patients With ER-, PR-, and Her2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00938652,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this study was to determine the effect on overall survival and progression free survival by adding iniparib (BSI-201/SAR240550) to the combination of gemcitabine/carboplatin in adult patients with triple negative breast cancer (estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative).

Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: gemcitabine/carboplatin|DRUG: Iniparib,"progression free survival, Progression free survival was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of first disease progression (as assessed by Independent Radiologic Review (IRR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria), or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

In the absence disease progression or death, the participant was censored at the date of the last valid tumor assessment performed before the cut-off date., until cut-off date established from deaths rate|Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.

In the absence of confirmation of death, participant was censored at the last date he/she was known to be alive, or at the cut-off date, whichever was earlier., until cut-off date established from deaths rate","Best overall response, Best overall response was defined as the best evaluation observed through the entire treatment period as assessed by Independent Radiologic Review \[IRR\] based on

rate was defined as the percentage of patients with IRR confirmed partial response or complete response prior to disease progression or treatment discontinuation., until treatment discontinuation
