NCT02759614,Compare Bevacizumab in Combination With Erlotinib Versus Erlotinib Alone in NSCLC Patients Activating EGFR Mutations,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02759614,,UNKNOWN,"This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter, Phase III study. Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment group (1:1) through a dynamic randomization process with use of the following stratification factors: sex (female/male), disease stage (stage IIIb vs. stage IV vs. recurrence), and EGFR gene mutation (exon 19 deletion vs. exon 21 L858R).",NO,NSCLC,DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Erlotinib,"Progression-free survival (PFS) by IRC, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone in patients with NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations, as measured by independent review committee assessed progression-free survival using RECIST v1.1, The primary PFS analysis will be performed when approximately 224 PFS events (disease progression or death, whichever occurs first) have occurred, which is estimated to occur at approximately 18 months after enrollment of the last patient.","Progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator using RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone in patients with NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations, as measured by investigators assessed progression-free survival using RECIST v1.1, The primary PFS analysis will be performed when approximately 224 PFS events (disease progression or death, whichever occurs first) have occurred, which is estimated to occur at approximately 18 months after enrollment of the last patient.|Objective response rate (ORR) by IRC using RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone in patients with NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations, as measured by independent review committee assessed objective response rate using RECIST v1.1, baseline overall tumor assessment can be performed up to 28 days prior to randomization.
