NCT01578239,"A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01578239,NETTER-1,COMPLETED,"This was a multicenter, stratified, open, randomized, comparator-controlled, parallel-group phase III study comparing treatment with Lutathera plus best supportive care (30 mg Octreotide LAR) to treatment with high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR in participants with metastasized or locally advanced, inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive, histologically proven midgut carcinoid tumours with progression despite LAR treatment.",YES,Carcinoid Tumor of the Small Bowel|Neuroendocrine Tumour,DRUG: Octreotide LAR|DRUG: 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to documented centrally assessed disease progression, as evaluated by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), or death due to any cause. If a participant had no centrally assessed progression and had not died at the time of the primary endpoint analysis, the participant was regarded as censored in the context of a time to event analysis at the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. Disease progression was determined by objective tumor response status using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1)., From date of randomization until date of radiographic progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first until Primary Analysis cutoff date reached on 24July2015, assessed up to approximately 34 months","Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) was calculated as the proportion of patients with tumour size reduction (sum of partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR)) according to RECIST 1.1., From date of randomization until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first until Primary Analysis cutoff date reached on 24July2015, assessed up to approximately 34 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) prior to the date of the data cut-off, and during the entire study period (i.e. the treatment period plus follow-up)., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause up to final safety cut-off date reached on 18Jan2021, assessed up to approximately 100 months|Rate of Overall Survival (OS), Survival estimates were collected every 12 Months up to 60 Months to compare OS between the two treatment groups., 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months|Time to Tumour Progression (TTP), Time to Tumour Progression (TTP) was defined as the time from randomization to progression centrally assessed. It included patients who dropped out due to toxicity, but omitted patients who died without measured progression (censored to last follow-up date or death date)., From date of randomization until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first until Primary Analysis cutoff date reached on 24July2015, assessed up to approximately 34 months|Duration of Response (DoR), The Duration of Response (DoR) was defined as the time from initially meeting the criteria for response (CR or PR) until the time of progression by RECIST 1.1., From date of randomization until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first until Primary Analysis cutoff date reached on 24July2015, assessed up to approximately 34 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, The distribution of adverse events was done via the analysis of frequencies for Adverse Event (AEs), Serious Adverse Event (SAEs) and Deaths, through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters., From informed consent signature through study completion reached at final safety cutoff date on 18July2021, assessed up to approximately 101 Months|Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire, The Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) was developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) to assess quality of life in cancer patients. It includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality-of-life and financial impact. Subjects respond on a four-point scale from ""not at all"" to ""very much"" for most items. Raw scores are linearly transformed so each score ranged a 0-100, where higher scores indicate worse symptoms (e.g., more severe/worsened) and lower scores indicate less symptoms (e.g., less severe/improvement)., Inclusion (Baseline) (BL), Week 72, Week 120|Change From Baseline in the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Neuroendocrine Carcinoid Module (EORTC QLQ-GINET21), The Quality of Life GI Neuroendocrine Tumor survey (QLQ GINET21) contains a total of 21 items: four single-item assessments relating to muscle and/or bone pain (MBP), body image (BI), information (INF) and sexual functioning (SX), together with 17 items organized into five proposed scales: endocrine symptoms (ED; three items), GI symptoms (GI; five items), treatment-related symptoms (TR; three items), social functioning (SF) and disease-related worries (DRW; three items). The response format of the questionnaire is a four-point Likert scale. Responses are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale using EORTC guidelines, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms., Inclusion (Baseline) (BL), Week 72, Week 120",,Advanced Accelerator Applications,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,231,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AAA-III-01|2011-005049-11|CAAA601A12301,2012-09-06,2015-07-31,2021-01-18,2012-04-16,2017-10-02,2022-04-04,"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Samuel Oschin Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|Stanford Cancer Center, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, 33612, United States|Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation, Chicago, Illinois, 60611-3015, United States|University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|Kettering Medical Center, Kettering, Ohio, 45429, United States|Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Henry-Joyce Cancer Clinic, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Excel Diagnostics and Nuclear Oncology Center, Houston, Texas, 77042, United States|Digestive Oncology, Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Brabant Flamand, 3000, Belgium|Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif Cedex, Ile De France, 94805, France|Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, Midi-Pyrénées, 31100, France|Hotel Dieu/CHU Nantes, Nantes, Pays De La Loire, 44093, France|Hôpital la Timone /CHU Marseille, Marseille, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, 13385, France|Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Lyon, Rhône-Alpes, 69002, France|Hôpital Beaujon AP-HP, Clichy Cedex, 92118, France|Klinikum Rechts Isar, Nuclear Medicine, Munich, Bayern, 81675, Germany|Universitätsmedizin Mainz, Medizinische Klinik I Schwerpunkt Endokrinologie, Mainz, Rheinland-Pfalz, 55131, Germany|Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Bad Berka, Thüringen, 99437, Germany|Charité, Virchow-Klinikum, Gastroentrology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Berlin, 13353, Germany|Istituto Oncologico Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori, Meldola, Emilia-Romagna, 47014, Italy|IEO Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milano, Lombardia, 20141, Italy|Presidio Osp.
