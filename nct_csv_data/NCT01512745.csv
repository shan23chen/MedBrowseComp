NCT01512745,Phase III Study of Apatinib Tablets in the Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01512745,,COMPLETED,"Apatinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and it's anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the maximum tolerable daily dose is 850 mg. The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib can improve progression free survival or overall survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma who failed two lines of chemotherapy.",YES,Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer,DRUG: apatinib|DRUG: placebo,"Progression Free Survival(PFS), Progression free survival of All the Evaluable Participants.Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, in addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
