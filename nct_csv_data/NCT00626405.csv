NCT00626405,Bevacizumab and Temozolomide or Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Stage IV Malignant Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00626405,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether bevacizumab is more effective when given together with temozolomide or paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin in killing malignant melanoma cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving temozolomide together with bevacizumab and to see how well it works compared with giving bevacizumab together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin in treating patients with stage IV malignant melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.",YES,Melanoma (Skin),BIOLOGICAL: bevacizumab|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation|DRUG: temozolomide,"Progression-free Survival at 6 Months, The primary endpoint is the 6 month post registration Progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Progression-free survival time is defined as the time from registration to documentation of disease progression using the RECIST criteria. Patients who died without documentation of disease progression will be considered to have progressed at death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred prior to death. All patients, who meet the eligibility criteria, sign a consent form, and start treatment will be included in the evaluation of the 6 month PFS rate., at 6 months","Tumor Response Rate, Calculated as a Percentage Along With it's 95% Confidence Interval, A confirmed tumor response is defined to be a Complete Response or Partial Response noted

\> Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions

\> Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.

\> Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
