NCT00492752,"A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Study of Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00492752,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of the study is

* Find out if patients receiving Sorafenib will live longer
* Find out if Sorafenib has any effect on patient reported outcomes
* Find out if Sorafenib prevents the growth or shrinks liver tumors and / or their metastases
* Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with liver cancer",YES,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)|DRUG: Placebo","Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization","Time to Symptomatic Progression (TTSP), Time to Symptomatic Progression (TTSP) was defined as the time from date of randomization to symptomatic progression. Subjects without symptomatic progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization|Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the time from date of randomization to radiologically documented disease progression. Subjects without progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluationã€‚, From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization|Disease Control, Disease Control (DC) was defined as the total number of subjects whose best response was not Progressive Disease (PD: an increase in the sum of tumor lesions sizes) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (= total number of Complete Response (CR: disappearance of tumor lesions) + total number of Partial Response (PR: a decrease of at least 30% in the sum of tumor lesion sizes) + total number of Stable Disease (SD: steady state of disease); CR, PR, or SD had to be maintained for at least 28 days from the first demonstration of that rating)., From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization|Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Hepatobiliary Symptom Index-8 (FHSI-8) Score From Baseline to Cycle 1 and Cycle 3, The FHSI-8 questionnaire was completed at baseline and every 3 weeks during treatment and at the end of treatment visit only for subjects who withdrew for reasons other than symptomatic progression. Patient reported outcome was measured using the FHSI-8 score changes from baseline throughout the study period. FHSI-8 assesses hepatobiliary cancer symptoms with total score ranges from 0 to 32 (0 = the best quality of life; 32 = the worst quality of life with severe symptoms).., Baseline up to Cycle 1 and Cycle 3. From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization|Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) Score From Baseline to Cycle 3 and End of Treatment, The FACT-Hep questionnaire was also completed to assess patient reported outcome. The FACT-Hep assesses hepatobiliary cancer-related quality of life. FACT-Hep total score ranges from 0 to 180 (0=All questions answered ""Not at all""; 180=All questions answered ""Very much"")., Baseline up to Cycle 3 and end of treatment. From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization|Number of Participants With Different Tumor Response, Tumor Response (= Best Overall Response) of a subject was defined as the best tumor response (confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of tumor lesions), confirmed\* Partial Response (PR: a decrease of at least 30% in the sum of tumor lesion sizes), Stable Disease (SD: steady state of disease), or Progressive Disease (PD: an increase in the sum of tumor lesions sizes)) observed during trial period assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria., From randomization/start of treatment of the first subject until approximately 23 months after randomization when the subjects on placebo were offered the option to crossover to sorafenib treatment|Duration of Response, Duration of Response was defined as the time from date of first response (Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)) to the date when Progressive Disease (PD) is first documented, or to the date of death, whichever occurs first. Subjects still having CR or PR at the time of analysis were censored at their last tumor assessment., From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization|Time to Response, Time to Response (TTR) for subjects who achieved a response (Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) ) was defined as the time from date of randomization to the earliest date that the response was first documented., From randomization of the first subject until the data cut-off date approximately 23 months after start of randomization|Area Under the Curve From Time 0 to 12 Hours Post-dose (AUC 0-12) After 21 Days of Sorafenib Treatment, The AUC is a measure of systemic drug exposure, which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample. A plot of concentration vs time after dosing is created, and the area under this curve is calculated by standard methods (eg, trapezoidal rule) to provide a measure of how much drug was in the bloodstream following dosing., PK assessments made at following times: pre-dose, 1 h, 2h, 4h, 8h,and 12h after at least 21 consecutive doses during Cycle 1|Normalized Area Under the Curve (AUC Norm) After 21 Days of Sorafenib Treatment, The AUC is a measure of systemic drug exposure, which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample. A plot of concentration vs time after dosing is created, and the area under this curve is calculated by standard methods (eg, trapezoidal rule) to provide a measure of how much drug was in the bloodstream following dosing., PK assessments made at following times: pre-dose, 1 h, 2h, 4h, 8h,and 12h after at least 21 consecutive doses during Cycle 1|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) After 21 Days of Sorafenib Treatment, Cmax refers to the highest plasma concentration of drug reached after dosing. It is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples after dosing, and analyzing them for drug content by a sensitive and specific analytical method. The highest measured concentration is referred to as the Cmax., PK assessments made at following times: pre-dose, 1 h, 2h, 4h, 8h,and 12h after at least 21 consecutive doses during Cycle 1|Normalized Maximum Concentration (Cmaxnorm) After 21 Days of Sorafenib Treatment, Cmaxnorm refers to the maximum plasma concentration of Sorafenib corrected for dose and body weight (Cmaxnorm = Cmax/(mg/kg))., PK assessments made at following times: pre-dose, 1 h, 2h, 4h, 8h,and 12h after at least 21 consecutive doses during Cycle 1|Time of Maximum Concentration (Tmax) After 21 Days of Sorafenib Treatment, Tmax refers to the time after dosing when a drug attains its maximum concentration in the blood. It is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples at various times after dosing, and measuring them for drug content. The time corresponding to the highest measurable concentration (Cmax) is referred to as Tmax., PK assessments made at following times: pre-dose, 1 h, 2h, 4h, 8h,and 12h after at least 21 consecutive doses during Cycle 1",,Bayer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,226,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",11849,2005-10,2007-03,2009-07,2007-06-27,2011-01-13,2014-04-16,"Hefei, Anhui, 230022, China|Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China|Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China|Wuhan, Hubei, 430030, China|Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210003, China|Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210009, China|Dalian, Liaoning, 116011, China|Dalian, Liaoning, 116027, China|Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310016, China|Beijing, 100021, China|Beijing, 100039, China|Chongqing, 400038, China|Shanghai, 200003, China|Shanghai, 200032, China|Tianjin, China|Seoul, Seoul Teugbyeolsi, 152-703, Korea, Republic of|Daegu, 702-701, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|Changhua, 500, Taiwan|Tainan, 736, Taiwan|Taipei, 10016, Taiwan|Taipei, 251, Taiwan|Taoyuan, 333, Taiwan",
