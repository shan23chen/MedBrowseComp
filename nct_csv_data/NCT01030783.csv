NCT01030783,A Study to Compare Tivozanib (AV-951) to Sorafenib in Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01030783,TIVO-1,COMPLETED,"This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center, parallel-arm trial comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with advanced RCC. The study is designed to compare the PFS, OS, ORR, DR, safety and tolerability, and kidney specific symptoms/health outcome measurements of tivozanib and sorafenib.",YES,Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,DRUG: tivozanib (AV-951)|DRUG: Sorafenib,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) of Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression (progressive disease) or death due to any reasons whichever comes first. Disease progression per RECIST 1.0 criteria is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first. Disease progression was assessed every 8 weeks.","Overall Survival (OS) of Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time will be censored at the last date the subject is known to be alive. Subjects lacking data beyond randomization will have their survival times censored on the date of randomization., Date of randomization to date of death|Objective Response Rate (ORR) of Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects who have at least a 30% reduction in the sum of diameters per RECIST (Version 1.0)., Every 8 weeks from date of randomization until disease progression|Duration of Response (DR) of Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Duration of response (DR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response to the first documentation of tumor progression per RECIST 1.0 or to death due to any cause., Assessed every 8 weeks from date of randomization until date of progression|Safety and Tolerability of Tivozanib and Sorafenib, Dose reductions and interruptions were allowed for subjects taking tivozanib or sorafenib. Any modification of study drug administration, and the reason for such action, was clearly noted on the subject's eCRF., From start of treatment therapy to completion of treatment therapy, an average of 11 months|To Compare Kidney-specific Symptoms and Health Outcome Measurements in Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, The Disease Related Symptom Scale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Advanced Kidney Cancer Symptom Index (FKSI-DRS) measured kidney specific symptoms on a 0-36 scale, with lower scores corresponding to worse overall QOL and higher scores corresponding to better overall QOL. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) measured general wellbeing scored on a 0-108 scale, with lower scores corresponding to worse overall QOL and higher scores corresponding to better overall QOL. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) measured patient health related quality of life scored on a 0-1 scale, with 0 being worse health state and 1 being perfect health state. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Visual Analog Scales (EQ-5D VAS) measured patient health related quality of life on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best. These scales were self-administered by patients at the start of the visit., At Day 1 of each 28 day cycle throughout the course of the study, for an average of 11 months per subject|Pharmacokinetics (Serum Concentrations) of Tivozanib, Samples for tivozanib serum concentrations will be collected at the following time points: Cycle 1, Day 1 (prior to dosing), Cycle 1, Day 15 (prior to dosing), Cycle 2, Day 1 (prior to dosing), and Cycle 2, Day 22-28. The serum concentrations of tivozanib were tabulated for individual subjects and summarized by nominal time using standard descriptive statistics (concentrations presented in ng/mL)., Cycle 1, Day 1 (prior to dosing), Cycle 1, Day 15 (prior to dosing), Cycle 2, Day 1 (prior to dosing), and Cycle 2, Day 22-28",,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,517,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AV-951-09-301,2009-12,2012-07,2013-06,2009-12-11,2019-10-28,2019-10-28,"Site 185, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Site 180, Gainesville, Florida, 32625, United States|Site 184, Orlando, Florida, 32806, United States|Site 182, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States|Site 186, New York, New York, 10065, United States|Site 187, Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|Site 102, Sante Fe, 3077, Argentina|Site 403, Plovdiv, 4004, Bulgaria|Site 404, Sofia, 1431, Bulgaria|Site 400, Sofia, 1756, Bulgaria|Site 401, Varna, 9002, Bulgaria|Site 402, Veliko Tarnovo, 5000, Bulgaria|Site 110, Montréal, Quebec, H2X 1N8, Canada|Site 121, La Reina, Santiago De Chile, 7510009, Chile|Site 122, Santiago, 8320000, Chile|Site 123, Temuco, 4810469, Chile|Site 411, Prague 8, 180 81, Czechia|Site 130, Marseille, 13009, France|Site 133, Saint Herblain Cedex, 44805, France|Site 423, Budapest, H-1108, Hungary|Site 421, Kaposvár, H-7400, Hungary|Site 422, Pécs, H-7624, Hungary|Site 424, Szombathely, H-9700, Hungary|Site 157, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, 500004, India|Site 190, Patna, Bihar, 801505, India|Site 156, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380015, India|Site 151, Nashik, Maharashtra, 422005, India|Site 153, Pune, Maharashtra, 411004, India|Site 159, Pune, Maharashtra, 411005, India|Site 191, Jaipur, Rajasthan, 302004, India|Site 155, Jaipur, Rajasthan, 302013, India|Site 152, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, 632004, India|Site 158, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226003, India|Site 150, Kolkata, West Bengal, 700054, India|Site 154, Delhi, 110085, India|Site 160, Arezzo, 52100, Italy|Site 161, Pavia, 27100, Italy|Site 162, Roma, 00152, Italy|Site 432, Bialystok, 15-027, Poland|Site 434, Bydgoszcz, 85-168, Poland|Site 431, Gdansk, 80-952, Poland|Site 435, Olsztyn, 10-228, Poland|Site 433, Poznan, 61-878, Poland|Site 430, Warsaw, 02-781, Poland|Site 436, Warsaw, 04-141, Poland|Site 444, Brasov, 500085, Romania|Site 441, Bucharest, 022328, Romania|Site 440, Bucharest, 041345, Romania|Site 443, Bucharest, 050659, Romania|Site 442, Timisoara, 300239, Romania|Site 459, Ufa, Republic Of Bashkortostan, 450054, Russian Federation|Site 451, Chelyabinsk, 454087, Russian Federation|Site 455, Ekaterinburg, 620102, Russian Federation|Site 468, Ioshkar Ola, 424037, Russian Federation|Site 452, Kazan, 420029, Russian Federation|Site 454, Moscow, 105077, Russian Federation|Site 453, Moscow, 115478, Russian Federation|Site 458, Moscow, 115478, Russian Federation|Site 460, Moscow, 115478, Russian Federation|Site 461, Moscow, 115478, Russian Federation|Site 462, Moscow, 125284, Russian Federation|Site 450, Nizhny Novgorod, 603109, Russian Federation|Site 456, Obninsk, 249036, Russian Federation|Site 467, Omsk, 644013, Russian Federation|Site 463, Pyatigorsk, 357500, Russian Federation|Site 457, Rostov-on-Don, 344022, Russian Federation|Site 466, St. Petersburg, 193312, Russian Federation|Site 465, St. Petersburg, 198255, Russian Federation|Site 464, Yaroslavi, 150054, Russian Federation|Site 480, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia|Site 481, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia|Site 482, Belgrade, 11000, Serbia|Site 483, Nis, 18000, Serbia|Site 484, Sremska Kamenica, 21204, Serbia|Site 491, Chernihiv, 14029, Ukraine|Site 492, Dniproperovsk, 49102, Ukraine|Site 498, Dnipropetrovsk, 49005, Ukraine|Site 493, Donetsk, 83092, Ukraine|Site 496, Donetsk, 83092, Ukraine|Site 490, Ivano-Frankivsk, 76000, Ukraine|Site 494, Kharkiv, 61037, Ukraine|Site 497, Uzhhorod, 88014, Ukraine|Site 495, Zaporizhia, 69600, Ukraine|Site 170, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, United Kingdom|Site 173, Ipswich, IP4 5WW, United Kingdom|Site 172, Leicester, LE1 5WW, United Kingdom",
