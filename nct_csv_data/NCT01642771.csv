NCT01642771,Comparative Study on Two Post-operative Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimens for Treating Triple-negative Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01642771,,UNKNOWN,"Recent clinical studies showed that triple-negative breast cancer patients (ER-/PR-/HER2-) may benefit more from Capecitabine chemotherapy. However, the optimum post-operative adjuvant Capecitabine chemotherapy regimen has not been determined for Chinese population with triple-negative breast cancer. Thus it's necessary to conduct a multi-center Phase III clinical trial to verify efficacy and safety of Capecitabine in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. In this study, a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center Phase III clinical study was conducted to compare efficacy and safety of sequential Docetaxel followed by Fluorouracil/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (FEC) and sequential Docetaxel and Capecitabine followed by Capecitabine/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (XEC) as post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer in Chinese population.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: 5-Fu/epirubicin/CTX following Docetaxel|DRUG: Docetaxel/capecitabine followed by XEC,"5-year disease free survival, Including local relapse, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, second primary cancer or death from any cause, 5 year after the completion of chemotherapy","Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, Safety will be evaluated based on adverse events observed and the number of participants with adverse events. Blood biological tests shall also be conducted for further examination., Within 5 years after the completion of chemotherapy|FACT-B scale scores as a Measure of living quality, FACT-B scale scores of participants would be assessed to reflect their living quality., Baseline, Week 0|5-year relapse free survival, distant disease free survival and overall survival as measures of efficacy, Disease relapse shall be considered as the endpoint of relapse free survival and the period between surgery and disease relapse shall be recorded as a measure of efficacy.

Also disease distant metastasis shall be considered as the endpoint of distant disease free survival and the period between surgery and Disease distant metastasis shall be recorded as a measure of efficacy., Within 5 years after the completion of chemotherapy|FACT-B scale scores as a Measure of living quality, FACT-B scale scores of participants would be assessed to reflect their living quality., Week 9|FACT-B scale scores as a Measure of living quality, FACT-B scale scores of participants would be assessed to reflect their living quality., Week 18",,China Breast Cancer Clinical Study Group,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,636,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EBC protocol 1.1,2012-06,2019-12,2020-05,2012-07-17,,2017-04-19,"Cancer Institute and Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, 100021, China|Pekingn Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100032, China|Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, Beijing, 100050, China|PLA 307 Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100071, China|The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing, Beijing, 100853, China|The First Affi liated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400016, China|South West Hospital, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400038, China|Gansu Cancer Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, 730050, China|Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China|Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China|Cancer Hospital of Shantou Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, 515041, China|Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550002, China|The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, 050011, China|The second affiliated hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150001, China|The third affiliated hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150040, China|Henan cancer hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou university, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450008, China|Hubei General Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, 430070, China|Xiangya Hospital Central-south University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, China|Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 210000, China|Jiangsu Province Hospital, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 210029, China|The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215004, China|Third Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330009, China|Jinlin Cancer Hospital & Institute, Changchun, Jilin, 130012, China|The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China|The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110001, China|Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200032, China|Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200032, China|Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200040, China|Shanghai 6th People's Hospital, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200233, China|Changhai Hospital of Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200433, China|Shanxi Cancer Hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi, 030013, China|Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, 710004, China|Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, Tianjin, 300060, China|Xinjiang Cancer Hospital, Wulumuqi, Xinjiang, 830000, China|Zhejiang First Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China|Second Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310009, China|The First Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325000, China",
