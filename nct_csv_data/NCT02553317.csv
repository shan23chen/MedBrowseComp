NCT02553317,Phase III Trial With Caplacizumab in Patients With Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02553317,HERCULES,COMPLETED,"The study was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of caplacizumab in more rapidly restoring normal platelet counts as measure of prevention of further microvascular thrombosis",YES,Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,BIOLOGICAL: Caplacizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo,"Time to Platelet Count Response, Platelet count response was defined as initial platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL with subsequent stop of daily PE within 5 days. It refers to the first time both conditions, platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL and the stop of daily PE within 5 days, were met., Only data from the DB daily PE period (median = 5 days) up to the cut-off were used. The cut-off point was defined by whichever occured first: 1) 45 days of daily PE after start of study drug, 2) stop of daily PE, 3) stop of study drug (median = 34 days)","Number and Percentage of Subjects With TTP-Related Death, Recurrence of TTP, or a Major Thromboembolic Event During the Study Drug Treatment Period, Number and percentage of subjects with TTP-related death, a recurrence of TTP, or at least one treatment-emergent major thromboembolic event during the study drug treatment period (i.e., first key secondary endpoint)., The study drug treatment period, a median (min, max) of 36 (2, 82) days. For both treatment groups, only events that occurred prior to a switch to open-label caplacizumab were evaluated for this analysis.|Number and Percentage of Subjects With a Recurrence of TTP in the Overall Study Period, Number and percentage of subjects with a recurrence of TTP during the Overall Study Period (i.e., including follow-up \[FU\]) (i.e., second key secondary endpoint)., The overall study period (covers both the overall treatment period and the follow-up period), a median (min, max) of 65 (2, 110) days.|Number and Percentage of Subjects With Refractory Disease, Number and percentage of subjects with refractory TTP, defined as absence of platelet count doubling after 4 days of standard treatment, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \> upper limit of normal (ULN) (i.e., third key secondary endpoint)., The study drug treatment period, a median (min, max) of 36 (2, 82) days.|Time to Normalization of Organ Damage Marker Levels, Time to first normalization of LDH, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and serum creatinine was defined as: first time of LDH ≤ ULN and cTnI ≤ ULN and serum creatinine ≤ ULN - time of first i.v. loading dose of study drug after randomization + 1 minute. Subjects in either initial treatment group who switched to open-label caplacizumab before having reached the endpoint were censored at time of switch.

Of note, the key secondary endpoints were hierarchically ordered to allow statistical testing for these endpoints at the same nominal significance level of 5% without adjustment, as long as the tests occurred in the pre-defined sequential order, and given that all null hypotheses tested for endpoints with a higher rank (including the primary endpoint) were rejected. No confirmatory testing was done for this fourth key secondary endpoint, as the statistical test was not significant for the proportion of subjects with refractory disease (i.e., the third key secondary endpoint)., Overall study period, a median (min, max) of 65 (2, 110) days. For both treatment groups, normalizations occurring during the open-label period were not evaluated in this analysis.","Number of Days of Plasma Exchange, The number of days of PE during the overall study drug treatment period, including the number of days of PE during the open-label study drug treatment period. Data were analyzed according to the initial treatment allocation (both before and after switch to open-label caplacizumab)., Overall study drug treatment period, a median (min, max) of 36 (2, 82) days.|Total Volume of Plasma Exchange, The total volume of PE during the overall study drug treatment period, including the total volume of PE during the open-label study drug treatment period. Data were analyzed according to the initial treatment allocation (both before and after switch to open-label caplacizumab)., Overall study drug treatment period, a median (min, max) of 36 (2, 82) days.|Number of Days in Intensive Care Unit, The number of days in intensive care unit (ICU) during the overall study drug treatment period, including the number of days in ICU during the open-label study drug treatment period. Data were analyzed according to the initial treatment allocation (both before and after switch to open-label caplacizumab)., Overall study drug treatment period, a median (min, max) of 36 (2, 82) days.|Number of Days in Hospital, The number of days in hospital during the overall study drug treatment period, including the number of days in hospital during the open-label study drug treatment period. Data were analyzed according to the initial treatment allocation (both before and after switch to open-label caplacizumab)., Overall study drug treatment period, a median (min, max) of 36 (2, 82) days.","Ablynx, a Sanofi company",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,145,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ALX0681-C301|2015-001098-42,2015-11,2017-08,2017-08,2015-09-17,2019-05-22,2023-04-05,"Investigator Site, Birmingham, Alabama, 35249, United States|Investigator Site, Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|Investigator Site, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Investigator Site, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Investigator Site, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Investigator Site, Rochester, New York, 14642, United States|Investigator Site, Rochester, New York, 55905, United States|Investigator Site, Valhalla, New York, 10595, United States|Investigator Site, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27599, United States|Investigator Site, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|Investigator Site, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27157, United States|Investigator SIte, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195, United States|Investigator Site, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States|Investigator Site, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73104, United States|Investigator Site, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States|Investigator Site, Charleston, South Carolina, 29425, United States|Investigator Site, Greenville, South Carolina, 27834, United States|Investigator Site, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Investigator Site, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84112, United States|Investigator Site, Brisbane, Australia|Investigator Site 1, Melbourne, Australia|Investigator Site 2, Melbourne, Australia|Investigator Site 3, Melbourne, Australia|Investigator Site 4, Melbourne, Australia|Investigator Site 5, Melbourne, Australia|Investigator Site, Perth, Australia|Investigator Site 1, Sydney, Australia|Investigator Site 2, Sydney, Australia|Investigator Site, Vienna, Austria|Investigator Site, Antwerp, Belgium|Investigator Site, Brussels, Belgium|Investigator Site, Haine-Saint-Paul, Belgium|Investigator Site, La Louviere, Belgium|Investigator Site, Leuven, Belgium|Invesigator Site, Montreal, Quebec, Canada|Investigator Site, London, Canada|Investigator Site, Toronto, Canada|Investigator Site, Brno, Czechia|Investigator Site, Hradec Kralove, Czechia|Investigator Site, Olomouc, Czechia|Investigator Site, Ostrava-Poruba, Czechia|Investigator Site, Caen, France|Investigator Site, Lille, France|Investigator Site, Marseille, France|Investigator Site, Nantes, France|Investigator Site 1, Paris, France|Investigator Site 2, Paris, France|Investigator Site 3, Paris, France|Investigator Site 4, Paris, France|Investigator site 5, Paris, France|Investigator Site, Rouen, France|Investigator Site, Salouel, France|Investigator site 1, Dresden, Germany|Investigator site 2, Dresden, Germany|Investigator site, Erlangen, Germany|Investigator site, Goppingen, Germany|Investigator site, Kiel, Germany|Investigator site, Köln, Germany|Investigator site, Leipzig, Germany|Investigator site, Würzburg, Germany|Investigator Site 1, Budapest, Hungary|Investigator Site 2, Budapest, Hungary|Investigator Site, Debrecen, Hungary|Investigator Site 1, Be'er Ya'aqov, Israel|Investigator Site 2, Be'er Ya'aqov, Israel|Investigator Site, Haifa, Israel|Investigator Site 1, Jerusalem, Israel|Investigator Site 2, Jerusalem, Israel|Investigator Site, Nahariya, Israel|Investigator Site, Petah Tiqva, Israel|Investigator Site, Tel Aviv, Israel|Investigator Site, Catania, Italy|Investigator Site 1, Milan, Italy|Investigator Site 2, Milan, Italy|Investigator Site, Pesaro, Italy|Investigator Site, Rome, Italy|Investigator Site, Vicenza, Italy|Investigator Site, Amersfoort, Netherlands|Investigator Site, Leiden, Netherlands|Investigator Site, Rotterdam, Netherlands|Investigator Site, Veldhoven, Netherlands|Investigator Site 1, Barcelona, Spain|Investigator Site 2, Barcelona, Spain|Investigator Site, Madrid, Spain|Investigator Site, Sevilla, Spain|Investigator Site 1, Valencia, Spain|Investigator Site 2, Valencia, Spain|Investigator site 3, Valencia, Spain|Investigator Site, Bern, Switzerland|Investigator Site, Zurich, Switzerland|Investigator Site, Ankara, Turkey|Investigator Site 1, Denizli, Turkey|Investigator Site 2, Denizli, Turkey|Investigator site 3, Denizli, Turkey|Investigator Site, Istanbul, Turkey|Investigator Site, Kayseri, Turkey|Investigator Site, Trabzon, Turkey|Investigator Site, Bristol, United Kingdom|Investigator Site, Liverpool, United Kingdom|Investigator Site 1, London, United Kingdom|Investigator Site 2, London, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT02553317/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT02553317/SAP_001.pdf"
