NCT01093235,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01093235,,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, fluorouracil, epirubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with or without bevacizumab is more effective in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy works compared with giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer.",NO,Breast Cancer|Cardiac Toxicity|Perioperative/Postoperative Complications,BIOLOGICAL: bevacizumab|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: epirubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: fluorouracil|PROCEDURE: assessment of therapy complications|PROCEDURE: neoadjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery,Complete pathological response rates (tumor and lymph nodes),"Disease-free survival|Overall survival|Pathological complete response rate in breast alone|Radiological response after 3 and 6 courses of chemotherapy|Rate of breast conservation|Toxicities, including cardiac safety and surgical complications (wound healing, bleeding, and thrombosis)|Quality of life",,Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,800,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000668530|CRCA-CCTC-WCTU-ARTemis|ISRCTN68502941|EUDRACT-2008-002322-11|EU-21017|MREC-08/H1102/104,2009-04,2012-04,,2010-03-25,,2010-03-25,"Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England, CB2 2QQ, United Kingdom",
