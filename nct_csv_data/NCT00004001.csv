NCT00004001,"S9916, Combination Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00004001,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy and hormone therapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether estramustine plus docetaxel is more effective than mitoxantrone plus prednisone for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of estramustine plus docetaxel with that of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.",NO,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: estramustine|DRUG: mitoxantrone|DRUG: prednisone,"Compare overall survival in the two study arms, Measured from date of registration to date of death due to any cause, up to 4 years","Compare progression-free survival between two study arms, Measured from date of registration to date of first observation of progression disease, or death due to any cause, up to 4 years|Compare Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response between two study arms, A confirmed partial response of non-measurable disease was defined as a reduction by more than 50% over baseline in two or more Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) measurements obtained at least four weeks apart, with no evidence of disease progression on imaging. Progressive disease was defined as a 25% increase in the serum PSA level - to at least 5 ng per milliliter - over the last preregistration measurement, with confirmation of the increase at least four weeks later. For patients with a decrease in serum PSA levels during the trial, progressive disease was defined as a confirmed increase of 25%, to at least 5 ng per milliliter over the nadir., up to 4 years or time of disease progression|Compare objective responses between two study arms, Objective responses were defined on the basis of the sum of bi-dimensional measurements of metastatic lesions. Confirmed objective responses required a follow-up scan (a minimum of four weeks later) that demonstrated a continued response. Progression was defined by one of the following: a 50 percent increase or an increase of 10 cm\^2, whichever was smaller, in the sum of measurements of metastatic lesions over the sum at baseline; a clear worsening of nonmeasurable disease; reappearance of any lesion that had disappeared; appearance of any new lesion; or death., up to 12 cycles of treatment ( 1cycle = 21 days)|Compare toxicities between the two study arms, up to 12 cycles of treatment (1 cycle = 21 days)",,SWOG Cancer Research Network,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Cancer and Leukemia Group B|North Central Cancer Treatment Group,MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,770,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000067211|S9916|U10CA032102,1999-10,2006-07,2007-01,2003-01-27,,2014-02-25,"CCOP - Scottsdale Oncology Program, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259-5404, United States|Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, 32224, United States|CCOP - Illinois Oncology Research Association, Peoria, Illinois, 61602, United States|CCOP - Carle Cancer Center, Urbana, Illinois, 61801, United States|CCOP - Cedar Rapids Oncology Project, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 52403-1206, United States|CCOP - Iowa Oncology Research Association, Des Moines, Iowa, 50309-1016, United States|Siouxland Hematology-Oncology, Sioux City, Iowa, 51101-1733, United States|Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|CentraCare Health Plaza, Saint Cloud, Minnesota, 56303, United States|CCOP - Missouri Valley Cancer Consortium, Omaha, Nebraska, 68106, United States|Medcenter One Health System, Bismarck, North Dakota, 58501, United States|CCOP - Merit Care Hospital, Fargo, North Dakota, 58122, United States|Altru Health System, Grand Forks, North Dakota, 58201, United States|CCOP - Geisinger Clinic and Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17822-2001, United States|Rapid City Regional Hospital, Rapid City, South Dakota, 57709, United States|CCOP - Sioux Community Cancer Consortium, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 57104, United States",
