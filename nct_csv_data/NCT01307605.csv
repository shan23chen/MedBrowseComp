NCT01307605,Rituximab With or Without Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01307605,,TERMINATED,"RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer cell growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It is not yet known whether rituximab is more effective when given alone or together with lenalidomide in treating patients with follicular lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying rituximab to see how well it works compared with giving rituximab together with lenalidomide in treating patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma.",NO,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab|DRUG: lenalidomide,"Complete response (CR), The evaluation of CR is outlined in Appendix 1 Criteria for Evaluation of Response in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma., at week 23","Best overall response (OR), OR is defined as either:

* the disappearance of all evidence of disease (CR or CRu)
* the regression of measurable disease with no new sites (PR), within 24 weeks|Best Overall response (OR), OR is defined as either:

* the disappearance of all evidence of disease (CR or CRu)
* the regression of measurable disease with no new sites (PR), within 12 weeks|Progression-free survival, PFS will be calculated from randomization until the first event of interest:

* disease progression or relapse according to criteria of Cheson et a.l 1999
* death from any cause, until disease progression, for up to 10 years after randomization|Time to first off-trial anti-lymphoma therapy, This will be calculated from randomization until the start of the first off-trial anti-lymphoma treatment.

Patients not receiving any off-trial anti-lymphoma treatment will be censored at the last follow-up visit., until off-trial therapy administration, for up to 10 years after randomization|Overall survival, OS will be calculated from randomization until death. Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive., every 6 months for up to 10 years after randomization|Adverse events, including laboratory abnormality assessments and vital signs, This will be evaluated using the NCI CTCAE v4.0, from inclusion until 30 days after treatment discontinuation",,Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,154,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,SAKK 35/10|SWS-SAKK-35-10|2010-021253-39|CELGENE-SWS-SAKK-35/10,2011-02-09,2014-06-20,2023-01-25,2011-03-03,,2023-06-27,"Haukeland Hospital - University of Bergen, Bergen, N-5021, Norway|Sorlandet Sykehus HF Kristiansand, Kristiansand, 4604, Norway|Ullevaal University Hospital, Oslo, 0424, Norway|Helse Stavanger HF, Stavanger, 4068, Norway|University Hospital of North Norway - Tromso, Tromso, 9038, Norway|St. Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim, 7006, Norway|Sahlgrenska University Hospital, GÃ¶teborg, S-413 45, Sweden|University Hospital of Linkoping, Linkoping, S-581 85, Sweden|Sunderbyn Hospital, Lulea, 95128, Sweden|Lund University Hospital, Lund, SE-22185, Sweden|Karolinska University Hospital - Huddinge, Stockholm, S-141 86, Sweden|Karolinska University Hospital - Solna, Stockholm, S-171 76, Sweden|Sundsvall Hospital, Sundsvall, 85186, Sweden|Norrlands University Hospital, Umea, S-90185, Sweden|Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, SE-75185, Sweden|Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, 5001, Switzerland|Kantonsspital Baden, Baden, 5404, Switzerland|Saint Claraspital AG, Basel, 4016, Switzerland|Universitaetsspital-Basel, Basel, 4031, Switzerland|Istituto Oncologico della Svizzera Italiana - Ospedale San Giovanni, Bellinzona, 6500, Switzerland|Inselspital Bern, Bern, 3010, Switzerland|Spitalzentrum Oberwallis - Brig, Brig, 3900, Switzerland|Kantonsspital Bruderholz, Bruderholz, 4101, Switzerland|Kantonsspital Graubuenden, Chur, 7000, Switzerland|University Hospital, Geneva, 1211, Switzerland|Kantonsspital Liestal, Liestal, 4410, Switzerland|Kantonsspital Olten, Olten, 4600, Switzerland|Kantonsspital - St. Gallen, St. Gallen, 9007, Switzerland|Regionalspital, Thun, 3600, Switzerland|Kantonsspital Winterthur, Winterthur, 8401, Switzerland|Klinik Hirslanden, Zurich, 8032, Switzerland|City Hospital Triemli, Zurich, 8063, Switzerland|UniversitaetsSpital Zuerich, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland",
