CR=disappearance of all target lesions i.e., any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeters (mm). PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. SD=neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum during the study. PD=at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum during the study (nadir) with inclusion of baseline. Only participants with measurable disease at baseline were included in the analysis. 1 Cycle=21 days. The percentages have been rounded off to first decimal point., At surgery (Cycle 4 Days 22-35)|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response (CR or PR) During Cycles 1-4, According to RECIST Version 1.1, An objective response was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a CR or PR as the best tumor response during the neoadjuvant period (that is, during Cycles 1-4 prior to surgery), as determined by the investigator on the basis of RECIST version 1.1. CR=disappearance of all target lesions i.e., any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. No confirmation was required for objective response.

EFS=time from randomization to first documentation of one of the following events: PD (before surgery) as determined by investigator with RECIST v1.1. PD=at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum during the study (nadir) with inclusion of baseline. Any evidence of contralateral disease in situ was not identified as PD; Disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral) after surgery; Death from any cause. After treatment completion/discontinuation, follow-up data was collected every 3 months for 1 year \& then every 6 months thereafter, until disease progression/recurrence or until 5 years after randomization of last participant, whichever occurred first. Participants without an EFS event at time of analysis were censored as of the date they were last known to be alive \& event-free., From Baseline to EFS event or date last known to be alive and event-free at 1, 3, and 5 years|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of the Percentage of Participants Event-Free for Disease-Free Survival (DFS) at 1, 3, and 5 Years, Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate the percentage of participants who were event-free for DFS at 1, 3 and 5 years. DFS = time from first date of no disease (i.e., date of surgery) to first documentation of one of the following events: Disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral) after surgery or death from any cause. After treatment completion/discontinuation, follow-up data was collected every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter, until disease progression or recurrence or until 5 years after randomization of the last participant, whichever occurred first. Participants were considered to be disease-free if they underwent surgery and no recurrence of disease was reported thereafter. Data from participants who did not have an event at analysis were censored as of the date they were last known to be alive and event-free., From surgery (Cycle 4: Days 22-35) to DFS event or date last known to be alive and event-free at 1, 3, and 5 years|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of the Percentage of Participants Event-Free for Overall Survival (OS) at 1, 3, and 5 Years, Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate the percentage of participants who were event-free for OS at 1, 3 and 5 years. OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. After treatment completion/discontinuation, follow-up data was collected every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter, until disease progression or recurrence or until 5 years after randomization of the last participant, whichever occurred first.

An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant who is administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of the causal attribution. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during the study were also considered as adverse events. The neoadjuvant treatment period began after randomization upon receiving the first dose of any of the neoadjuvant study medications and ended before receiving the first dose of adjuvant study treatment. The duration of one treatment cycle is 21 days. The percentages have been rounded off to first decimal point., Baseline up to end of Cycle 4 (1 cycle = 21 days)|Percentage of Participants With at Least One AE During the Adjuvant Treatment Period, Percentage of participants who experienced at least one adverse event during the adjuvant period is reported here.
