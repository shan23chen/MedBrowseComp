NCT01274338,Ipilimumab or High-Dose Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage III-IV Melanoma That Has Been Removed by Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01274338,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies ipilimumab to see how well it works compared to high-dose interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with high-risk stage III-IV melanoma that has been removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of melanoma and other cancers. It is not yet known whether ipilimumab is more effective than interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with melanoma.",YES,Melanoma of Unknown Primary|Recurrent Melanoma|Stage IIIB Cutaneous Melanoma AJCC v7|Stage IIIC Cutaneous Melanoma AJCC v7|Stage IV Cutaneous Melanoma AJCC v6 and v7,BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b,"Recurrence-free Survival (RFS; Arm B [HDI] vs. Arm C [LIP]), Recurrence-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to recurrence or death, whichever occurs first.
