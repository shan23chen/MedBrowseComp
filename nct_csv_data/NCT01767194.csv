NCT01767194,Irinotecan Hydrochloride and Temozolomide With Temsirolimus or Dinutuximab in Treating Younger Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Neuroblastoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01767194,,COMPLETED,"This randomized phase II trial studies how well irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide with temsirolimus or dinutuximab work in treating younger patients with neuroblastoma that has returned or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide together with temsirolimus or dinutuximab is more effective in treating neuroblastoma.",YES,Ganglioneuroblastoma|Recurrent Neuroblastoma,BIOLOGICAL: Dinutuximab|DRUG: Irinotecan Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|BIOLOGICAL: Sargramostim|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Temsirolimus,"Percentage of Randomized Patients Who Are Responders, The percentage of patients who are responders will be tabulated, including a 95% confidence interval on the response rate. Responders are defined as patients who achieve a best overall response of complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) per the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC). Per INRC: CR= Disappearance of all target lesions. No evidence of tumor at any site; VGPR= \>90% decrease of the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions. All pre-existing bone lesions with CR by MIBG; MIBG scan can be stable disease (SD) or CR in soft tissue lesions corresponding to lesions on CT/MRI. CR in bone marrow. No new sites of tumor; PR= \>=30% decrease in the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions. Bone marrow with CR. MIBG with either PR/CR in bone lesions; MIBG may be SD or CR in soft tissue lesions corresponding to lesions on CT/MRI. Homovanillic acid (HVA)/Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) may still be elevated., Up to the first 6 cycles of treatment|Percentage of Patients in the Dinutuximab Arm Who Are Responders, Percentage of patients who are responders to therapy with dinutuximab will be tabulated, including a 95% confidence interval on the response rate.
