NCT00747877,High-Dose Melphalan and a Second Stem Cell Transplant or Low-Dose Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma After Chemotherapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00747877,,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and bortezomib before a peripheral stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, and certain chemotherapy drugs, helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. Chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and bortezomib. It is not yet known whether high-dose melphalan given together with a second stem cell transplant is more effective than low-dose cyclophosphamide in treating patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving high-dose melphalan together with a second stem cell transplant to see how well it works compared with low-dose cyclophosphamide in treating patients with relapsed multiple myeloma after chemotherapy.",NO,Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm,DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: melphalan|PROCEDURE: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,Time to disease progression,"Response rate to bortezomib, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and dexamethasone (PAD)|Overall response rate following randomized treatments|Overall survival|Progression-free survival|Toxicity and safety of autologous stem cell transplantation|Toxicity and safety of weekly cyclophosphamide|Toxicity and safety of PAD therapy|Feasibility of stem cell collection|Pain|Quality of life",,Leeds Cancer Centre at St. James's University Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,460,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,LCC-HM05/7287|CDR0000612567|EU-20873|ISRCTN60123120|EudraCT-2006-005890-24,2008-04,2012-04,,2008-09-05,,2013-08-12,"Basingstoke and North Hampshire NHS Foundation Trust, Basingstoke, England, RG24 9NA, United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth Hospital at University Hospital of Birmingham NHS Trust, Birmingham, England, B15 2TH, United Kingdom|Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, England, B9 5SS, United Kingdom|Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, England, BH7 7DW, United Kingdom|Bradford Royal Infirmary, Bradford, England, BD9 6RJ, United Kingdom|Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, England, BS16 1LE, United Kingdom|Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, Bristol, England, BS2 8ED, United Kingdom|Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England, CB2 2QQ, United Kingdom|St. Helier Hospital, Carshalton, England, SM5 1AA, United Kingdom|Gloucestershire Oncology Centre at Cheltenham General Hospital, Cheltenham, England, GL53 7AN, United Kingdom|Saint Richards Hospital, Chichester, England, P019 4SE, United Kingdom|Colchester General Hospital, Colchester, England, CO4 5JL, United Kingdom|Dorset County Hospital, Dorchester, England, DT1 2JY, United Kingdom|Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley, England, DY1 2HQ, United Kingdom|Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, Exeter, England, EX2 5DW, United Kingdom|Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, Gloucester, England, GL1 3NN, United Kingdom|Ipswich Hospital, Ipswich, England, IP4 5PD, United Kingdom|Leeds Cancer Centre at St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, England, LS9 7TF, United Kingdom|Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, England, L7 8XP, United Kingdom|Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool, England, L9 7AL, United Kingdom|Saint Bartholomew's Hospital, London, England, EC1A 7BE, United Kingdom|Guy's Hospital, London, England, SE1 9RT, United Kingdom|King's College Hospital, London, England, SE5 9RS, United Kingdom|St. George's Hospital, London, England, SW17 0QT, United Kingdom|University College of London Hospitals, London, England, WIT 3AA, United Kingdom|Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, England, M13 9WL, United Kingdom|Christie Hospital, Manchester, England, M20 4BX, United Kingdom|James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, England, TS4 3BW, United Kingdom|Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, NE1 4LP, United Kingdom|Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, England, NR4 7UY, United Kingdom|Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, England, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom|Oxford Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, England, 0X3 9DU, United Kingdom|Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, England, PL6 8DH, United Kingdom|Berkshire Cancer Centre at Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, England, RG1 5AN, United Kingdom|Rotherham General Hospital, Rotherham, England, S60 2UD, United Kingdom|Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, England, SP2 8BJ, United Kingdom|Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, England, S1O 2JF, United Kingdom|Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, England, SO16 6YD, United Kingdom|Royal Marsden -
