The instrument and the fatigue and non-fatigue subscales are scored by summing points from all questions, then converting this sum to a 100 point scale; 0 = the poorest QOL and 100 = the highest QOL., Cycle 6 Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Change From Baseline in Responses to the Fact-Anemia Item GP-5 - Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1), The distribution (frequency and percentage) of the observed responses (i.e., ""Not at all (0),"" ""A little bit (1),"" ""Somewhat (2),"" ""Quite a bit (3),"" ""Very much (4),"" and missing) to Item GP-5 (""I am bothered by side effects of treatment"" in the past seven days) of the FACT-An at each scheduled visit were summarized for each treatment group.
