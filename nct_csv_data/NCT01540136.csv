NCT01540136,Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With Nedaplatin Versus Cisplatin in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01540136,,COMPLETED,This is a Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of nedaplatin versus cisplatin with IMRT chemoradiotherapy in treating patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,NO,Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,DRUG: Nedaplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin,"Progress-free survival, Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first progress at any site., 2 years","Determine the toxic effects, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and quality of life (QoL) of these regimens in these patients., Administration and Monitoring Patients will be evaluated in the clinic and eligibility and informed consent obtained. Patients will be monitored for clinical toxicity by standard NIH criteria. QoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTCQLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ Head and Neck. A time period of 4 weeks will constitute the time for clinical safety monitoring., 4 weeks|Complete Response (CR), CR assessed by independent reviewers, according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Disease response evaluated after the completion of the chemoradiotherapy treatment. Complete response defined as the complete disappearance of the target and non-target lesion(s) identified at baseline after radiological evaluation by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) only., after the completion of the chemoradiotherapy treatment (up to 9 weeks)|Overall Survival(OS), The OS was defined as the duration from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 2 years|Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival(LRRFS), The LRRFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 2 years|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), The DMFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 2 years|Anti-neoplasms sensitization effects of chemotherapy to radiotherapy, Tumor response will be evaluated by physical examination and nasopharyngoscopy when radiotherapy in 20Gy、40Gy、70Gy., radiotherapy in 20Gy、40Gy、70Gy|Cost-effectiveness analysis, The determination of cost, including direct cost drug fees, inspection fees, expenses and nursing cost; cost-effectiveness analysis, such as cost-effectiveness ratio (ratio of the direct cost and short - and long-term curative effect) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (i.e., increasing costs and increase short or long-term efficacy ratio)., completion of chemoradiotherapy|Correlate effects of CCRT with biomarkers of response and predictors of long-term outcome, Early identification of patients who will have more aggressive disease soon after diagnosis has been a major goal, we will investigate the correlate effects of CCRT with biomarkers of response and predictors of long-term outcome in these patients., before chemoradiotherapy and after chemoradiotherapy",,Sun Yat-sen University,Guangzhou Medical University|The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University|Meizhou City Hospital Of Guangdong Provience,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,402,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Sun Yat-sen University,2012-02,2014-05,2016-07,2012-02-28,,2016-10-28,"Department of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China",
