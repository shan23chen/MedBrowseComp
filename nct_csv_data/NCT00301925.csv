NCT00301925,Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer That Has Been Removed By Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00301925,TACT2,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating early stage breast cancer that has been removed by surgery.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying four different combination chemotherapy regimens to compare how well they work in treating patients with early stage breast cancer that has been removed by surgery.",NO,Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: pegfilgrastim|DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: epirubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: methotrexate|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy,Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years,"Overall survival at 5 years|Distant DFS at 5 years|Tolerability (including serious adverse events, dose-intensity, and toxicity)|Detailed toxicity|Quality of life",,"Institute of Cancer Research, United Kingdom",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,4400,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: FACTORIAL|Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000463447|ICR-TACT2|EU-205114|EUDRACT-2004-000066-13|MREC-04/MRE00/88|ISRCTN68068041,2005-12-16,2024-09,2024-09,2006-03-13,,2018-08-08,"William Harvey Hospital, Ashford-Kent, England, TN24 0LZ, United Kingdom|Wansbeck General Hospital, Ashington, England, NE63 9JJ, United Kingdom|Tameside General Hospital, Ashton-Under-Lyne, England, OL6 9RW, United Kingdom|North Devon District Hospital, Barnstaple, England, EX31 4JB, United Kingdom|Furness General Hospital, Barrow in Furness, England, LA14 4LF, United Kingdom|Basildon University Hospital, Basildon, England, SS16 5NL, United Kingdom|Basingstoke and North Hampshire NHS Foundation Trust, Basingstoke, England, RG24 9NA, United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth Hospital at University Hospital of Birmingham NHS Trust, Birmingham, England, B15 2TH, United Kingdom|City Hospital -
