NCT00098475,Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone With or Without Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00098475,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone to see how well it works compared to lenalidomide and standard-dose dexamethasone, given with or without thalidomide, in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Lenalidomide and thalidomide may also stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone together may kill more cancer cells.",YES,DS Stage I Multiple Myeloma|DS Stage II Multiple Myeloma|DS Stage III Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Dexamethasone|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Thalidomide,"Proportion of Patients With Objective Response (First Phase, Step 1), Objective response is defined as either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Patients who have complete disappearance of an M-protein and no evidence of myeloma in the bone marrow are considered to have CR. PR requires all the following: (1) ≥50% reduction in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein. (2) Reduction in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion either by ≥90% or to \<200 mg. (3)For patients with non-secretory (or oligosecretory) myeloma only, a ≥50% reduction in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and on trephine biopsy must be documented. (4)50% reduction in size of soft tissue plasmacytoma (by radiography or clinical examination). (5) No increase in the number or size of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).

As the expansion phase was a substudy terminated early with only 7 patients enrolled, the clinical results presented are mainly for the first phase only., Assessed every 4 weeks for 16 weeks during Step 1","Proportion of Patients With Objective Response (First Phase, Step 2), Objective response is defined as either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).
