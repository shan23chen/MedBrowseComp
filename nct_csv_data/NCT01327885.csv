NCT01327885,Phase 3 Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Eribulin With Dacarbazine in Subjects With Soft Tissue Sarcoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01327885,,COMPLETED,"This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of eribulin with dacarbazine in subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have disease progression within 6 months prior to study enrolment following standard therapies which must have included an anthracycline, unless contraindicated and then at least one additional regimen after failure of the anthracycline.",YES,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,"DRUG: Eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m^2 intravenous|DRUG: Dacarbazine of 850 mg/m^2, or 1,000 mg/m^2, or 1,200 mg/m^2 IV","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time in months from the date of treatment start until death, regardless of cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, participants were censored either at the date that participant was last known to be alive or the date of study cut-off, whichever was earlier. Participants who died on the date of randomization had a survival time of 0.5 day. Allocation of randomization numbers were performed based upon the following stratification factors: (a) Histology (adipocytic \[ADI\] or leiomyosarcoma \[LMS\]), (b) Region (Region 1: USA and Canada; or Region 2: Western Europe, Australia, Israel; or Region 3: Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia), and (c) Number of prior regimens for advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) (2 or greater than \[\>\] 2 prior regimens)., From date of treatment start until date of death from any cause, up to 5 years 5 months","Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurred first). The date of disease progression was defined as the date of radiologic disease progression as assessed by the investigator or designee based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Participants who did not have an event (i.e., participants who were lost to follow-up or who did not progress or die at the date of data cut-off), were censored. Participants who discontinued study treatment without disease progression were censored on the date of their last radiological assessment (scan date)., Randomization (day 1) to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurred first), up to 5 years 5 months|Progression-Free Rate at 12 Weeks (PFR12wks), The PFR12wks was defined as the percentage of participants who were still alive without disease progression at 12 weeks from the date of randomization. Tumor assessment by the investigator or designee was based on RECIST criteria 1.1., From date of randomization start until Week 12|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR was defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR), or partial response (PR), or duration of stable disease (dSD) greater than or equal to 11 weeks, between Arm A and Arm B. CBR was estimated by treatment arm based on the tumor response evaluation performed by the PI or designee according to RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter., From date of treatment start (Day 1) until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, participant's choice to stop study treatment, up to 5 years 5 months",,Eisai Inc.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,452,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,E7389-G000-309|2010-024483-17,2011-03-10,2015-01-02,2016-08-10,2011-04-04,2017-02-28,2023-06-22,"Tucson, Arizona, United States|Los Angeles, California, United States|Orange, California, United States|Santa Monica, California, United States|Stanford, California, United States|Aurora, Colorado, United States|Denver, Colorado, United States|Newark, Delaware, United States|Washington, District of Columbia, United States|Tampa, Florida, United States|Atlanta, Georgia, United States|Post Falls, Idaho, United States|Chicago, Illinois, United States|Park Ridge, Illinois, United States|Urbana, Illinois, United States|Iowa City, Iowa, United States|Boston, Massachusetts, United States|Saint Louis, Missouri, United States|Newark, New Jersey, United States|Buffalo, New York, United States|New York, New York, United States|Rochester, New York, United States|Durham, North Carolina, United States|Cleveland, Ohio, United States|Portland, Oregon, United States|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States|Houston, Texas, United States|Burlington, Vermont, United States|Seattle, Washington, United States|Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina|San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina|San Salvador de Jujuy, Argentina|Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia|St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia|Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia|Woodville South, South Australia, Australia|Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia|Graz, Austria|Salzburg, Austria|Wien, Austria|Bruxelles, Belgium|Leuven, Belgium|Liege, Belgium|Porto Alegre, Rio Grande Do Sul, Brazil|Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil|Barretos, Brazil|Curitiba, Brazil|Jau, Brazil|Porto Alegre, Brazil|Salvador, Brazil|Sao Paulo, Brazil|Ottawa, Ontario, Canada|Toronto, Ontario, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, Canada|Brno, Czechia|Hradec kralove, Czechia|Novy Jicin, Czechia|Praha 5, Czechia|Herlev, Denmark|Angers, France|Bordeaux, France|Lyon, France|Marseille, France|Nantes, France|Paris, France|Poitiers, France|Saint-Priest en Jarez, France|Villejuif, France|Berlin, Germany|Dresden, Germany|Essen, Germany|Hannover, Germany|Koln, Germany|Mannheim, Germany|Tubingen, Germany|Haifa, Israel|Jerusalem, Israel|Ramat-Gan, Israel|Tel Aviv, Israel|Aviano, Pordenone, Italy|Candiolo, Italy|Milano, Italy|Monza, Italy|Padova, Italy|Rozzano (MI), Italy|Torino, Italy|Daejeon, Korea, Republic of|Seongnam, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, Korea, Republic of|Amsterdam, Netherlands|Leiden, Netherlands|Christchurch, New Zealand|Gdansk, Poland|Gliwice, Poland|Warszawa, Poland|Cluj-Napoca, Romania|Craiova, Romania|Iasi, Romania|Sibiu, Romania|Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation|Kazan, Russian Federation|Moscow, Russian Federation|Obninsk, Russian Federation|Singapore, Singapore|Palma de Mallorca, Baleares, Spain|Badalona, Cataluna, Spain|L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Cataluna, Spain|Madrid, Comunidad De Madrid, Spain|Barcelona, Spain|Valencia, Spain|Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand|Bangkok, Thailand|Chiang Mai, Thailand|Pathum Wan, Thailand|Glasgow, United Kingdom|London, United Kingdom|Manchester, United Kingdom|Swansea, United Kingdom",
