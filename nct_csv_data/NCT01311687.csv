The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 3 levels of response: No problem (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions into a single utility index score. EQ-5D index values range from -0.59 to 1.00 where an EQ-5D score of 1.00 equals ""perfect health"", a score of 0 equals ""death"" and a score of -0.59 equals worst imaginable health state. A positive change from Baseline score indicates improvement in health status. A negative change from Baseline score indicates worsening in health status. Negative scores represent the possible though unlikely situation that a patient's QOL is worse than death, i.e. they would rather be dead than living with that QOL, Day 1 of Cycle 1 (Baseline), and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6|Time to First Worsening of Quality of Life (QOL) Domains, Time to worsening in quality of life domains was calculated as the time from Baseline to the first worsened minimally important difference (MID), defined as the smallest change in a QOL score considered important to patients that would lead the patient or clinician to consider a change in therapy. MID thresholds were calculated in Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) units using the Baseline QOL data. Based on the MID, participants were classified as worsened according to the following: For the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status and functional scales and the EQ-5D health utility score, participants were classified as worsened if their change from Baseline score was less than -1 SEM. For the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scores (fatigue and pain) and EORTC QLQ-MY20 disease symptoms and side effects scales, participants were classified as worsened if their change from Baseline score was greater than 1 SEM.
