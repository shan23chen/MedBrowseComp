NCT01532856,Iberoamerican Protocol With Thalidomide in Patients With Symptomatic Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Over 65 Years,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01532856,,UNKNOWN,"This protocol is an international, multicenter, comparative, open and randomized study designed to compare the safety and efficacy (in terms of response rate) from three induction chemotherapy schemes -Thalidomide/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone versus Thalidomide/Dexamethasone versus Thalidomide/Melphalan/Prednisone. Finally, this study is also designed to compare the safety and efficacy (in terms of duration of response) of two maintenance chemotherapy regimens - Thalidomide/Prednisone versus Thalidomide. Each treatment arm will include 100 patients and assessments and scheduled visits will be conducted in three periods: Pre-treatment, treatment and monitoring. Security will be evaluated by monitoring all adverse events, physical examination, vital signs and biochemical studies. Response to treatment will be evaluated according to the EBMT21 criteria and will be assessed on day 1 of each cycle of induction, at the end of nine cycles of induction therapy and monthly during the first year of maintenance therapy and every 3 months thereafter.",NO,Multiple Myeloma,"DRUG: Thalidomide, Cyclophosphamide, Dexamethasone|DRUG: Thalidomide, Dexamethasone|DRUG: Thalidomide, Melphalan, Prednisone","Response rate, Response rate is evaluated between the 3 treatment arms, 36 months|Duration of response, Duration of response was defined as the time to the first evidence of laboratorisl progreesion., 36 months","overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from randomization to death or the last follow-up for surviving patients., 36 months|event-free survival, Event-free survival was defined as the interval from randomization to any event (death or descontinuation due to protocol violation or non-acceptable toxicities), 36 months|progression free-survival, Progression free-survival was defined as the time between randomization and any documentation of relapse, progression, or death by any cause., 36 months",,Grupo de Estudos Multicentricos em Onco-Hematologia,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,64,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,GBRAM0002,2007-01,2011-12,2012-06,2012-02-15,,2012-02-15,"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil|Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil",
