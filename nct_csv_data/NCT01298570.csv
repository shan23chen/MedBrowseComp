NCT01298570,Regorafenib+FOLFIRI Versus Placebo+FOLFIRI as 2nd Line Tx in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01298570,,COMPLETED,"This randomized (2:1), multi-center, placebo-controlled, phase II efficacy study is designed to compare PFS between regorafenib + FOLFIRI chemotherapy (ARM A) versus placebo + FOLFIRI (ARM B) in patients with mCRC previously treated with a FOLFOX regimen.",YES,Colorectal Cancer Metastatic,DRUG: Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506)|DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: FOLFIRI,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), To compare PFS between regorafenib + FOLFIRI chemotherapy (ARM A) versus placebo + FOLFIRI (ARM B) in patients failing one prior oxaliplatin-containing regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer. PFS is defined as the time from randomization until metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) progression or death as a result of any cause. Radiographic response will be measured by RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria, indicating if subject experienced a Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), no response or less response than Partial or Progressive; or Progressive Disease (PD), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 5.5 years","Overall Response(OR)Rate, To compare overall response (OR) rates (OR= CR + PR) between ARM A and ARM B as defined via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 3 years|Disease Control (DC) Rate, To compare Disease Control (DC) Rate (DC= CR + PR + SD) between ARM A and ARM B as defined via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and Stable Disease (SD) ), no response or less response than Partial or Progressive; or Progressive Disease (PD), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), To compare overall survival (OS) between ARM A and ARM B. OS is defined as the time from randomization until death as a result of any cause., 5.5 years|Drug Metabolism, To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of FOLFIRI between a subset of patients receiving regorafenib (ARM A) and patients receiving placebo (Arm B). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) levels of the irinotecan metabolite SN-38 were compared., 28 days|Percentage of Patients With Severe Adverse Events, Toxicity Assessments were made according to NCI CTCAE v. 4.0 .
