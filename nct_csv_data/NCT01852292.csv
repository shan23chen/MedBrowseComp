NCT01852292,Study of Efficacy and Safety of Buparlisib (BKM120) Plus Paclitaxel Versus Placebo Plus Paclitaxel in Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Previously Pre-treated With a Platinum Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01852292,,TERMINATED,Phase II Study of efficacy and safety of buparlisib (BKM120) plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in recurrent or metastatic Head and Neck cancer previously pre-treated with a platinum therapy.The primary endpoint was PFS and the key secondary endpoint was Overall Survival.,YES,Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,DRUG: Buparlisib|DRUG: Buparlisib matching Placebo|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Investigator Assessment, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the event, defined as the first radiologically documented disease progression per RECIST v. 1.1 or death due to any cause. If a patient has not progressed or died at the analysis cut-off date or when the patient receives further anti-neoplastic therapy, PFS was censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earlier of the cut-off date or start of the further anti-neoplastic therapy date., 4 weeks and thereafter every 6 weeks until disease progression or death up to 3.5 years","Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died by the date of analysis cut-off, OS was censored at the date of last contact., 4 weeks and thereafter every 6 weeks until disease progression or death up to 3.5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Per Local Radiological Assessment, ORR: percentage of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have a short axis of \<10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters or the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions or lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at Baseline with a short axis of ≥10mm)., 4 weeks and thereafter every 6 weeks until disease progression or death up to 3.5 years|Time to Response (TTR) as Per Local Radiological Assessment, TTR is the time from date of randomization until first documented response (CR or PR, which has to be confirmed subsequently) according to RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have a short axis of \<10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters or the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions or lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at Baseline with a short axis of ≥10mm)., 4 weeks and thereafter every 6 weeks until disease progression or death up to 3.5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Per Local Radiological Assessment, DCR is the percentage of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD), according to RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions \& any pathological lymph nodes must have a short axis of \<10 mm \& the disappearance of all non-target lesions). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters or the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions or lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at Baseline with a short axis of ≥10mm). SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm\^2., 4 weeks and thereafter every 6 weeks until disease progression or death up to 3.5 years|Duration of Response (DoR) as Per Local Investigator, DoR is the time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR, which had to be confirmed subsequently) to the date of the first radiologically documented disease progression or death due to disease according to RECIST v1.1 ., 4 weeks and thereafter every 6 weeks until disease progression or death up to 3.5 years|Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL):Time to 10% Definitive Deterioration in the Global Health Status/Quality of Life Per EORTC-QLQ-C30, A summary of EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores by time window. Time to deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and the date of the assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen. Definitive Deterioration in global health status and symptoms was defined as a decrease in the subscale score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study. If a patient had not had an event prior to analysis cut-off or start of another anticancer therapy, time to deterioration was censored at the date of the last quality of life (QoL) evaluation., Baseline, every 6 weeks starting from cycle 2 day 15 up to 3.5 years|Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL):Time to 10% Definitive Deterioration in the Head and Neck Cancer Symptoms Scales for Pain, Speech Problems, Swallowing and Sense Problems Per EORTC-QLQ-HN35, A summary of EORTC-QLQ-HN35 scores by time window. Time to deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and the date of the assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen. Definitive Deterioration in global health status and symptoms was defined as an increase in the subscale score of at least 10% compared to baseline, with no later decrease above this threshold observed during the course of the study. If a patient had not had an event prior to analysis cut-off or start of another anticancer therapy, time to deterioration was censored at the date of the last quality of life (QoL) evaluation., Baseline, every 6 weeks starting from cycle 2 day 15 up to 3.5 years|Plasma Concentration-time Profiles of BKM120 Pharmacokinetics (PK) for AUC0-24 and AUClast, To Characterize PK of buparlisib given in combination with paclitaxel for AUC0-24 (area under plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to end of dosing interval of 24 hours) \& AUClast (AUC from time 0 to last measurable concentration sampling time)., Time point(s) at which PK samples for Non-Compartmental analysis were collected were 0, 0.5,1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 24 hours at Cycle 1, Day 15|Plasma Concentration-time Profiles of BKM120 Pharmacokinetics (PK) for Cmax, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of buparlisib given in combination with paclitaxel for Cmax., Time point(s) at which PK samples for Non-Compartmental analysis were collected were 0, 0.5,1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 24 hours at Cycle 1, Day 15|Plasma Concentration-time Profiles of BKM120 Pharmacokinetics (PK) for Tmax, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of buparlisib given in combination with paclitaxel for Tmax., Time point(s) at which PK samples for Non-Compartmental analysis were collected were 0, 0.5,1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 24 hours at Cycle 1, Day 15|Plasma Concentration-time Profiles of BKM120 Pharmacokinetics (PK) for CL/F, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of buparlisib given in combination with paclitaxel for CL/F., Time point(s) at which PK samples for Non-Compartmental analysis were collected were 0, 0.5,1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 24 hours at Cycle 1, Day 15",,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,157,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CBKM120H2201|2013-000744-26,2013-10-01,2017-03-30,2017-03-30,2013-05-13,2018-06-26,2018-07-24,"Highlands Oncology Group, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute IRB, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Washington U School of Medicine Center for Clinical Studies SC - BKM120H2201, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|The Mount Sinai Hospital Dept of Oncology, New York, New York, 10029, United States|University of N.C. at Chapel Hill Lineberger Comp.
