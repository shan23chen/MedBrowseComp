NCT01715285,"A Study of Abiraterone Acetate Plus Low-Dose Prednisone Plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Versus ADT Alone in Newly Diagnosed Participants With High-Risk, Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer (mHNPC)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01715285,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to determine if newly diagnosed (within previous 3 months) participants with metastatic (spread of cancer cells from one part of the body to another ) hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC) who have high-risk prognostic factors will benefit from the addition of abiraterone acetate plus low-dose prednisone to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; lutenizing hormone releasing hormone \[LHRH\] agonists or surgical castration).,YES,Prostate Neoplasms,DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Prednisone|OTHER: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate Placebo|DRUG: Prednisone Placebo,"Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Radiographic PFS was defined as the time (in months) interval from randomization to the first date of radiographic progression or death. Radiographic progression included progression by bone scan (according to modified Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 \[PCWG2\] criteria), defined as at least 2 new lesions on bone scan and progression of soft tissue lesions by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1 criteria). As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and a minimum absolute increase of 5 millimeter (mm) in the sum as compared to nadir sum of diameter., Up to 44 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause., Up to 66 months","Time to Initiation of Chemotherapy, Time to initiation of chemotherapy was defined as the time (in months) interval from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer., Up to 66 months|Time to Subsequent Therapy for Prostate Cancer, Time to subsequent therapy was defined as the time (in months) interval from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of subsequent therapy for prostate cancer., Up to 66 months|Time to Pain Progression, Time to pain progression was defined as the time (in months) interval from randomization to the first date a participant experienced a greater than or equal to (\>=) 30 percent (%) increase in Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) from baseline in the BPI-SF worst pain intensity (Item 3) observed at 2 consecutive evaluations (\>=4) weeks apart. BPI-SF was an 11-item questionnaire, designed to assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Total score ranged from 0 to 10 with 0 representing ""no pain"" and 10 representing"" pain as bad as you can imagine., Up to 66 months|Time to Skeletal-Related Event, Time to skeletal-related event was defined as the earliest of the following: clinical or pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, palliative radiation to bone, or surgery to bone., Up to 66 months|Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression was defined as the time (in months) interval from the date of randomization to the date of PSA progression, according to PCWG2 criteria. PCWG2 defines PSA progression as the date that a 25 percent (%) or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) or more from the nadir is documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later., Up to 66 months",,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC",,MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1209,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CR100900|212082PCR3011|2012-002940-26|U1111-1135-7146,2013-02-12,2016-10-31,2022-02-13,2012-10-26,2018-10-15,2025-03-25,"Buenos Aires, Argentina|Caba, Argentina|Cordoba, Argentina|La Rioja, Argentina|Rosario, Argentina|Adelaide, Australia|Footscray, Australia|Liverpool, Australia|Malvern, Australia|Randwick, Australia|Wahroonga, Australia|Antwerpen, Belgium|Bonheiden, Belgium|Brasschaat, Belgium|Bruxelles, Belgium|Charleroi, Belgium|Liège, Belgium|Namur, Belgium|Ottignies, Belgium|Sint-Niklaas, Belgium|Yvoir, Belgium|Barretos, Brazil|Belo Horizonte, Brazil|Caxias Do Sul, Brazil|Curitiba, Brazil|Ijui, Brazil|Jau, Brazil|Natal, Brazil|Novo Hamburgo, Brazil|Porto Alegre, Brazil|Ribeirao Preto, Brazil|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Salvador, Brazil|Sao Jose Do Rio Preto, Brazil|Sao Paulo, Brazil|Gabrovo, Bulgaria|Sofia, Bulgaria|Edmonton, Alberta, Canada|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada|Hamilton, Ontario, Canada|Kingston, Ontario, Canada|Oshawa, Ontario, Canada|Ottawa, Ontario, Canada|Toronto, Ontario, Canada|Montreal, Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada|Santiago, Chile|Beijing, China|Chengdu, China|Chongqing, China|Guangzhou, China|Hangzhou, China|Nanjing, China|Shanghai, China|Su Zhou, China|Tianjin, China|Wuhan, China|Bogota, Colombia|Floridablanca, Colombia|Medellin, Colombia|Hradec Kralove, Czechia|Olomouc, Czechia|Plzen, Czechia|Praha 10, Czechia|Praha 2, Czechia|Praha 4, Czechia|Aarhus N., Denmark|Holsterbro, Denmark|Odense N/a, Denmark|Roskilde, Denmark|Vejle, Denmark|Oulu, Finland|Tampere, Finland|La Chaussee St Victor, France|Lille, France|Montpellier, France|Paris Cedex 14, France|Suresnes, France|Toulouse, France|Villejuif Cedex, France|Düsseldorf, Germany|Hamburg, Germany|Nürtingen, Germany|Budapest N/a, Hungary|Budapest, Hungary|Győr, Hungary|Miskolc, Hungary|Pecs, Hungary|Szentes, Hungary|Beer Yaakov, Israel|Beer-Sheva, Israel|Haifa, Israel|Jerusalem, Israel|Kfar Saba, Israel|Petah-Tikva, Israel|Ramat Gan, Israel|Chiba, Japan|Gifu, Japan|Kashiwa, Japan|Matsuyama, Japan|Nankoku, Japan|Osaka-Sayama, Japan|Sakura, Japan|Tokushima, Japan|Tokyo, Japan|Ube, Japan|Yokohama, Japan|Yufu, Japan|Bucheon-Si, Korea, Republic of|Busan, Korea, Republic of|Daegu, Korea, Republic of|Daejeon, Korea, Republic of|Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, Korea, Republic of|Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|Kuching, Malaysia|Chihuahua, Mexico|Cuernavaca, Mexico|Durango, Mexico|Guadalajara, Mexico|Monterrey, Mexico|Oaxaca, Mexico|Pachuca de Soto, Mexico|Zapopan, Mexico|Alkmaar, Netherlands|Amsterdam Zuidoost, Netherlands|Amsterdam, Netherlands|Hilversum, Netherlands|Hoofddorp, Netherlands|Nieuwegein, Netherlands|Rotterdam, Netherlands|Auckland, New Zealand|Christchurch, New Zealand|Hamilton, New Zealand|Tauranga, New Zealand|Bydgoszcz, Poland|Gdansk, Poland|Lodz, Poland|Lublin, Poland|Warszawa, Poland|Braga, Portugal|Coimbra, Portugal|Lisboa, Portugal|Porto, Portugal|Brasov, Romania|Bucharest, Romania|Bucuresti, Romania|Cluj Napoca, Romania|Iasi, Romania|Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation|Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation|Ivanovo, Russian Federation|Izhevsk, Russian Federation|Moscow, Russian Federation|Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation|Obninsk, Russian Federation|Omsk, Russian Federation|Orenburg, Russian Federation|Pyatigorsk, Russian Federation|Rostov-on-Don, Russian Federation|Ryazan, Russian Federation|Sankt-Peterburg, Russian Federation|Saransk, Russian Federation|Saratov, Russian Federation|Sochi, Russian Federation|St.-Petersburg, Russian Federation|Stavropol, Russian Federation|Tumen, Russian Federation|Ufa, Russian Federation|Volgograd, Russian Federation|Yoshkar-Ola, Russian Federation|Košice-Šaca, Slovakia|Martin, Slovakia|Piestany, Slovakia|Prešov, Slovakia|Rimavska Sobota, Slovakia|Trnava, Slovakia|George, South Africa|Port Elizabeth, South Africa|Pretoria, South Africa|Vosloorus, South Africa|Barcelona, Spain|Cordoba, Spain|Coruña, Spain|Madrid N/a, Spain|Madrid, Spain|Murcia N/a, Spain|Göteborg, Sweden|Malmö, Sweden|Stockholm, Sweden|Umeå, Sweden|Uppsala, Sweden|Adana, Turkey|Ankara, Turkey|Istanbul, Turkey|Izmir, Turkey|Zonguldak, Turkey|Cherkassy, Ukraine|Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine|Dnipro, Ukraine|Khakhiv, Ukraine|Kharkiv, Ukraine|Kyiv, Ukraine|Lviv, Ukraine|Makiivka, Ukraine|Odessa, Ukraine|Uzhgorod, Ukraine|Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine|Cambridge, United Kingdom|Glasgow, United Kingdom|Manchester, United Kingdom|Nottingham, United Kingdom|Oxford, United Kingdom|Plymouth, United Kingdom",
