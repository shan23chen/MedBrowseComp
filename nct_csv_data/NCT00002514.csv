NCT00002514,Stem Cell Transplantation Compared With Standard Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in First Remission,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00002514,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether stem cell transplantation is more effective than standard chemotherapy in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well stem cell transplantation works compared to standard combination chemotherapy in treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission.",NO,Leukemia,BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim|DRUG: asparaginase|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: daunorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: imatinib mesylate|DRUG: leucovorin calcium|DRUG: mercaptopurine|DRUG: methotrexate|DRUG: prednisone|DRUG: thioguanine|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|PROCEDURE: allogeneic bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: autologous bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Overall Survival, All patients were followed for 2 years",,,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|Medical Research Council,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1929,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000078099|E2993|MRC-LEUK-UKALL-XII|EST-4491,1993-05-07,2006-12,,2003-01-27,,2023-06-18,"Aurora Presbyterian Hospital, Aurora, Colorado, 80012, United States|Boulder Community Hospital, Boulder, Colorado, 80301-9019, United States|Penrose Cancer Center at Penrose Hospital, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80933, United States|Porter Adventist Hospital, Denver, Colorado, 80210, United States|Presbyterian -
