There are 4 multi-item scales - fatigue (2 items), treatment side effects (\[TSE\], 4 items), disease symptoms (disease effects scale \[DES\], 4 items), and infection scale \[IS\] (4 items) - and single item scales (social activities \[Social Problems (SP) Scale\] and future health worries\[Future Health (FH) Scale\].). These are measured on a four point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much. These scores are transformed to give a rating from 0 - 100, where 0 =no symptoms or problems and 100 = a severe symptoms or problems. EORTC QLQ-CLL16 was assessed at Screening; Cycle 4 Day 1 and during follow-up 1 M and every 3 M up to 24 months. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value was obtained at randomization., Screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, and 1 M and every 3 month post last dose up to 24 month.|Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) as Assessed by EuroQoL Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) Score at Indicated Visit, EQ-5D is comprised of a 5-item health status measure and a visual analogue scale (VAS) and is used to generate two scores: the utility score and the thermometer score. The utility score measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses to each of the 5 health states are measured on a 3-point scale (level 1 = no problem; level 2 = some or moderate problem(s) and level 3 = unable, or extreme problems). Responses are typically converted into health utilities or valuations on a scale ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). The thermometer score ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. A Negative health status describes health state worse than death.Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study drug dose date., Screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, and 1 M and every 3 month post last dose up to 24 month.|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score, EORTC QLQ-C30, a self-reported, cancer-specific instrument assessing 15 domains: physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning, pain,fatigue, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, and dyspnea, financial difficulties and a global health status/quality of life (QOF).

Pat. assessed at Screening; Cycle 4 Day 1 and during follow-up 1 M and every 3 M up to 24 months. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Clinically meaningful changes or minimally important differences (MIDs)have been previously established for the EORTC QLQ C30, and categorized as 'small' if the mean change in scores is 5-10 points, 'moderate' if 10-20 points, and 'large' if \>20points., Screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, and 1 M and every 3 month post last dose up to 24 month.|Mean of Health Change Questionnaire (HCQ), The HCQ consists of a single question in which the participant is asked if he/she has experienced any change in his/her health overall since beginning the study. For HCQ, values from 1 to 9 were assigned to the 9 responses in the HCQ questionnaire, ranging from 1 for 'my health is a great deal better' to 9 for 'my health is a great deal worse' since the beginning of the study. Lower scores represent better conditions., Screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, and 1 M and every 3 month post last dose up to 24 month.|Mean Area Under the Time-concentration Curve (AUC) Curve Over the Dosing Interval (AUC[0-tau]) of Ofatumumab, Area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) over the dosing interval (AUC\[0-tau\]) was evaluated.
