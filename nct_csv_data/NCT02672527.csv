Considering the latest results with and without Trabectedin, the investigators may consider that comparing Trabectedin with best supportive care is ethically acceptable as long as patients consent to enter the trial.",NO,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,DRUG: Trabectedin|DRUG: Dexamethasone,"Progression Free Survival, Assessed every three weeks after randomization then every six weeks until progression or death of any cause whichever came first up to 30 months",,,"Gustave Roussy, Cancer Campus, Grand Paris",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,103,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2014-003176-23|2014/2154,2015-01-22,2018-07-14,2018-07-14,2016-02-03,,2018-08-16,"Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Villejuif, Val De Marne, 94805, France",
