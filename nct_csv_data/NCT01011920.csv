NCT01011920,Trial for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01011920,,COMPLETED,"This is a multicenter open label randomized phase II trial.

Enrolled Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) patients will be stratified according to the IELSG score and randomized to receive one of the follows as primary chemotherapy:

* Arm A: Methotrexate (MTX) + Cytarabine (Ara-C)
* Arm B: MTX + Ara-C + rituximab
* Arm C: MTX + Ara-C + rituximab + thiotepa.

Chemotherapy will be administered every three weeks. The maximum number of chemotherapy induction courses will be 4. Patients in Stable Disease (SD) or better after two courses will receive two more courses of the same primary chemotherapy regimen. Stem-cells harvest will be performed in the three arms after the second course. After 4 courses response assessment will be performed.

Patients who will not achieve SD or better after the 4th course, as well as those who will experience Progressive Disease (PD) at any time and those who will not achieve a sufficient stem cell harvest, will receive Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) 36-40 Gy +/- tumor bed boost of 9 Gy.

Patients who will achieve SD or better after the 4th course will be stratified according to objective response to primary chemotherapy and to primary chemotherapy regimen and randomly allocated to receive as consolidation therapy one of the follows:

* Arm D: WBRT 36 Gy +/- boost 9 Gy
* Arm E: Carmustine (BCNU) + Thiotepa + Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (APBSCT) Patients in Complete Response (CR) after WBRT or APBSCT will remain in follow-up. Patients who will not achieve a CR after WBRT will be managed according to physician's preferences. Patients who will not achieve a CR after APBSCT will be referred to WBRT.",NO,Central Nervous System Lymphoma,DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Ara-C|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Thiotepa|RADIATION: radiotherapy|DRUG: BCNU|OTHER: APBSCT,"response rate after primary chemotherapy and 2 years failure free survival at second randomization, 3 months, 2 years","safety, as acute and long-term toxicity, Throughout all the active treatment period|overall survival, From entry onto trial until death for any cause",,International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,126,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IELSG32,2009-11,2015-03,2017-03,2009-11-11,,2017-08-23,"University Hospital, Aachen, Germany|Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany|""Klinik für Hämatologie Universitätsklinikum Essen"", Essen, Germany|Uniklinik Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany|Universitätskrankenhaus Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany|Friedrich Schiller Universitaet Jena, Jena, Germany|Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz, Mainz, Germany|Technische Universität in München, München, Germany|Universitätsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany|A.O.
