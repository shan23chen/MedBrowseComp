NCT01065038,Anagrelide vs. Hydroxyurea - Efficacy and Tolerability Study in Patients With Essential Thrombocythaemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01065038,ANAHYDRET,COMPLETED,"Study AOP 03-007 was designed as a pivotal study to test, if Anagrelide (Thromboreductin®)was not inferior to HU with respect to efficacy in patients with ET. This approach to demonstrate non-inferiority was based on the following decision points:

• ET is a rare disease and recruitment of large patient number (\> 1600) to prove superiority was not considered possible.

. It was decided to recruit only treatment naïve high risk patients to avoid pre-treatment bias, which further limited the number of patients eligible for the study.",NO,Essential Thrombocythaemia,DRUG: Anagrelide|DRUG: Hydroxyurea,,,,AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals AG,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: |Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: ",AOP03007,2002-09,,,2010-02-09,,2010-10-06,"Center Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Tirol, 6020, Austria|Center AKH, Vienna, 1090, Austria|Center Hanusch, Vienna, 1140, Austria|Center Brno, Brno, 62500, Czech Republic|Center Olomouc, Olomouc, 77520, Czech Republic|Center Praha, Prague, 12808, Czech Republic|Center Paris, Paris, CLICHY Cedex, 92118, France|Center Munich, Munich, Bavaria, 80331, Germany|Center Berlin, Berlin, 12200, Germany|Center Halle, Halle, 06111, Germany|Center Saarbrücken, Saarbrücken, 66113, Germany|Center Ulm, Ulm, 89081, Germany|Center Budapest, Budapest, 1097, Hungary|Center Modena, Modena, 41100, Italy|Center Pavia, Pavia, 27100, Italy|Center Vilnius, Vilnius, 2600, Lithuania|Center Gdansk, Gdansk, 80-211, Poland|Center Katowice, Katowice, 40-027, Poland|Center Krakow, Krakow, 31-501, Poland|Center Lodz, Lodz, 93-510, Poland|Center Lublin, Lublin, 20-079, Poland|Center Warszawa, Warszawa, 02-097, Poland|Center Singapore, Singapore, 169608, Singapore|Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia",
