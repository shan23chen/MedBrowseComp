NCT02001506,Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of 6 Cycles vs 8 Cycles in Node Positve Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02001506,Neo-shorter,COMPLETED,"Various regimens and schedule as neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens were investigated and sequential treatment of anthracyclines followed by taxanes, which has shown superior pathologic complete respone (pCR) rate (NSABP-B27 study) is widely used until now. Considering the proven efficacy and tolerable toxicity of 3 cycles of FEC followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel (FEC3-D3) compared to FEC 6 cycles in adjuvant chemotherapy (PACS 01 trial), use of FEC3-D3 regimen in neoadjuvant setting will be feasible with acceptable efficacy and further reduce the duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",NO,Breast Cancer,DRUG: FEC3-D3,"pathologic complete response (pCR) between two arms, within the first 30 days (plus or minus 3 days) after surgery","3 year-disease free survival between two arms, 1.
