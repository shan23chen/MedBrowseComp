NCT00660894,Tegafur-Uracil and Leucovorin or S-1 in Treating Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed by Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00660894,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tegafur-uracil, leucovorin, and S-1, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving tegafur-uracil together with leucovorin is more effective than giving S-1 in treating patients with stage III colon cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving tegafur-uracil together with leucovorin to see how well it works compared with giving S-1 in treating patients with stage III colon cancer that has been completely removed by surgery.",NO,Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: folinate calcium|DRUG: tegafur-uracil|DRUG: tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium,Disease-free survival,Overall survival|Adverse event|Pharmaco-economics|Identification of predictive markers,,"Translational Research Center for Medical Innovation, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1535,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000593164|TMDU-TRICC0706,2008-04,2012-06,2015-07,2008-04-17,,2016-08-03,"Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan",
