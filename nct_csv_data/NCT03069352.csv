All questions employ the following five response options: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always. The PROMIS Fatigue 7a score is calculated as a T-score, which is a standardized score with a mean of 50 (based on the average for the United States general population) and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. A decrease in score (negative change from Baseline) indicates improvement in fatigue; the minimum important difference used in this study was 3 points., Baseline and Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, and 9|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status / Quality of Life, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core (EORTC QLQ-C30) consists of a Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) scale, a Financial Difficulties scale, 5 functional scales (Cognitive, Social, Physical, Emotional, and Role Functioning), and 8 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Pain, Constipation, Diarrhea, Dyspnea, and Nausea and Vomiting).

The GHS/QoL scale includes 2 questions in which participants were asked to rate their overall health and overall quality of life during the past week on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The 2 scores were averaged and transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, where a high score represents a high QoL. A positive change from baseline indicates better quality of life., Baseline and Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, and 9|Event-free Survival (EFS), Event-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of progressive disease (PD), confirmed morphologic relapse from CR or CRi, treatment failure (failure to achieve CR, CRi or morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) after at least 6 cycles of study treatment), or death from any cause, assessed by the investigator according to the modified IWG criteria.
