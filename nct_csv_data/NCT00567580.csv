NCT00567580,Prostate Radiation Therapy or Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Pelvic Lymph Node Radiation Therapy With or Without Prostate Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With a Rising Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) After Surgery for Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00567580,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. It is not yet known which regimen of radiation therapy with or without androgen-deprivation therapy is more effective for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying prostate radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with short-term androgen deprivation therapy given together with pelvic lymph node radiation therapy with or without prostate radiation therapy in treating patients with a rising PSA after surgery for prostate cancer.",YES,Prostate Cancer,RADIATION: PBRT|RADIATION: PLNRT|DRUG: AA|DRUG: LHRH agonist,"Percentage of Participants Free From Progression (FFP) at 5 Years, Progression is defined as the first occurrence of the following events: biochemical failure by the Phoenix definition (prostate-specific antigen \[PSA\] ≥ 2 ng/ml over the nadir PSA), clinical failure (local, regional or distant), or death from any cause. The initiation of second salvage therapy before progression was a protocol violation and resulted in censoring. Progression time is defined as time from randomization to the date of progression, second salvage therapy (censored), or last known follow-up (censored). Freedom from progression rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The study was designed for the final analysis to occur after all participants had been on study for at least 5 years, but results were reported early. See Limitations and Caveats section., From randomization to five years.","Percentage of Participants With Secondary Biochemical Failure (Alternative Biochemical Failure), Secondary biochemical (failure) is defined as either of two occurrences: 1. For detectable post-baseline PSA values (≥ 0.1), the first occurrence of a PSA value that is both ≥ 0.4 and a second rise above nadir; 2.The start of second salvage therapy. Failure time is defined as time from randomization to the date of failure, death (competing risk), or last known follow-up (censored). Failure rates for data summary are estimated using the cumulative incidence method, with 5-year rates provided here. Pairwise comparisons of the distributions of failure times, reported in the statistical analysis section, use cause-specific hazard rates for which deaths are censored. The study was designed for the final analysis to occur after all participants had been on study for at least 5 years, but results were reported early. See Limitations and Caveats section., From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 10.5 years.|Percentage of Participants Free From Hormone-refractory Disease (Castrate-resistant Disease), Hormone-refractory disease (failure) is defined as three rises in PSA after the start of second salvage androgen deprivation therapy. Failure time is defined as time from randomization to the date of failure, death (competing risk), or last known follow-up (censored). Failure rates for data summary are estimated using the cumulative incidence method, with 5-year rates provided here. Pairwise comparisons of the distributions of failure times, reported in the statistical analysis section, use cause-specific hazard rates for which deaths are censored. The study was designed for the final analysis to occur after all participants had been on study for at least 5 years, but the data monitoring committee decided to release results after the third interim analysis., From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 10.5 years.|Percentage of Participants With Local Failure, Local failure is defined as first occurrence of local clinical progression. Failure time is defined as time from randomization to the date of failure, death (competing risk), or last known follow-up (censored). Failure rates for data summary are estimated using the cumulative incidence method, with 5-year rates provided here. Pairwise comparisons of the distributions of failure times, reported in the statistical analysis section, use cause-specific hazard rates for which deaths are censored. The study was designed for the final analysis to occur after all participants had been on study for at least 5 years, but the data monitoring committee decided to release results after the third interim analysis., From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 10.5 years.|Percentage of Participants With Distant Metastasis, Distant metastasis (failure) is defined as the occurrence of distant metastasis determined by imaging. Failure time is defined as time from randomization to the date of failure, death (competing risk), or last known follow-up (censored). Failure rates for data summary are estimated using the cumulative incidence method, with 5-year rates provided here. Pairwise comparisons of the distributions of failure times, reported in the statistical analysis section, use cause-specific hazard rates for which deaths are censored. The study was designed for the final analysis to occur after all participants had been on study for at least 5 years, but the data monitoring committee decided to release results after the third interim analysis., From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 10.5 years.|Percentage of Participants Who Died Due to Prostate Cancer (Cause-specific Mortality), Cause-specific mortality (failure) is defined as death due to prostate cancer or complications of protocol treatment (centrally reviewed), or death following disease progression (clinical or biochemical) in the absence of or after the initiation of any salvage therapy. \[Biochemical progression is indicated by any rise in PSA.\] Failure time is defined as time from randomization to the date of failure, death (competing risk), or last known follow-up (censored). Failure rates for data summary are estimated using the cumulative incidence method, with 5-year rates provided here. Pairwise comparisons of the distributions of failure times, reported in the statistical analysis section, use cause-specific hazard rates for which deaths are censored. The study was designed for the final analysis to occur after all participants had been on study for at least 5 years, but the data monitoring committee decided to release results after the third interim analysis., From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 10.5 years.|Percentage of Participants Alive (Overall Mortality), Survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Pairwise comparisons of the overall distributions of failure times are reported in statistical analysis section, with five-year rates reported here. The study was designed for the final analysis to occur after all participants had been on study for at least 5 years, but the data monitoring committee decided to release results after the third interim analysis., From randomization to last follow-up.
