NCT02819518,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Chemotherapy vs. Placebo Plus Chemotherapy for Previously Untreated Locally Recurrent Inoperable or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (MK-3475-355/KEYNOTE-355),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02819518,,COMPLETED,"The study will consist of two parts.

In Part 1, the safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with one of three different chemotherapies will be assessed in the treatment of locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which has not been previously treated with chemotherapy.

In Part 2, the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus background chemotherapy will be assessed compared to the safety and efficacy of placebo plus background chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC, which has not been previously treated with chemotherapy.

The primary hypotheses are that:

1. the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy prolongs Progression-Free Survival (PFS) compared to placebo and chemotherapy in:

   * all participants,
   * participants with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥1 tumors, and
   * participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 tumors, and
2. the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared to placebo and chemotherapy in:

   * all participants,
   * participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 tumors, and
   * participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 tumors.",YES,Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC),BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Normale Saline Solution,"Part 1: Percentage of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE) - All Participants, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 39 months|Part 1: Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE - All Participants, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 39 months|Part 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - All Participants, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on assessments by blinded independent central review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
