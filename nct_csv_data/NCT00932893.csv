CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 millimeter \[mm\] short axis). PR: at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Objective response is based on independent radiology review., Randomization until PD or initiation of antitumor therapy in the absence of PD or death, assessed every 6 weeks (up to 112 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at Week 6, Disease control: participants with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis). PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Disease control is based on independent radiology review., Week 6|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at Week 12, Disease control: participants with CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis). PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Week 12|Duration of Response (DR), Time in weeks from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7.02. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response., Randomization until PD or initiation of antitumor therapy in the absence of PD or death, assessed every 6 weeks (up to 112 weeks)|Time to Tumor Response (TTR), Time from date of randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response. TTR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with objective tumor response. Objective tumor response was defined as CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis). PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits., Randomization until PD or initiation of antitumor therapy in the absence of PD or death, assessed every 6 weeks (up to 112 weeks)|Plasma Concentration of Crizotinib, Only participants receiving crizotinib were to be analyzed for this outcome measure as per planned analysis., Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 5|Number of Participants With Categorical Maximum QTcF for Crizotinib, QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF): QT interval (time corresponding to the beginning of depolarization to re-polarization of the ventricles) divided by cube root of RR interval. Maximum QTcF was categorized as less than (\<) 450 milliseconds (msec), 450 msec to \<480 msec, 480 msec to \<500 msec, and more than or equal to (\>=) 500 msec. A participant is reported only once under the maximum QTcF interval observed at any of the time-points. Only participants receiving crizotinib were to be analyzed for this outcome measure as per planned analysis., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2 to 6 hours post-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2|Plasma Concentration of Soluble c-Met Ectodomain and Hepatocyte Growth Factor Scatter Proteins, Descriptive statistics (absolute value and change from baseline as measured by ratio to baseline) for each best overall response category (CR, PR, SD, PD or combined) have been used to summarize the data from optional soluble c-Met ectodomain assays for crizotinib treated patients., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2 to 6 hours post-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 2, end of treatment (up to 112 weeks)|Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Participant Reported Pain, Dyspnea, and Cough, TTD in pain (pain in chest from European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Supplement Module for Lung Cancer \[EORTC QLQ-LC13\]), dyspnea (from EORTC QLQ-LC13), or cough (from EORTC QLQ-LC13) symptoms was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest time the participant's score showed a 10 point or higher increase from baseline in any of the three symptoms from the instrument.
