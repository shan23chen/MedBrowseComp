NCT01136733,"A Study of E7080 Alone, and in Combination With Everolimus in Subjects With Unresectable Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Following One Prior Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-Targeted Treatment",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01136733,,COMPLETED,"This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of lenvatinib alone and in combination with everolimus in subjects with unresectable advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma following one prior VEGF-targeted treatment.",YES,Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma,DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Everolimus,"Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), A DLT was defined as either a treatment-related failure to administer greater than or equal to (\>=) 75% of the planned dosage of lenvatinib/everolimus or a specific National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) \>= Grade 3 (severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care daily living activities) hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities considered to be possibly related to lenvatinib and/or everolimus therapy assessed during the first treatment cycle of each dose level. Higher grade indicates more severe toxicity., First dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to end of first 4 weeks of therapy (Cycle 1)|Phase 1b: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 (RP2) Dose, The highest dose level resulting in 0 or 1 DLT in 6 participants was to be considered the MTD of Phase 1b. Once the MTD was established, the participant cohort was expanded to a minimum of 10 participants. The MTD was confirmed by assessing DLTs during Cycle 1 and intolerable toxicities (i.e., not manageable with dose interruption and/or reduction) during Cycle 2 of therapy. Once the dose of lenvatinib/everolimus combination to be used in the succeeding Phase 2 part of the study was established, enrollment into Phase 2 was started. The RP2 dose was the same as the confirmed MTD and was used for the Phase 2 Treatment Arm A of this study., First dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to end of Cycle 2 (1 cycle = 28 days/4 weeks)|Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dose of study drug to the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates were used to estimate median PFS, presented with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks (or sooner if there was evidence of progressive disease using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scan acquisition techniques (including use or nonuse of intravenous (IV) contrast). Tumor response was determined at the site by the investigator and radiologist using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in the evaluation of the tumor assessment scans. The date of objective disease progression was defined as the earliest date of radiological disease progression. Participants removed from therapy due to clinical progression with no radiologic confirmation were censored at their last radiologic assessment date., Date of randomization into Phase 2 (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first), assessed up to data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), up to approximately 2 years and 3 months","Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization until date of death from any cause. Median survival time was calculated using K-M estimate for each treatment arm and presented with 2-sided 95% CIs. Participants who were lost to follow-up or alive at the data cutoff date (10 Dec 2014) were censored at the date the participants were last known to be alive., Randomization (Cycle 1 Day 1) until date of death from any cause, assessed up to the data cutoff date (10 Dec 2014), up to approximately 2 years and 9 months|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had the best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1 in the evaluation of MRI or CT scans of targeted lesions. Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks (or sooner if there was evidence of progressive disease). The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until discontinuation from the study. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR = CR + PR was calculated with exact 95% CIs using the method of Clopper and Pearson., Randomization (Cycle 1 Day 1) until first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a BOR of CR or PR or SD (minimum duration from randomization to SD greater than or equal to 7 weeks). Assessments were performed every 8 weeks and were based on investigator review data using RECIST 1.1. The 95% CI was constructed using the method of Clopper and Pearson. DCR = CR + PR + SD greater than or equal to 7 weeks., Baseline (Randomization) to first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months|Durable Stable Disease (SD) Rate, The durable SD rate was defined as the percentage of participants whose BOR was SD and the duration of SD was greater than or equal to 23 weeks. The durable SD was based on investigator review data using RECIST 1.1. The 95% CI was constructed using the method of Clopper and Pearson., Baseline (Randomization) to first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The CBR was defined as the percentage of participants who had BOR of CR, PR, or durable SD (duration of SD was greater than or equal to 23 weeks) and was based on investigator review data using RECIST 1.1. The BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until discontinuation from the study. There was no requirement for confirmatory measurement of PR or CR to deem either one the BOR. The 95% CI was constructed using the method of Clopper and Pearson. CBR = CR + PR + SD greater than or equal to 23 weeks., Baseline (Randomization) to first evidence of disease progression, assessed up to the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014), or up to approximately 2 years and 3 months|Summary of Plasma Concentrations of Lenvatinib for Sparse Pharmacokinetic (PK) Sampling for Phase 1b and Phase 2, Blood samples were collected during the Randomization Phase. Most participants had 6 samples taken over 3 cycles of treatment (sparse sampling - 2 samples taken per cycle, one at predose and one at 2 to 8 hours postdose). Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were measured and concentration data were summarized. The summary statistics at time points with one or more below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) values were calculated by assigning zero for each BLQ value., Cycle 1 (Day 1), Cycle 2 (Day 1), Cycle 3 (Day 1)|Summary of Blood Concentrations of Everolimus for Sparse PK Sampling for Phase 1b and Phase 2, Blood samples were collected during the Randomization Phase.
