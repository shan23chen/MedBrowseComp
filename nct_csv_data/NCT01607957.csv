NCT01607957,Study of TAS-102 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Refractory to Standard Chemotherapies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01607957,RECOURSE,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of TAS-102 versus placebo in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.,YES,Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: TAS-102|DRUG: Placebo,"Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death for participants. If a participant discontinued study medication for reasons other than radiologic disease progression, the participant was followed for tumor response until radiologic disease progression or initiation of new anticancer therapy., Every 8 weeks, up to 12 months after the last participant was randomized or until the target number of events (deaths) was met, whichever was later. (Overall survival data was collected till 24 Jan 2014 which was date of observation of the 571st death)","Progression-free Survival, Tumor assessments were performed throughout the study based on RECIST, Version 1.1, 2009. Progression free survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization until the date of the investigator-assessed radiological disease progression or death due to any cause. For participants who were alive with no radiological disease progression as of the analysis cut-off date, their survival was censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Participants who received non-study cancer treatment before disease progression, or participants with clinical but not radiologic evidence of progression, were censored at the date of the last radiologic evaluable tumor assessment before the non-study cancer treatment was initiated., Every 8 weeks, up to 12 months after the last participant was randomized or until the date of the investigator-assessed radiological disease progression or death due to any cause,whichever was later. (Progression free survival cutoff: 31 Jan 2014)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), Treatment-Related AEs, Discontinuations, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Deaths, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-related AEs were events between administration of study drug and up to 30 Days that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability /incapacity; congenital anomaly. The AEs were graded for severity using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs., From the time of signing the informed consent form until the period of participant follow up (30 days following after the administration of last dose of study medication or until initiation of new antitumor therapy, whichever was earlier",,"Taiho Oncology, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,800,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",TPU-TAS-102-301|2012-000109-66,2012-06-17,2014-01-31,2016-05-23,2012-05-30,2019-05-21,2024-09-19,"Arizona Center for Cancer Care, Glendale, Arizona, 85306, United States|California Cancer Associates for Research and Excellence, Fresno, California, 93720, United States|Ronald H.
