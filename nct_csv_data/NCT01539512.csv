NCT01539512,"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Idelalisib in Combination With Rituximab for Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01539512,,COMPLETED,"This Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect of idelalisib in combination with rituximab on the onset, magnitude, and duration of tumor control in participants previously treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Eligible patients will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio into 1 of the 2 treatment arms to receive either idelalisib plus rituximab or placebo plus rituximab. Participants who are tolerating primary study therapy but experience definitive CLL progression are eligible to receive active idelalisib therapy in the extension study, GS-US-312-0117.",YES,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Placebo to match idelalisib,"Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the interval from randomization to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause. Definitive disease progression was CLL progression based on standard criteria (other than lymphocytosis alone) as defined by the 2008 update of the International Workshop on CLL guidelines, ie, appearance of any new lesion; increase by ≥ 50% in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of measured lymph nodes (SPD); new or ≥ 50% enlargement of liver or spleen; transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter's or prolymphocytic transformation); reduction in the number of blood cells (cytopenia) attributable to CLL., Up to 17 months","Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete response or partial response.

Complete response was defined as no lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly; normal complete blood count; confirmed by bone marrow aspirate \& biopsy.

Partial response was defined as \>1 of the following criteria: a 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, liver size, spleen size; plus ≥ 1 of the following: ≥ 1500/μL absolute neutrophil count, \> 100000/μL platelets, \> 11.0 g/dL hemoglobin or 50% improvement for either of these parameters without transfusions or growth factors., Up to 17 months|Lymph Node Response Rate, Lymph node response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the SPD of index lymph nodes., Up to 17 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the interval from randomization to death from any cause., Up to 17 months|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a complete response., Up to 17 months",,Gilead Sciences,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,220,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",GS-US-312-0116|2011-005180-24,2012-04,2013-10,2014-04,2012-02-27,2014-10-16,2019-05-14,"Clearview Cancer Institute, Huntsville, Alabama, 35805, United States|Arizona Oncology Associates, Tucson, Arizona, 85704, United States|University of California, San Diego- Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093, United States|Ventura County Hematology Oncology Specialists, Oxnard, California, 93030, United States|UCLA, Santa Monica, California, 90404, United States|Stanford Cancer Center, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Rocky Mountain Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Center, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|Georgetown University Medical Center Lombardi Cancer Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20057, United States|Collaborative Medical Research Corporation, Boynton Beach, Florida, 33435, United States|Collaborative Research Group LLC, Boynton Beach, Florida, 33435, United States|Florida Cancer Specialists, Fort Myers, Florida, 33916, United States|University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32610, United States|Florida Cancer Specialists, Saint Petersburg, Florida, 33705, United States|Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, 07601, United States|Hematology Oncology Associates of Northern New Jersey, Morristown, New Jersey, 07962, United States|Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York, 11042, United States|Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, 10021, United States|Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10065, United States|Willamette Valley Cancer Center, Springfield, Oregon, 97477, United States|Northwest Cancer Specialists, PC, Tualatin, Oregon, 97062, United States|Cancer Centers of the Carolinas, Greenville, South Carolina, 29605, United States|Sarah Cannon Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37203, United States|Texas Oncology, P.A., Fort Worth, Texas, 76104, United States|M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Cancer Care Network of South Texas, San Antonio, Texas, 78217, United States|Virginia Cancer Specialists, PC, Fairfax, Virginia, 22031, United States|Oncology and Hematology Associates of Southwest Virginia, Inc, Roanoke, Virginia, 24014, United States|Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington, 98109-1024, United States|Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital / North Star Lodge, Yakima, Washington, 98902, United States|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States|Hôpital Henri Mondor, Creteil, 94010, France|Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Lille (CHRU), Lille, 59045, France|Hôpital Emile Muller, Mulhouse, 68100, France|Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, 69495, France|Hôpital Pontchaillou, Rennes, 35019, France|Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, 76038, France|Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, 31059, France|Gemeinschaftspraxis Hämatologie-Onkologie, Dresden, 1307, Germany|Internistische Gemeinschaftspraxis, Erlangen, 91052, Germany|Universitätsklinikum Köln, Köln, 50937, Germany|Stauferklinikum Schwäb.
