NCT02494583,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as First-Line Monotherapy and Combination Therapy for Treatment of Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (MK-3475-062/KEYNOTE-062),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02494583,,COMPLETED,"This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as first-line treatment for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. Participants whose tumors express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms of the study: pembrolizumab as monotherapy \[pembro mono\], pembrolizumab plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine \[pembro combo\], or placebo plus SOC chemotherapy with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine \[SOC\].

The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab in combination with SOC chemotherapy is superior to SOC chemotherapy alone in terms of Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in participants with PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1, pembrolizumab in combination with SOC chemotherapy is superior to SOC chemotherapy alone in terms of OS in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, pembrolizumab monotherapy is non-inferior to SOC chemotherapy alone in terms of OS in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1, and pembrolizumab monotherapy is superior to SOC chemotherapy alone in terms of OS in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10.",YES,Gastric Adenocarcinoma,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Placebo,"Pembro Combo vs SOC: Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in Participants With PD-L1 CPS ≥1 (All Participants), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD.
