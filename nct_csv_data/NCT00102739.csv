NCT00102739,SB-497115 (Oral Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonist) Versus Placebo In Adults With Refractory Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00102739,,COMPLETED,"This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, repeat-dose, study conducted in two parts (Part A and Part B) examining 30, 50, and 75 mg doses of SB-497115-GR as a treatment for patients with ITP who have failed prior therapy. The study is designed to determine the proportion of patients with a platelet count =50,000/µL after 42 days. In Part B, 99 newly-recruited subjects will be randomized to one of two dosing arms in a 2:1 ratio of active:placebo. During the 6 week study period, subjects will start on placebo or active drug (50 mg) and may have a dose increase to 75 mg based upon their platelet count at day 22.",NO,"Purpura, Thrombocytopaenic, Idiopathic",DRUG: SB497115,"Treatment response, assessed by the proportion of patients with platelet counts of =50, 000/µL (compared with baseline count of <30, 000/µL) after 42 days of treatment.","Safety, tolerability, PK, PD, symptoms associated with ITP, and QoL, odds of response vs placebo during weeks 2 to 6 of the study.",,GlaxoSmithKline,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,99,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",TRA100773,2005-02,2007-01,2007-01,2005-02-02,,2013-04-15,"GSK Investigational Site, Bad Nauheim, Hessen, 61231, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Athens, 10676, Greece|GSK Investigational Site, Athens, Greece|GSK Investigational Site, Thessaloniki, 57010, Greece|GSK Investigational Site, Pokfulam, Hong Kong|GSK Investigational Site, Shatin, Hong Kong|GSK Investigational Site, Seoul, 136-705, Korea, Republic of|GSK Investigational Site, Seoul, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|GSK Investigational Site, Seoul, 140-743, Korea, Republic of|GSK Investigational Site, Auckland, 1701, New Zealand|GSK Investigational Site, Lahore, 54600, Pakistan|GSK Investigational Site, Lodz, 93-510, Poland|GSK Investigational Site, Bucharest, 022328, Romania|GSK Investigational Site, Bucharest, 050098, Romania|GSK Investigational Site, Moscow, 105 229, Russian Federation|GSK Investigational Site, Moscow, 125167, Russian Federation|GSK Investigational Site, Novosibirsk, 630087, Russian Federation|GSK Investigational Site, Ljubljana, 1000, Slovenia|GSK Investigational Site, Maribor, 2000, Slovenia|GSK Investigational Site, Taipei, 114, Taiwan|GSK Investigational Site, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand|GSK Investigational Site, ChiangMai, 50000, Thailand|GSK Investigational Site, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand|GSK Investigational Site, Reading, Berkshire, RG1 7AN, United Kingdom|GSK Investigational Site, Taunton, Somerset, TA1 5DA, United Kingdom|GSK Investigational Site, Liverpool, L7 8XP, United Kingdom|GSK Investigational Site, London, E1 1BB, United Kingdom|GSK Investigational Site, London, WC1E 6HX, United Kingdom|GSK Investigational Site, Manchester, M13 9WL, United Kingdom|GSK Investigational Site, Swansea, SA6 6NL, United Kingdom",
