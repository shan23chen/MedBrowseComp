NCT00024102,Comparison of Combination Chemotherapy Regimens in Treating Older Women Who Have Undergone Surgery for Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00024102,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways after surgery may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating older women with breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens to see how well they work in treating older women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer.",YES,Breast Cancer,DRUG: Standard Treatment|DRUG: capecitabine,"Relapse-free Survival Rates at 2.4 Years, Percentage of participants who were alive and relapse-free at time of analysis were counted as ""Alive without relapse"" at 2.4 years. Participants who had a first local recurrence, first distant metastasis or death from any cause were counted as ""relapse, first occurrence"". These rates were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method, randomization until date of first event, or date last known to be event free if no event was reported (up to 5 years)","Overall Survival Rate at 2.4 Years, Percentage of patients who were alive at 2.4 years. This rate was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method., Time from registration to death (up to 15 years)|Number of Participants With Grade 3, 4 or 5 Adverse Event at Least Possibly Related to Treatment., The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0 was used to evaluate toxicity.
