Patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio to treatment with buparlisib 100 mg daily in combination with fulvestrant 500 mg or placebo daily in combination with fulvestrant 500 mg. Randomization was stratified according to visceral disease status (present or absent).",YES,Metastatic Breast Cancer,DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: BKM120|DRUG: BKM120 matching placebo,"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on Local Investigator Assessment - Full Analysis Set (FAS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the analysis data cut-off or start of new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earliest of the cut-off date or the start date of additional anti-neoplastic therapy. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria RECIST v1.1, as 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline and/or unequivocal progression of the non-target lesions and/or appearance of a new lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Patients were followed up for approximately every 6 weeks after randomization., Every 6 weeks after randomization up to a maximum of 4 years","Overall Survival (OS) - Full Analysis Set (FAS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died by the date of analysis cut-off, OS was censored at the date of last known date patient alive. Patients were followed up approximately every 6 weeks after randomization and every 3 months during survival follow-up., Every 6 weeks after randomization up to a maximum of 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) by PIK3CA Mutational Status, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not progress or die at the time of the analysis data cut-off or start of new antineoplastic therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the earliest of the cut-off date or the start date of additional anti-neoplastic therapy. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria RECIST v1.1, as 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline and/or unequivocal progression of the non-target lesions and/or appearance of a new lesion. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Patients were followed up for approximately every 6 weeks after randomization., Every 6 weeks after randomization up to a maximum of 5 years|Overall Survival (OS) by PIK3CA Mutational Status, Overall Survival (OS) by PIK3CA mutational status based on ctDNA is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died by the date of analysis cut-off, OS was censored at the date of last known date patient alive. Patients were followed up approximately every 6 weeks after randomization and every 3 months during survival follow-up., Every 6 weeks after randomization up to a maximum of 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) by PIK3CA Mutational Status, Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1. ORR was analyzed in the full population and by PIK3CA mutational status based on ctDNA. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) for target/non target lesions: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target/non target lesions (all lymph nodes assigned as non-target lesions must be non-pathological in size (\< 10 mm short axis)); Partial response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions ; Overall Response (OR)= CR+PR. Patients were followed up for the duration of the study and for approximately every 6 weeks after randomization., Every 6 weeks after randomization up to a maximum of 5 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) by PIK3CA Mutational Status, Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) or Non-CR/non-PD lasting more than 14 or 24 weeks based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1. CBR was analyzed in the full population and by PIK3CA mutational status based on ctDNA. Patients were followed up for the duration of the study and approximately every 6 weeks after randomization., Week 14, Week 24|Long-term Safety and Tolerability in the Two Treatment Arms - Safety Set (SS), Analysis of frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (AE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Deaths., From first dose of study treatment to 30 days after last dose of study treatment, up to 5 years|Plasma Concentration-time Profiles of BKM120 in Combination With Fulvestrant at Cycle 1 Day 1 - Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS), Plasma samples were collected from the first 100 BKM120-treated patients on Cycle 1 Day 1 (at 1h, 2h, and 6h post-dose and a recommended 9h post-dose sample)., C1D1 1 hour post dose, C1D1 2 hour post dose, C1D1 6 hour post dose and C1D1 9 hour post dose|Predose Trough Concentration-time Profile of BKM120 in Combination With Fulvestrant Over Time - Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS), Pre-dose samples were collected for trough concentrations at Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 4 Day 1., C1D15, C2D1, C3D1 and C4D1|Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL):Time to 10% Definitive Deterioration in the Global Health Status/Quality of Life Per EORTC-QLQ-C30 - Full Analysis Set (FAS), The global health status/QoL scale score of the QLQ-C30 is identified as the primary PRO variable of interest. Physical Functioning (PF), Emotional Functioning (EF) and Social Functioning (SF) scale scores of the QLQ-C30. The time to definitive 10% deterioration is defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of an event, which is defined as a worsening (decrease) in score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study or death due to any cause. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high /healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL., Baseline, Week 6 (C2D15), Week 12 (C4D1), then every 8 weeks until discontinuation (a cycle [C] = 4 weeks) up to 5 years.|Time to Definitive Deterioration of ECOG Performance Status From Baseline - Full Analysis Set (FAS), The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status is a scale used to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. The ECOG Performance Scores has 5 grades: 0 = fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction, 1 = restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work, 2 = ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours, 3 = capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours, 4 = completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair and 5 = dead. Definitive deterioration is defined as no improvement in the ECOG status following observation of the deterioration., Screening, Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) and then at day 1 of each cycle and at the EOT visit",,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,432,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CBKM120F2303|2012-002571-34,2012-10-03,2016-05-23,2017-09-21,2012-07-04,2019-01-09,2019-01-30,"University of South Alabama / Mitchell Cancer Institute Univ South AL, Mobile, Alabama, 36688, United States|Ironwood Cancer and Research Centers SC, Chandler, Arizona, 85224, United States|Highlands Oncology Group, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|Compassionate Cancer Care Medical Group CCCMG, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|Los Angeles Hematology/Oncology Medical Group Onc Dept., Los Angeles, California, 90017, United States|Cedars Sinai Medical Center SC-5, Los Angeles, California, 90048, United States|University of California at Los Angeles UCLA SC, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Pacific Cancer Care, Monterey, California, 93940, United States|Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers SC, Denver, Colorado, 80218, United States|University Cancer & Blood Center, LLC, Athens, Georgia, 30607, United States|Emory University School of Medicine/Winship Cancer Institute Emory, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Moanalua Medical Center.
