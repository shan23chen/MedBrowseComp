Scores were averaged, and transformed to a 0-100 scale; for the future perspective scale, a higher score indicates a better perspective of the future., Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), then Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and Discontinuation visit|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Patients With Multiple Myeloma (EORTC QLQ-MY20) Body Image Scale, EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a validated questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma.

The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 3 levels of response: No problem (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions into a single utility index score. EQ-5D index values range from -0.59 to 1.00 where higher EQ-5D scores represent better health status. A positive change from baseline score indicates improvement in health status and better health state., Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), then Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and Discontinuation visit|Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU): Rate of Inpatient Hospitalizations Per Year, HRU was defined as any consumption of healthcare resources directly or indirectly related to the treatment of the patient. HRU Analysis may help in evaluating potential costs and budget impact of new treatments from a payer perspective. The rate of inpatient hospitalizations per patient year was calculated as the total number of hospitalizations divided by the total number of patient-years followed in the study period. Patient-years (PY) were calculated as the duration from baseline to last available HRQL assessment for each patient., Day 1 (randomization) up to last visit completed 25 July 2016|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) During the Active Treatment Phase, A TEAE is any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of any study drug, and within 30 days after the last dose of the last study drug. Severity grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) on a 1-5 scale: Grade 1= Mild AE, Grade 2= Moderate AE, Grade 3= Severe AE, Grade 4= Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5=Death related to AE. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that: • Results in death; • Is life-threatening; • Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Constitutes an important medical event., From first dose of study drug through 28 days following the discontinuation visit from active treatment phase; median duration of treatment was 80.2 weeks in the Rd arm;
