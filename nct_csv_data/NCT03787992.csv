NCT03787992,Alflutinib Mesylate Versus Gefitinib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer （FLAG）,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03787992,,UNKNOWN,To assess the efficacy and safety of Alflutinib Mesylate versus Gefitinib in patients with locally advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,NO,Locally Advanced or Metastatic EGFR Sensitising Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Alflutinib Mesylate (AST2818) 80mg//40 mg+ placebo|DRUG: Placebo Gefitinib 250 mg|DRUG: Gefitinib 250 mg|DRUG: Placebo AST2818 80mg//40 mg,"Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) (Months), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression and was used to assess the efficacy of single agent alflutinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy as measured by PFS., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 17 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression ( (approximately 12 months)","Overall Survival (OS)- Number of Participants With an Event, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death from any cause and was used to further assess the efficacy of alflutinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy, From first dose to end of study or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed every 6 weeks (approximately 29 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) evaluated by investigator, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression and was used to assess the efficacy of single agent alflutinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy as measured by PFS., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 17 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression (approximately 12 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the number (%) of patients with measurable disease with at least 1 visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) and it was used to further assess the efficacy of alflutinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy, At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 17 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression (approximately 12 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression and was used to further assess the efficacy of alflutinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 17 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression (approximately 12 months)|Depth of Response, The Depth of response was defined as the relative change in the sum of the longest diameters of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Target lesions (TLs) at the nadir, in the absence of new lesions (NLs) or progression of Non-target lesions (NTLs), compared to baseline and was used to further assess the efficacy of alflutinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy, At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 17 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression (approximately 12 months)|Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QLQ) Questionnaires Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13), The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was a lung-cancer-specific module comprising 13 questions to assess lung cancer symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and site-specific pain \[pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, and pain in other parts); treatment related side-effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia); and pain medication. Except for a multi-item scale for dyspnoea, all were single items. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items. Higher scores on the global health status/QoL and functioning scales indicated better health status/QoL and better function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden. The results of the analyses were presented in terms of a least squares mean together with its associated 95% profile likelihood CI, Questionnaires completed at week 1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15 , 18,21,27,33,39,45and51|Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 Items, he EORTC QLQ-C30 cancer-specific questionnaire consisted of 30 questions, which were combined to produce 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social); 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, Nausea/Vomiting); 6 individual items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties); and a global measure of health status/QoL. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items, the functional scales, and the global health status/QoL scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30. Higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicated better health status/function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden. The results of the analyses were presented in terms of a least squares mean together with its associated 95% profile likelihood CI., Questionnaires completed at week 1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15 , 18,21,27,33,39,45and51",,"Allist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,358,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",201801215,2019-05-30,2021-06,2022-06,2018-12-27,,2020-01-06,"cancer hospital Chinese academy of medical sciences, Beijing, China",
