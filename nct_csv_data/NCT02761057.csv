NCT02761057,"Testing Cabozantinib, Crizotinib, Savolitinib and Sunitinib in Kidney Cancer Which Has Progressed",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02761057,,COMPLETED,"This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib s-malate, crizotinib, savolitinib, or sunitinib malate work in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body. Cabozantinib s-malate, crizotinib, savolitinib, and sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving cabozantinib s-malate, crizotinib, or savolitinib will work better in treating patients with kidney cancer compared to sunitinib malate.",YES,Locally Advanced Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma|Metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma|Stage III Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v7|Type 1 Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma|Type 2 Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma|Unresectable Renal Cell Carcinoma,PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Bone Scan|DRUG: Cabozantinib S-malate|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Crizotinib|DRUG: Savolitinib|DRUG: Sunitinib Malate,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of appropriate diameters of target lesions over smallest sum observed, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, From date of registration to date of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration, or death due to any cause; assessed up to 3 years","Response Rate (RR), The response rate (RR) is defined as the combined rate of confirmed and unconfirmed partial response and confirmed and unconfirmed complete response. Complete response (CR) is defined as the complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, along with no new lesions. Partial response (PR) is defined as \>=30% decrease of the sum of appropriate diameters of all target measurable lesions, along with no new lesions., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Duration from date of randomization to date of death from any cause., Up to 3 years|Number of Participants With Gr 3 Through 5 Adverse Events That Are Related to Study Drugs, Only adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug are reported., Duration of treatment and follow up until death or 3 years post registration","MET Mutation Rate, The hazard ratio between the MET inhibitor versus (vs.) sunitinib in those with versus without the mutation (i.e., the interaction) will be compared.
