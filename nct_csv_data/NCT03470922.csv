Subjects who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death., From randomization to date of first documented tumor progression or death (up to approximately 33 months)","Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. For subjects that are alive, their survival time will be censored at the date of last contact (""last known alive date"")., From randomization to the date of death (up to approximately 3 years)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of randomized subjects who achieve a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on BICR assessments (using RECIST v1.1 criteria)., From randomization up to approximately 3 years","The Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), The number of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs).
