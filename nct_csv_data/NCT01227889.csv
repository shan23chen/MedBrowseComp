NCT01227889,A Study Comparing GSK2118436 to Dacarbazine (DTIC) in Previously Untreated Subjects With BRAF Mutation Positive Advanced (Stage III) or Metastatic (Stage IV) Melanoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01227889,,COMPLETED,"BRF113683 is a Phase III, randomized, open-label study comparing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GSK2118436 to dacarbazine (DTIC), in subjects with BRAF mutant advanced (Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) melanoma. Subjects will be randomized to receive 150 mg of GSK2118436 twice daily or 1000 mg/m2 DTIC every 3 weeks and continue on treatment until disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event. Subjects who progress on DTIC will be allowed to crossover to an optional extension arm of the study to receive GSK2118436.",YES,Cancer,DRUG: GSK2118436|DRUG: Dacarbazine (DTIC),"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator, PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause. Disease progression was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 millimeters (mm). For participants who did not progress or die, PFS was censored at the date of last contact. Data are presented as median and 96% confidence interval., Time interval between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause (up to 9.9 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by an Independent Radiologist: Randomized Phase, PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause. Disease progression was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by an independent radiologist according to RECIST version 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 mm. For participants who did not progress or die, PFS was censored at the date of last contact., Time interval between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause (up to 9.9 months)","Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the interval of time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. For participants who did not die, overall survival was censored at the date of last contact., Time interval between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause (up to 22.1 months)|Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Confirmed Partial Response (PR) as Assessed by the Investigator: Randomized Phase, A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters \[e.g., percent change from Baseline\]). Response was evaluated by an investigator per RECIST, version 1.1. A participant without a post-Baseline assessment of response was considered a non-responder. Confirmation, per RECIST version 1.1, requires a confimatory disease assessment of CR or PR at least 28 days after the initial disease assessment of CR or PR., From randomization until the first documented evidence of a confirmed complete response or partial response (median of 6.6 weeks)|Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Confirmed CR or PR as Assessed by an Independent Radiologist: Randomized Phase, A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters \[e.g., percent change from Baseline\]). Response was evaluated by an independent radiologist per RECIST, version 1.1. A participant without a post-Baseline assessment of response was considered a non-responder. Confirmation, per RECIST version 1.1, requires a confimatory disease assessment of CR or PR at least 28 days after the initial disease assessment of CR or PR., From randomization until the first documented evidence of a confirmed complete response or partial response (median of 12.0 weeks)|Duration of Response as Assessed by the Investigator: Randomized Phase, Duration of response for participants with either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters \[e.g., percent change from Baseline\]) was defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a PR or CR until the first documented sign of PD or death due to any cause. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 mm., Time from the first documented evidence of PR or CR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause (up to 65.6 weeks)|Duration of Response as Assessed by an Independent Radiologist: Randomized Phase, Duration of response for participants with either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters \[e.g., percent change from Baseline\]) was defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a PR or CR until the first documented sign of PD or death due to any cause. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 mm.
