NCT00113763,Evaluating Panitumumab (ABX-EGF) Plus Best Supportive Care Versus Best Supportive Care in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00113763,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine that panitumumab, using the proposed regimen, will safely increase progression free survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed available treatment options (i.e., patients who developed progressive disease or relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy).",YES,Colorectal Cancer|Metastases,OTHER: Best supportive care|DRUG: Panitumumab,"Progression-free Survival Time, Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time from randomization to either death or first observed disease progression, whichever occurred first. Participants were evaluated for tumor response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based on the response assessment from a blinded review of radiographic scans by the Independent Review Committee. Progressive disease defined as least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 30 June 2005. The median follow-up time was 20.0 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 18.2 weeks in the BSC alone group.","Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time from randomization to death., From randomization until the data cut-off date for overall survival of 15 March 2006. The median actual follow-up time was 30 weeks for the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31 weeks for the BSC alone group.|Objective Tumor Response, Defined as the number of participants with a confirmed complete or partial tumor response, confirmed by a scan no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Participants were evaluated for tumor response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based on the response assessment from a blinded review of radiographic scans by the Independent Review Committee. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response (PR): disappearance of all target lesions, and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD, with no progressive disease of non-target lesions., From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29.6 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31.8 weeks in the BSC alone group.|Duration of Response, Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from first confirmed objective tumor response to first observed progression of disease or death due to progression of disease (whichever comes first)., From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29.6 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31.8 weeks in the BSC alone group.|Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the time from randomization to first partial or complete response, subsequently confirmed â‰¥ 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met., From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29.6 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31.8 weeks in the BSC alone group.|Time to Disease Progression, Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time from randomization to disease progression or death due to disease progression (whichever occurs first), From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29.6 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31.8 weeks in the BSC alone group.|Time to Treatment Failure, Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to the date the decision was made to end treatment for any reason., From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29.6 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31.8 weeks in the BSC alone group.|Duration of Stable Disease, Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to date of first observed progression of disease or death due to progression of disease (whichever comes first) for those participants with a best response of stable disease. Stable disease defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as reference the nadir longest diameter since the treatment started, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesions., From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29.6 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31.8 weeks in the BSC alone group.",,Amgen,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,463,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,20020408,2004-01-01,2008-10-01,2009-06-01,2005-06-13,2014-01-03,2022-11-07,,
