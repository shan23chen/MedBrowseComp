NCT02504372,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) vs Placebo for Participants With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Resection With or Without Standard Adjuvant Therapy (MK-3475-091/KEYNOTE-091),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02504372,PEARLS,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"In this study, participants with Stage IB/II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have undergone surgical resection (lobectomy or pneumonectomy) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy will be treated with pembrolizumab or placebo. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will provide improved disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo.",YES,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|OTHER: Placebo,"Disease-Free Survival (DFS), DFS was defined as the time from randomization to either the date of disease recurrence or death (whatever the cause) as assessed by the investigator. Recurrence of disease was defined as local regional recurrence, a distant (metastatic) recurrence, or a second primary cancer. Occurrence of a second extra-pulmonary malignancy was considered to be an event., Up to approximately 84 months|DFS in Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PDL-1) Strong Positive Participants With Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥50%, DFS in PDL-1 strong positive participants with TPS ≥50% was defined as the time from randomization to either the date of disease recurrence or death (whatever the cause) as assessed by the investigator. Recurrence of disease was defined as local regional recurrence, a distant (metastatic) recurrence, or a second primary cancer. Occurrence of a second extra-pulmonary malignancy was considered to be an event., Up to approximately 84 months","DFS in PDL-1 Strong Positive Participants With TPS ≥1%, DFS in PDL-1 strong positive participants with TPS ≥1% was defined as the time from randomization to either the date of disease recurrence or death (whatever the cause) as assessed by the investigator. Recurrence of disease was defined as local regional recurrence, a distant (metastatic) recurrence, or a second primary cancer. Occurrence of a second extra-pulmonary malignancy was considered to be an event., Up to approximately 84 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death., Up to approximately 132 months|OS in PDL-1 Strong Positive Participants With TPS ≥50%, OS in PDL-1 Strong Positive Participants with TPS ≥50% was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death., Up to approximately 132 months|OS in PDL-1 Strong Positive Participants With TPS ≥1%, OS in PDL-1 Strong Positive Participants with TPS ≥1% was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death., Up to approximately 132 months|Lung Cancer Specific Survival (LCSS), LCSS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death (due to lung cancer specifically)., Up to approximately 132 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol specified procedure. The number of participants who experienced an AE were reported., Up to approximately 22 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol specified procedure. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE were reported., Up to approximately 19 months","DFS at 68 Months, DFS was defined as the time from randomization to either the date of disease recurrence or death (whatever the cause) as assessed by the investigator.
