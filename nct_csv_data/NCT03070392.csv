NCT03070392,Safety and Efficacy of IMCgp100 Versus Investigator Choice in Advanced Uveal Melanoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03070392,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"To evaluate the overall survival of HLA-A\*0201 positive adult patients with previously untreated advanced UM receiving IMCgp100 compared to Investigator's Choice of dacarbazine, ipilimumab, or pembrolizumab.",YES,Uveal Melanoma,BIOLOGICAL: IMCgp100|DRUG: Dacarbazine|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab,"Efficacy: Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to any cause., From randomization to the data cut off date of 13-Oct-2020; median follow-up duration was 14.1 months.","Safety: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Safety was defined as the number of participants with treatment emergent adverse events, including laboratory abnormalities, ECG changes, and/or physical examination findings., Safety was assessed from informed consent through 90 days after end of treatment, up to 36 months.|Efficacy: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of progression (RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause., PFS was assessed every 3 months from randomization until disease progression or death, up to 36 months.|Quality-of-Life: Change From Baseline in EQ-5D,5L Domain Scores, General health status was assessed using the EQ-5D,5L questionnaire, which includes five dimensions (5D): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 scoring levels, where 1 indicates a better health state (no problems) and 3 indicates a worse health state. A positive change indicates improvement., EQ-5D,5L was assessed at baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) and on Day 1 of every other cycle to Cycle 5 Day 1, every fourth cycle thereafter, beginning with Cycle 9 Day 1 and End of Treatment (EOT), up to 36 months. Each cycle is 21 days.|Quality-of-life: Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Visual Analogue Score (VAS), The EQ-5D VAS score records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state and 100 being the best imaginable health state. A positive change indicates improvement., EQ-5D,5L VAS was assessed at baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) and on Day 1 of every other cycle to Cycle 5 Day 1, every fourth cycle thereafter, beginning with Cycle 9 Day 1 and End of Treatment (EOT), up to 36 months. Each cycle is 21 days.|Quality-of-Life: Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status, Global health status and quality of life was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The score range for the EORTC QLQ-C30 is from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning and better global health status and health-related quality of life. A positive change indicates improvement., EORTC QLQ-C30 was assessed at baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) and on Day 1 of every other cycle to Cycle 5 Day 1, every fourth cycle thereafter, beginning with Cycle 9 Day 1 and End of Treatment (EOT), up to 36 months. Each cycle is 21 days.|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Tebentafusp Concentration, Serum PK concentrations of tebentafusp were collected over time., PK concentrations were assessed at pre-dose, end of infusion and anytime in the 12 to 24 hour window after completion of the infusion in Cycle 1 on Days 1, 8 and 15.|Efficacy: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (RECIST v1.1)., ORR will be assessed after every participant has had at least 3 assessments, conducted every 3 months, up to 5.5 years.|Efficacy: Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from first documented objective response (RECIST v1.1) until the date of documented disease progression., DOR will be assessed every 3 months from randomization until disease progression, assessed up to 5.5 years.|Efficacy: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with either an objective response or stable disease (RECIST v1.1), DCR will be assessed every 3 months from randomization until disease progression, up to 5.5 years.|Pharmacokinetics: Frequency of Anti-IMCgp100 Antibody Formation, Approximately 5 assessments will be performed between first dose of IMCgp100 and end of treatment, assessed up to 5.5 years.",,Immunocore Ltd,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,378,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IMCgp100-202,2017-10-16,2020-10-13,2025-06,2017-03-03,2021-09-14,2024-12-03,"UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, 90024, United States|The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Los Angeles, California, 90025, United States|Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, 94303, United States|California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, California, 94115, United States|University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|University of Miami - Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|The University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, 14263, United States|Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10065, United States|Duke University Health System, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States|University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 73104, United States|Portland Providence Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, 97213, United States|Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107, United States|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15232, United States|Houston Methodist Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Saint Vincents Hospital, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, 2010, Australia|Central Adelaide Local Health Network, Royal Adelaide Hospital Cancer Center, Adelaide, South Australia, 5000, Australia|Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia|Institut Roi Albert II Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Bruxelles, Belgium|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, M5G 2M9, Canada|Centre Atoine Lacassagne, Nice, 6189, France|Institut Curie, Paris, 75005, France|Universitaetsklinikum Koeln Dermatologie und Venerologie, Koeln, Nordrhein Westfalen, 50937, Germany|Charite - Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, 12200/12203, Germany|Universitätsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, 01307, Germany|University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany|University of Hamburg, Hamburg, 20246, Germany|Nationales Centrum für Tumorerkrankungen, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany|Klinik und Poliklinik für Dermatologie und Allergologie, Munich, 80337, Germany|Fondazione ICCRS, Milan, 20133, Italy|Istituto Nazionale Tumori - IRCCS Fondazione ""G.
