NCT00021255,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00021255,,COMPLETED,"Primary objective:

* Compare disease-free survival in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-neu-expressing node-positive or high-risk node-negative operable breast cancer treated with adjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin) vs trastuzumab, docetaxel, and carboplatin.

Secondary objective:

* Compare overall survival of participants treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxic effects (including cardiac) of these regimens in these participants.
* Compare quality of life of participants treated with these regimens.
* Compare pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy of these regimens in these participants.
* For substudy: Compare peripheral levels of shed HER2-neu extracellular domain with fluorescence in situ hybridization in predicting outcome in participants treated with these regimens.",YES,Breast Neoplasms,DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Herceptin|DRUG: Carboplatin,"Percentage of Participants With Disease Free Survival at 5 Years, Disease Free Survival was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of local, regional or metastatic relapse or the date of second primary cancer (with the exception of curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix) or death from any cause whichever occured first.
