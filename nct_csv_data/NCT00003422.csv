NCT00003422,Radiation Therapy Before Surgery Compared With Chemotherapy Plus Radiation After Surgery in Treating Patients With Rectal Cancer That Can Be Surgically Removed,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003422,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy before surgery is more effective than giving chemotherapy plus radiation therapy after surgery in treating patients with rectal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy given before surgery to see how well it works compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy given after surgery in treating patients with rectal cancer that can be surgically removed.",NO,Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: leucovorin calcium|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|PROCEDURE: neoadjuvant therapy|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Local recurrence by biopsy, imaging, or imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen result",Local recurrence-free survival|Overall survival|Time to appearance of distant metastases|Disease-free survival|Morbidity|Quality of life|Economic implications,,Medical Research Council,NCIC Clinical Trials Group,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1800,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000066442|MRC-CR07|EU-98008|CAN-NCIC-C016|ISRCTN28785842,1998-01,,2010-06,2003-01-27,,2013-12-04,"Tom Baker Cancer Centre - Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|Saint John Regional Hospital, Saint John, New Brunswick, E2L 4L2, Canada|Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario at Kingston General Hospital, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 5P9, Canada|Ottawa Hospital Regional Cancer Centre - General Campus, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 1C4, Canada|St. Catharines General Hospital at Niagara Health System, St. Catharines, Ontario, L2R 5K3, Canada|Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Hopital Charles Lemoyne, Greenfield Park, Quebec, J4V 2H1, Canada|Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland, DD1 9SY, United Kingdom",
