NCT00084318,Adjuvant Cetuximab and Chemoradiotherapy Using Either Cisplatin or Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Resected Stage III or Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma or Lymphoepithelioma of the Head and Neck,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00084318,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Cisplatin and docetaxel may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining a monoclonal antibody with chemoradiotherapy and giving them after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying adjuvant cetuximab given together with chemoradiotherapy using cisplatin to see how well it works compared to adjuvant cetuximab given together with chemoradiotherapy using docetaxel in treating patients with resected stage III or stage IV squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) or lymphoepithelioma of the head and neck.",YES,Head and Neck Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: cetuximab|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: docetaxel|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Disease-free Survival, Two-year rates are shown (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Disease-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to local, regional, or distant progression, second primary, or death (event) or last follow-up (censored). Response criteria as follows: No evidence of disease (NED): All patients must have no measurable tumor following surgery; Local-Regional Relapse: Recurrent cancer in the tumor bed and/or neck not clearly attributable to a second primary neoplasm; biopsy confirmation is necessary; Distant Relapse: Clear evidence of distant metastases (lung, bone, brain, etc.); Biopsy is recommended where possible. A solitary lung mass/nodule is considered a second primary neoplasm unless proven otherwise., From randomization to 2 years","Overall Survival, Two-year rates are shown (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death (event) or last follow-up (censored)., From randomization to 2 years|Treatment Tolerance, Tolerability was defined as having received 90% of the radiation dose, 95% of the cetuximab loading dose, and at least 4 weeks of cetuximab and cisplatin or docetaxel at doses 95% of the protocol prescription. The percentage of patients determined to be tolerant of treatment are shown., From start of treatment to end of treatment (protocol treatment lasts seven weeks).|Frequency of Toxicity (Grade 5 and Acute Non-hematologic Grade 4), Each regimen was monitored for excessive acute toxicity (defined as nonhematologic grade 4 toxicity within 90 days of the start of radiation or any grade 5 toxicity). The target rate was based on the observed rate from RTOG-9501/NCT00002670 of 15%. The unacceptable rate was \>30%. \[RTOG = Radiation Therapy Oncology Group\], From start of treatment to last follow-up. Analysis occurs at the time of the primary analysis.|Frequency of Other Acute and Late Toxicity, Maximum grade toxicity that is definitely, probably, or possibly related to protocol treatment., From start of treatment to last follow-up. Analysis occurs at the time of the primary endpoint analysis.|Local-regional Control, Two-year rate is shown (cumulative incidence estimate). Local-regional failure is defined as the time from randomization to local-regional recurrence (event), death (competing risk), or last follow-up (censored)., From randomization to 2 years|Correlation of EGFR (Total and Phosphorylated) pMAPK, pAKT, Stat-3, KI-67, COX-2, and Cyclin B1 Expression With Local-regional Control, and Overall and Disease-free Survival, From randomization to two years",,Radiation Therapy Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|NRG Oncology,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,238,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,RTOG-0234|CDR0000360850,2004-04,2009-03,2016-12,2004-06-11,2016-11-22,2018-12-12,"University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, Alabama, 35294, United States|Mobile Infirmary Medical Center, Mobile, Alabama, 36652-2144, United States|Arizona Oncology Services Foundation, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|Virginia G.
