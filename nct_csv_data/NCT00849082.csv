NCT00849082,Radiation Therapy With or Without Goserelin and Cyproterone in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00849082,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as goserelin and cyproterone, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body and reduces the amount of androgens available to the body. It is not yet know whether radiation therapy alone is more effective than radiation therapy given together with goserelin and cyproterone in treating patients with prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to giving radiation therapy together with goserelin and cyproterone in treating patients with prostate cancer that is at high risk for metastasis.",NO,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: cyproterone acetate|DRUG: goserelin acetate|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Disease-free survival|Survival|Toxicity/morbidity of treatment,|Locoregional remission rate|Time to treatment failure",,,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,,MALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: |Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EORTC-22863|EORTC-22863,1987-05,1995-11,,2009-02-23,,2012-07-11,,
