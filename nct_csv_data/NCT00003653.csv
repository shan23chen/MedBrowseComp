NCT00003653,Hormone Therapy in Treating Patients With Rising PSA Levels Following Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003653,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It is not yet known which androgen suppression regimen is more effective for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two hormone therapy regimens and comparing them to see how well they work in treating patients with rising PSA levels following radiation therapy for prostate cancer.",NO,Prostate Cancer,DRUG: bicalutamide|DRUG: buserelin|DRUG: cyproterone acetate|DRUG: flutamide|DRUG: goserelin|DRUG: leuprolide acetate|DRUG: nilutamide,"Overall survival, 2 years","Time to hormone resistance, 2 years|Quality of life by European Organization for Research of the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30+ (EORTC QLQ-C30+) trial specific checklist, 2 years|Serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein levels, 2 years|Duration of treatment and non-treatment interval during intermittent androgen suppression arm only, 2 years|Time to testosterone recovery during intermittent androgen suppression arm only, 2 years|Time to recovery of potency during intermittent androgen suppression arm only, 2 years",,NCIC Clinical Trials Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI)|SWOG Cancer Research Network,MALE,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1386,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,PR7|CAN-NCIC-PR7|SWOG-JPR7|ICR-CTSU-JPR7|CDR0000066745,1999-01-05,2010-10-04,2013-01-10,2003-01-27,,2021-06-23,"Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|BCCA - Cancer Centre for the Southern Interior, Kelowna, British Columbia, V1Y 5L3, Canada|BCCA - Fraser Valley Cancer Centre, Surrey, British Columbia, V3V 1Z2, Canada|Clinical Research Unit at Vancouver Coastal, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 1M9, Canada|BCCA - Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|The Vitalite Health Network - Dr. Leon Richard, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 8X3, Canada|Atlantic Health Sciences Corporation, Saint John, New Brunswick, E2L 4L2, Canada|Dr. H.
