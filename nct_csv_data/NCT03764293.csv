NCT03764293,A Study to Evaluate SHR-1210 in Combination With Apatinib as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced HCC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03764293,,COMPLETED,"This is a randomized, open-label, international, multi-center, phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 plus apatinib mesylate versus sorafenib as first-line therapy in patients with advanced HCC.",YES,Locally Advanced or Metastatic and Unresectable HCC,DRUG: SHR-1210|DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: Sorafenib,"Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Evaluated by the Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) Based on RECIST v1.1, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) by tumor image evaluation or death from any cause whichever occurs first as determined by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of \>/= 5 millimeters (mm), or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to approximately 3 years","Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the percentage of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based on RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. Overall Response (OR)=CR+PR., Up to approximately 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR defined as the percentage of subjects with complete response, partial response or stable disease (SD) ≥ 8 weeks evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based on RECIST v1.1. Complete response (CR) was defined as Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as time from the date of first record of objective response (CR or PR) to the first occurrence of radiological progression or death, whichever comes first, evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based on RECIST v1.1. Complete response (CR) was defined as Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
