NCT01908426,Study of Cabozantinib (XL184) vs Placebo in Subjects With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who Have Received Prior Sorafenib,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01908426,CELESTIAL,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Cabozantinib (XL184) compared with placebo on overall survival in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have received prior sorafenib.,YES,Hepatocellular Carcinoma,DRUG: Cabozantinib tablets|DRUG: Placebo tablets,"Overall Survival (OS), The primary analysis of OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. The analysis was based on a second planned interim analysis prespecified to be performed at approximately the 75% information fraction (ie, at approximately 466 deaths). The data cutoff date for this event-driven analysis in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population was 01 June 2017. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimates., Up to 45 months","Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Duration of PFS is defined as the time of randomization to the earlier of the following events, progressive disease as determined by Investigator (per RECIST 1.0, which is defined by a ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from baseline) or death due to any cause. A Kaplan- Meier analysis was performed to estimate the median duration., Up to 45 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., ORR is measured by radiologic assessment every 8 weeks after randomization until disease progression or discontinuation of study treatment (up to 45 months)",,Exelixis,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,707,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",XL184-309,2013-09-26,2017-10-16,2021-01-12,2013-07-25,2019-03-01,2021-05-06,"Corona, California, 92879, United States|Los Angeles, California, 90033, United States|San Diego, California, 92123, United States|San Francisco, California, 94115, United States|Gainesville, Florida, 32610, United States|Atlanta, Georgia, 30318, United States|Honolulu, Hawaii, 96815, United States|Chicago, Illinois, 60637, United States|Burlington, Massachusetts, 01805, United States|Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Kansas City, Missouri, 64128, United States|Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Las Vegas, Nevada, 89109, United States|East Orange, New Jersey, 07018, United States|New York, New York, 10032, United States|New York, New York, 10065, United States|Valhalla, New York, 10595, United States|Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|San Antonio, Texas, 78215, United States|Seattle, Washington, 98104, United States|Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|Spokane, Washington, 99208, United States|Camperdown, New South Wales, 2050, Australia|Concord, New South Wales, 2139, Australia|Darlinghurst, New South Wales, 2010, Australia|Kogarah, New South Wales, 2217, Australia|Westmead, New South Wales, 2145, Australia|Kurralta Park, South Australia, 5037, Australia|Melbourne, Victoria, 3050, Australia|Perth, Western Australia, 6000, Australia|Edegem, Antwerpen, 2650, Belgium|La Louvière, Hainaut, 7100, Belgium|Gent, Oost-Vlaanderen, 9000, Belgium|Liege, 4000, Belgium|Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 4H4, Canada|Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, 6202, France|Amiens, Somme, 80054, France|Creteil, Val-de-Marne, 94010, France|Besançon, 25000, France|Bordeaux, 33075, France|Clermont-Ferrand, 63003, France|Lille, 59037, France|Lyon, 69317, France|Esslingen am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg, 73730, Germany|Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, 72076, Germany|München, Bayern, 81675, Germany|Frankfurt am Main, Hessen, 60590, Germany|Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, 39120, Germany|Berlin, 13353, Germany|Freiburg, Germany|Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Dublin, 7, Ireland|Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, 40138, Italy|Faenza, Emilia-Romagna, 48018, Italy|Meldola, Emilia-Romagna, 47014, Italy|Rimini, Emilia-Romagna, 47900, Italy|Roma, Lazio, 128, Italy|Roma, Lazio, 168, Italy|Genova, Liguria, 16132, Italy|Milan, Lombardia, 20122, Italy|Rozzano, Lombardia, 20089, Italy|Palermo, Sicilia, 90127, Italy|Padova, Veneto, 35128, Italy|Goyang, Gyeonggido, 410-769, Korea, Republic of|Busan, 602-739, Korea, Republic of|Seongnam, 463-707, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 110-744, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 120-752, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 135-710, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 136-705, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 137-701, Korea, Republic of|Seoul, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|Suwon-si, 443-721, Korea, Republic of|Maastricht, Limburg, 6229 HX, Netherlands|Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, 1081 HV, Netherlands|Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, 1105 AZ, Netherlands|Leiden, Zuid-Holland, 2333 ZA, Netherlands|Auckland, North Island, 1003, New Zealand|Olsztyn, Warminsko-Mazurskie, 10-513, Poland|Myslowice, 41-400, Poland|Poznan, 60-569, Poland|Cluj-Napoca, Cluj, 400015, Romania|Brasov, 500019, Romania|Singapore, 119074, Singapore|Singapore, 169610, Singapore|Singapore, 308433, Singapore|Elche, Alicante, 3293, Spain|Majadahonda, Madrid, 28222, Spain|Torrejon de Ardoz, Madrid, 28850, Spain|Madrid, 28007, Spain|Madrid, 28041, Spain|Zaragoza, 50009, Spain|Liuying Township, Tainan, 736, Taiwan|Taichung, 40705, Taiwan|Taipei, 100, Taiwan|Edirne, 22030, Turkey|Gaziantep, 27100, Turkey|Wirral, England, CH63 4JY, United Kingdom|Birmingham, B15 2TH, United Kingdom|London, NW3 2QG, United Kingdom|London, SE5 9RS, United Kingdom|Manchester, M20 4BX, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/26/NCT01908426/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/26/NCT01908426/SAP_001.pdf"
