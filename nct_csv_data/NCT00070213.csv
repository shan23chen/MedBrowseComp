NCT00070213,Leucovorin and Fluorouracil With or Without Oxaliplatin Compared to Capecitabine With or Without Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00070213,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin, fluorouracil, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin is more effective than capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying four different chemotherapy regimens to compare how well they work in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.",NO,Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: FOLFOX regimen|DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: leucovorin calcium|DRUG: oxaliplatin|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment,"Compare progression-free survival (PFS) in pts. treated w/ leucovorin calcium + fluorouracil (MdG) vs leucovorin calcium + fluorouracil + oxaliplatin (OxMdG) and in pts. treated w/ capecitabine (Cap) vs capecitabine + oxaliplatin (OxCap) at 1 yr, Compare progression-free survival (PFS) in pts. treated w/ leucovorin calcium + fluorouracil (MdG) vs leucovorin calcium + fluorouracil + oxaliplatin (OxMdG) and in pts. treated w/ capecitabine (Cap) vs capecitabine + oxaliplatin (OxCap) at 1 yr, PFS|Compare health assessment in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap at baseline and 14 weeks, Compare health assessment in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap at baseline and 14 weeks, Baseline and 14 weeks","Compare health assessment, including quality of life, in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap at baseline and 14 and 24 weeks, Compare health assessment, including quality of life, in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap at baseline and 14 and 24 weeks, Baseline, 14 and 24 weeks|Compare toxicity/adverse events in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, Compare toxicity/adverse events in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, post 24 weeks|Compare overall failure-free survival in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, Compare overall failure-free survival in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, post 24 weeks|Compare overall survival in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, Compare overall survival in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, post 24 weeks|Compare health economics in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, Compare health economics in patients treated with MdG vs OxMdG and in patients treated with Cap vs OxCap, Baseline, 14 and 24 weeks|Compare health assessment in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap, Baseline, 14 and 24 weeks|Compare toxicity/adverse events in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap at baseline and 24 weeks, Compare toxicity/adverse events in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap at baseline and 24 weeks, Baseline and 24 weeks|Compare patients acceptability in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap, Compare patients acceptability in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap, post 24 weeks|Compare PFS in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap, Compare PFS in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap, post 24 weeks|Compare health economics in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap, Compare health economics in patients treated with MdG vs Cap and in patients treated with OxMdG vs OxCap, Baseline, 14 and 24 weeks",,Medical Research Council,University of Leeds,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,460,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000330142|NCRI-FOCUS2|MRC-CR09|EU-20303,2003-09,2011-06-01,2011-06-01,2003-10-07,,2021-09-27,"Cookridge Hospital, Leeds, England, LS16 6QB, United Kingdom|Clinical Trials and Research Unit of the University of Leeds, Leeds, England, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom|Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, London, England, NW1 2DA, United Kingdom|Velindre Cancer Center at Velindre Hospital, Cardiff, Wales, CF14 2TL, United Kingdom",
