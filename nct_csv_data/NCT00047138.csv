NCT00047138,Chemotherapy Before and After Surgery in Treating Children With Wilm's Tumor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00047138,,UNKNOWN,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so it can be removed during surgery. Giving more chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen after surgery is most effective in treating Wilm's tumor.
