NCT02048865,Apixaban for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Cancer Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02048865,AVERT,COMPLETED,"Cancer patients have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins compared to non-cancer patients. Cancer patients who develop blood clots can lead to reduced life expectancy, delayed cancer treatment, and decreased quality of life. Prevention is the most effective way to decrease the complications associated with blood clots in the veins. Although previous clinical trials have shown some benefit on the use of medication to prevent blood clots in the veins in ambulatory cancer patients, these studies have been inconclusive in demonstrating that existing blood thinners significantly reduce the rate of blood clots in cancer patients. One possible explanation relates to the fact that these studies have included a large proportion of cancer patients who are a low risk of developing blood clots in the veins. We are proposing to identify cancer patients who are at a high risk of developing blood clots by using a validated tool at the time of their cancer diagnosis. The identified high risk cancer patients will be asked to participate in a trial to test the safety and efficacy of a new oral medication that has been used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing surgery. We are enrolling 574 patients in 7 Canadian centers (Ottawa, Halifax, Montreal, Vancouver, Sault Ste. Marie, Toronto and Hamilton). 287 patients will receive the study drug and 287 will receive an inactive substance. Analysis will be performed to assess the safety and the superiority of the study drug.",NO,Venous Thromboembolism|Cancer,DRUG: Apixaban|DRUG: Placebo drug,"first episode of objectively documented, symptomatic or asymptomatic VTE (DVT and/or PE), 7 months","Rate of adverse events, rate of clinical overt bleeding( major and minor bleeding) and death within the study period, 7 months",,Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)|Bristol-Myers Squibb,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,575,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",OHSN-20130563-01H|CV185-245,2014-03-24,2018-10-10,2018-10-19,2014-01-29,,2018-11-20,"Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 1M9, Canada|Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1V7, Canada|Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH), Barrie, Ontario, L4M 6M2, Canada|William Osler Health System -Brampton, Brampton, Ontario, L6R 3J7, Canada|Juravinski Hospital & Cancer Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 1C3, Canada|Kingston General Hospital, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 2V7, Canada|London Health Sciences Center, London, Ontario, N6A 5W9, Canada|Lakeridge Health -Oshawa, Oshawa, Ontario, Canada|Ottawa Hospital-General Campus, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada|Sault Area Hospital, Sault Ste.
