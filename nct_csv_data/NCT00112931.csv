NCT00112931,"Rituximab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00112931,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether rituximab is more effective than observation in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying rituximab to see how well it works compared to observation in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage II, stage III, or stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with no symptoms.",NO,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|OTHER: No treatment,"Time until initiation of therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy), Time from randomisation until the first day systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy is given. If rituximab is given to patients in the watch and wait arm this will be considered as initiation of chemotherapy.","Frequency of clinical spontaneous remission, From randomisation until the initiation of chemotherapy in the watch and wait arm|Cause specific survival, Time from randomisation to death from lymphoma or immediate therapy related toxicity|Overall survival, Time from randomisation to death from any cause.|Response rate at 25 months, Response at 25 months",,"University College, London",Cancer Research UK|Roche Pharma AG,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,462,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000427312|CRUK-2004-001621-16|EU-20509|ROCHE-CRUK-001621-16,2004-09,2014-03,2023-09-14,2005-06-03,,2024-05-09,"Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide, Australia|Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia|Ashford Cancer Centre, Black Forest, Australia|Boxhill Hospital, Box Hill, Australia|Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia|Canberra Hospital, Canberra, Australia|Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Concord, Australia|Frankston Hospital, Frankston, Australia|Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle, Australia|Gosford Hospital, Gosford, Australia|Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Australia|Nepean Hospital, Kingswood, Australia|Lismore Base Hospital, Lismore, Australia|Liverpool Hospital, Liverpool, Australia|Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia|Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia|Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia|St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia|Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Newcastle, Australia|Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia|Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Australia|St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia|Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia|Murray Valley Private Hospital, Wodonga, Australia|Wollongong Hospital, Wollongong, Australia|Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Australia|Auckland Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand|Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand|Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand|North Shore Hospital, Westlake, New Zealand|Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, England, B9 5SS, United Kingdom|Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, England, FY3 8NR, United Kingdom|West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St. Edmunds, England, IP33 2QZ, United Kingdom|Kent and Canterbury Hospital, Canterbury, England, CT1 3NG, United Kingdom|St. Helier Hospital, Carshalton, England, SM5 1AA, United Kingdom|Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, Exeter, England, EX2 5DW, United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, England, NE9 6SX, United Kingdom|Medway Maritime Hospital, Gillingham, England, ME7 5NY, United Kingdom|Hemel Hempstead General, Hemel Hempstead, England, HP2 4AD, United Kingdom|Hull Royal Infirmary, Hull, England, HU3 2KZ, United Kingdom|West Middlesex University Hospital, Isleworth, England, TW7 6AF, United Kingdom|Kettering General Hosptial, Kettering, England, NNI6 8UZ, United Kingdom|Kidderminster Hospital, Kidderminster, England, DY11 6RJ, United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, England, PE30 4ET, United Kingdom|Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, England, LE1 5WW, United Kingdom|St. George's Hospital, London, England, SW17 0QT, United Kingdom|Maidstone Hospital, Maidstone, England, ME16 9QQ, United Kingdom|Sir James Spence Institute of Child Health at Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, NE1 4LP, United Kingdom|Mount Vernon Cancer Centre at Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, England, HA6 2RN, United Kingdom|Rosemere Cancer Centre at Royal Preston Hospital, Preston, England, PR2 9HT, United Kingdom|Alexandra Healthcare NHS, Redditch, England, B98 7UB, United Kingdom|Oldchurch Hospital, Romford, England, RM7 OBE, United Kingdom|Pembury Hospital, Royal Tunbridge Wells, England, TN2 4QJ, United Kingdom|Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, England, SO16 6YD, United Kingdom|Staffordshire General Hospital, Stafford, England, ST16 3SA, United Kingdom|Royal Marsden -
