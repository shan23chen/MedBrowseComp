NCT00003052,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Hyperthermia Therapy in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003052,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body temperature. It is not known whether receiving chemotherapy plus hyperthermia is more effective than receiving chemotherapy alone in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy alone to see how well it works compared to combination chemotherapy and hyperthermia therapy in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.",NO,Sarcoma,DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: ifosfamide|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|PROCEDURE: hyperthermia treatment|RADIATION: radiation therapy,Local progression-free survival,Response as assessed by WHO criteria|Overall survival|Relapse-free survival|Acute and late complications as assessed by CTC v 1.0,,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,The European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,340,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000065699|EORTC-62961,1997-07,,2010-06,2003-01-27,,2013-09-17,"Robert Roessle Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of Berlin - Charite Campus Buch, Berlin, D-13122, Germany|Universitaetsklinikum Essen, Essen, D-45122, Germany|Universitaetsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, D-20246, Germany|Klinikum der Universitaet Muenchen - Grosshadern Campus, Munich, D-81377, Germany",
