NCT00003138,Erythropoietin (EPO)+/- Filgrastim (G-CSF) vs. Supportive Therapy Alone for Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00003138,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim stimulate the production of blood cells. It is not yet known whether erythropoietin with or without filgrastim is more effective than standard blood transfusions in reducing the need for transfusions in patients who have anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndrome.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of erythropoietin with or without filgrastim with that of standard blood transfusions in reducing the need for transfusions in patients who have anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndrome.",YES,Anemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes,BIOLOGICAL: Erythropoietin|BIOLOGICAL: Filgrastim|PROCEDURE: Transfusion,"Proportion of Patients Free of Transfusion at 4 Months, Whether a patient required transfusion or not at 4 months was recorded., Assessed at 4 months","Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause. Patients alive at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last contact., Assessed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 subsequent years, and annually thereafter|Quality of Life- Total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) Score at 4 Months, The FACT-G scale has 4 dimensions, including physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. The score for each subscale was added together to obtain the total FACT-G score that was evaluated on this study. The total FACT-G score ranges from 0 to 108 with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. It was administered at the time of study entry, every 4 months for the first year, and at the time patient went off treatment. Due to limited data after 4 months on treatment, the analysis was restricted to the four-month time point., Assessed at 4 months",,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,National Cancer Institute (NCI),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,118,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000065907|E1996|U10CA021115,1998-03-04,2008-08,2014-05,2003-01-27,2013-12-06,2023-06-29,"CCOP - Colorado Cancer Research Program, Incorporated, Denver, Colorado, 80224, United States|Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Lakeside Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60611-4494, United States|Robert H.
