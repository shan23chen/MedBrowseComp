NCT00238238,Rituximab and/or Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma That is Not Refractory to Rituximab,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00238238,,COMPLETED,"Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Lenalidomide may also stop the growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving rituximab together with lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells. This randomized phase II trial is studying how well rituximab and/or lenalidomide work in treating patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is not refractory to rituximab.",YES,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|DRUG: lenalidomide,"Overall Response Rate, Response is assessed by investigator according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria. A complete response requires disappearance of all evidence of disease. A partial response is a \>/= 50% decrease in the sum of products of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses as well as for splenic and hepatic nodules. No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease., Duration of treatment (12 cycles)|Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from study entry until progression or death without progression. The median TTP with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 10 years",,,Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology,National Cancer Institute (NCI),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,97,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CALGB-50401|CALGB-50401|U10CA031946|CDR0000442872,2006-03,2012-06,2015-08,2005-10-13,2017-02-07,2017-03-15,"Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, 92093-0658, United States|Kaiser Permanente Medical Office -Vandever Medical Office, San Diego, California, 92120, United States|Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20307-5001, United States|Michael and Dianne Bienes Comprehensive Cancer Center at Holy Cross Hospital, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33308, United States|Ella Milbank Foshay Cancer Center at Jupiter Medical Center, Jupiter, Florida, 33458, United States|CCOP -
