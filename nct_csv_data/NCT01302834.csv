NCT01302834,Radiation Therapy With Cisplatin or Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Oropharyngeal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01302834,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with cisplatin or cetuximab in treating oropharyngeal cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying radiation therapy with cisplatin or cetuximab to see how well it works in treating patients with oropharyngeal cancer.",YES,Head and Neck Cancer|Precancerous Condition,BIOLOGICAL: cetuximab|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: IMRT,"Overall Survival, An event for overall survival is death due to any cause. Survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of death or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The protocol endpoint is hazard ratio, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Five-year rate is reported simply as summary data; it is not the outcome measure., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after 180 deaths were reported. Analysis occurred after 133 deaths were reported. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 6.5 years.","Progression-free Survival, An event for progression-free survival is local, regional, or distant disease progression or death due to any cause. Progression-free survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of progression/death or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The protocol endpoint is the distribution of progression-free survival times, for which the hazard ratio is reported in the statistical analysis results. Five-year rate is reported simply as summary data; it is not the outcome measure., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after 180 deaths were reported. Analysis occurred after 133 deaths were reported.

Local-regional failure time is defined as time from randomization to the date of progression/death or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the cumulative incidence method. The protocol endpoint is the distribution of local-regional failure times, for which the hazard ratio is reported in the statistical analysis results. Five-year rate is reported simply as summary data; it is not the outcome measure., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after 180 deaths were reported. Analysis occurred after 133 deaths were reported. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 6.5 years.|Time to Distant Metastasis, Failure for distant metastasis endpoint was defined as distant progression; local-regional failure and death due to any cause were considered competing risks. Distant metastasis time is defined as time from randomization to the date of progression/death or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the cumulative incidence method. The protocol endpoint is the distribution of distant metastasis times, for which the hazard ratio is reported in the statistical analysis results. Five-year rate is reported simply as summary data; it is not the outcome measure., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after 180 deaths were reported. Analysis occurred after 133 deaths were reported. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 6.5 years.|Time to Secondary Primary Cancer, Failure for second primary endpoint was defined as reporting of a new primary cancer; death due to any cause was considered a competing risk. Second primary time is defined as time from randomization to the date of second primary or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the cumulative incidence method. The protocol endpoint is the distribution of second primary cancer times, for which the hazard ratio is reported in the statistical analysis results. Five-year rate is reported simply as summary data; it is not the outcome measure., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after 180 deaths were reported.

The frequency table of these events is also referred to as ""Pattern of failure."", From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after 180 deaths were reported. Analysis occurred after 133 deaths were reported. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 6.5 years.|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Early Death, Early death is defined as death due to adverse event or within 30 days of treatment completion., From randomization to last follow-up.
