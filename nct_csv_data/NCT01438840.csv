NCT01438840,Efficacy and Safety of Oral E5501 Plus Standard of Care for the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Adults With Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (Amendment 02),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01438840,,COMPLETED,"Core Study:

To demonstrate that the efficacy of avatrombopag (in addition to standard of care) is superior to placebo (in addition to standard of care) for the treatment of adult participants with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) (ITP) as measured by cumulative number of weeks of platelet response over 6 months of once daily treatment in adults participants who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy.

Extension Phase:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with avatrombopag in participants with chronic ITP (cITP).",YES,Chronic Thrombocytopenia|Immune Thrombocytopenia,DRUG: Avatrombopag|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Standard of care,"Number of Weeks With Platelet Count Greater Than or Equal to 50 x 10^9/L During 6-Month Treatment Period, The cumulative number of weeks of platelet response is defined as the total numbers of weeks in which the platelet count is greater than or equal to 50 x 10\^ 9/L during 6 months of treatment of core study in the absence of rescue therapy., Week 1 to Week 26","Number of Participants With a Reduction in Use of Concomitant Immune/Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Medication, Only participants on concomitant ITP medications at baseline were included., Week 1 through Week 26|Number of Participants With Platelet Count Greater Than or Equal to 50 x 10^9/L at Day 8, Participants with platelet response at Day 8 are defined as those who had a platelet count greater than or equal to 50 x 10\^9/L at day 8 in the absence of rescue therapy on or before Day 8., Week 1 (Day 8)",,Eisai Inc.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,49,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",E5501-G000-302,2012-02-16,2013-11,2014-03,2011-09-22,2018-01-05,2018-02-05,"Adelaide, Australia|Bedford Park, Australia|Antwerpen, Belgium|Plovdiv, Bulgaria|Sofia, Bulgaria|Brno, Czechia|Hradec Kralove, Czechia|Praha, Czechia|Rotterdam, Netherlands|Christchurch, New Zealand|Palmerston North, New Zealand|Bialystok, Poland|Chorzow, Poland|Gdansk, Poland|Krakow, Poland|Lodz, Poland|Wroclaw, Poland|Singapore, Singapore|Bratislava, Slovakia|Johannesburg, South Africa|Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine|Donetsk, Ukraine|Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine|Kyiv, Ukraine|Lviv, Ukraine",
