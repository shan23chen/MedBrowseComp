NCT01721772,"Study of Nivolumab (BMS-936558) Compared With Dacarbazine in Untreated, Unresectable, or Metastatic Melanoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01721772,CheckMate 066,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical benefit, as measured by overall survival, of nivolumab with that of. dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated, unresectable, or metastatic melanoma",YES,Melanoma,BIOLOGICAL: BMS-936558 (Nivolumab)|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo matching BMS-936558 (Nivolumab)|DRUG: Dacarbazine|DRUG: Placebo matching Dacarbazine,"Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death or the last date the participant was known to be alive., From date of randomization to date of death. For those without documentation of death, to the last date the participant was known to be alive, assessed up to 17 months.|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS rate is calculated as the percentage of participants alive at the indicated timepoints, From randomization to 6 months and or to 12 months","Progression-free Survival (PFS), Investigator-assessed PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented progression, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who died without progressing were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Those who did not progress or die were documented on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Patients who did not have any on-study tumor assessments and did not die were documented on their date of randomization. Those who started any subsequent anticancer therapy without a prior reported progression were documented on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy., From date of randomization up to date of disease progression or death, up to approximately 84 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate, The PFS rate at a time point is the estimated percentage of patients who have not progressed and are alive at that time point following randomization and is estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology., From randomization to the specified timepoints, up to 84 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) defined complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). RECIST, volume 1.1 for target lesions: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimension (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; stable disease=neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started; PD=at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, and the sum LD must have an absolute increase of ≥5 mm., Tumor assessments beginning at 9 weeks following randomization and continuing every 6 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or death, assessed to 94 months|Overall Survival by Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression Level, Overall Survival is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death or the last date the participant was known to be alive. PD-L1 expression level is defined as the percent of tumor cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1-staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells per a Dako PD-L1 IHC (immunohistochemistry) assay (referred to as quantifiable PD-L1 expression). Assessment of OS by PD-L1 expression as measured by a validated assay and comparing OS in patients with tumor PD-L1 expression ≥5% (PD-L1 positive) versus patients with tumor PD-L1 expression \<5% (PD-L1 negative). Tumor tissue samples for PD-L1 testing were collected at screening from metastatic or unresectable sites prior to randomization., From date of randomization to date of disease progression or death, up to approximately 94 months|Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Scores, HRQoL is evaluated by mean changes from baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) global health status/quality of life composite scale in all randomized patients. The QLQ-30 is a cancer-specific, self-administered questionnaire that contains 30 questions, covering global, functional, and symptom scales. Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores on global and functional scales indicate better quality of life (QoL), while higher scores on the symptom scales indicate declining QoL., At baseline and every 6 weeks for 12 months and at follow-up visits 1 and 2, assessed up to 93 months",,Bristol-Myers Squibb,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,418,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CA209-066|2012-003718-16,2013-01-18,2014-06-24,2021-05-14,2012-11-06,2016-02-25,2022-07-12,"Fundacion Cidea, Buenos Aires, Distrito Federal, 1121, Argentina|Instituto Medico Especialazado Alexander Fleming, Buenos Aires, C1426ANZ, Argentina|Instituto Oncologico De Cordoba, Cordoba, 5000, Argentina|Local Institution, Camperdown, New South Wales, 2050, Australia|Coffs Harbour Health Campus, Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, 2450, Australia|Local Institution - 0006, North Sydney, New South Wales, 2060, Australia|Local Institution, Westmead, New South Wales, 2145, Australia|Greenslopes Private Hospital, Greenslopes, Queensland, 4120, Australia|Local Institution, Southport, Queensland, 4215, Australia|Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, 4102, Australia|Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, 5000, Australia|Cabrini Hospital, Malvern, Victoria, 3144, Australia|Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N2, Canada|Local Institution - 0039, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 4E6, Canada|Qe Ii Health Science Centre, Halfax, Nova Scotia, B3H 2Y9, Canada|Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Local Institution - 0040, Montreal, Quebec, H4A 3J1, Canada|Local Institution, Santiago, Metropolitana, Chile|Local Institution, Viña Del Mar, Valparaiso, Chile|Local Institution, Santiago, 7630370, Chile|Aarhus Universitetshospital, Aarhus, 8000, Denmark|Herlev Hospital, Herlev, 2730, Denmark|Odense University Hospital, Odense, 5000, Denmark|Local Institution - 0035, Helsinki, 00290, Finland|Hopital Saint Andre, Bordeaux, 33075, France|Chu Grenoble - Hopital Albert Michallon, Grenoble, 38043, France|Chru De Lille - Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille, 59037, France|Hopital St Eloi, Montpellier, 34295, France|Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, 75010, France|Local Institution - 0013, Villejuif, 94805, France|Local Institution, Wuerzburg, Bayern, 97080, Germany|Local Institution, Essen, 45122, Germany|Local Institution, Gera, 07548, Germany|Local Institution, Goettingen, 37075, Germany|Local Institution, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany|Local Institution, Kiel, 24105, Germany|Local Institution, Koeln, 50937, Germany|Local Institution, Magdeburg, 39120, Germany|Local Institution, Mainz, 55131, Germany|Local Institution, Nuernberg, 90419, Germany|Local Institution, Recklinghausen, 45659, Germany|Local Institution, Tubingen, 72076, Germany|Laiko Hospital, Athens, 11527, Greece|Metropolitan Hospital, Neo Faliro, 18547, Greece|Local Institution, Haifa, 34362, Israel|Local Institution, Jerusalem, 91120, Israel|Local Institution, Tel Hashomer, 52621, Israel|Local Institution, Bari, 70124, Italy|Local Institution, Bergamo, 24127, Italy|Local Institution, Genova, 16132, Italy|Local Institution, Meldola (fc), 47014, Italy|Local Institution, Milano, 20133, Italy|Local Institution, Milano, 20141, Italy|Local Institution, Napoli, 80131, Italy|Local Institution, Padova, 35128, Italy|Local Institution, Roma, 00144, Italy|Local Institution, Siena, 53100, Italy|Local Institution, Mexico, Distrito Federal, 03310, Mexico|Local Institution, Tlalpan, Distrito Federal, 14080, Mexico|Local Institution, Leon, Guanajato, Guanajuato, 37000, Mexico|Local Institution, Morelia, Michoacan, 58240, Mexico|Local Institution, Oslo, 0379, Norway|Local Institution, Gdansk, 80-219, Poland|Local Institution, Lodz, 93-513, Poland|Local Institution, Warszawa, 02-781, Poland|Local Institution, San Sebastian, Guipuzcoa, 20014, Spain|Local Institution - 0056, Barcelona, 08036, Spain|Local Institution, Madrid, 28033, Spain|Local Institution, Madrid, 28034, Spain|Local Institution, Sevilla, 41009, Spain|Local Institution, Valencia, 46014, Spain|Local Institution, Gothenberg, 413 45, Sweden|Local Institution, Lund, 221 85, Sweden|Local Institution, Umea, 901 85, Sweden",
