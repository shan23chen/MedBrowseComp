The primary endpoint of PFS was based on Investigator assessment., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 18 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression|Percentage of Participants in Progression Free Survival at 6, 12, and 18 Months, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression and was used to assess the efficacy of single agent osimertinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy as measured by PFS., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 18 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression","Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the number (%) of participants with measurable disease with at least 1 visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) and it was used to further assess the efficacy of osimertinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy. ORR was based on Investigator assessment., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 18 months and then every 12 weeks relative to randomisation until progression|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression and was used to further assess the efficacy of osimertinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 18 months and then every 12 weeks until objective disease progression|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a best overall response (BOR) of Complete response (CR), Partial response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) â‰¥6 weeks prior to any Progressive disease (PD) event and was used to further assess the efficacy of osimertinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy., At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 18 months and then every 12 weeks until objective disease progression|Depth of Response, The Depth of response was defined as the relative change in the sum of the longest diameters of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Target lesions (TLs) at the nadir, in the absence of new lesions (NLs) or progression of Non-target lesions (NTLs), compared to baseline and was used to further assess the efficacy of osimertinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy, At baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 18 months and then every 12 weeks until objective disease progression|Overall Survival (OS)- Number of Participants With an Event, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death from any cause and was used to further assess the efficacy of osimertinib compared with SoC EGFR-TKI therapy, From first dose to end of study or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed every 6 weeks (approximately 29 months)|Plasma Concentrations of AZD9291, To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of osimertinib, Blood samples collected from each participant at pre-dose, 0.5 to 2 hours, and 3 to 5 hours post-dose on Day 1 Cycle 1, and every other cycle thereafter up to and including Cycle 13 (approximately 9 months)|Plasma Concentrations of Metabolites AZ5104, To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of osimertinib metabolite AZ5104., Blood samples collected from each participant at pre-dose, 0.5 to 2 hours, and 3 to 5 hours post-dose on Day 1 Cycle 1, and every other cycle thereafter up to and including Cycle 13 (approximately 9 months)|Plasma Concentrations of Metabolite AZ7550, To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of osimertinib metabolite AZ7550., Blood samples collected from each participant at pre-dose, 0.5 to 2 hours, and 3 to 5 hours post-dose on Day 1 Cycle 1, and every other cycle thereafter up to and including Cycle 13 (approximately 9 months)|Participants Reported Outcome by Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire 16 Items (CTSQ-16 Questionnaire), The CTSQ-16 was a 16-item questionnaire measuring 3 domains related to participant's satisfaction with cancer therapy: Expectations of therapy, Feelings about side effects, and Satisfaction with therapy. Scores ranged from 0 to 100 for each domain, with a higher score associated with the best outcome on each domain. The three domains of interest were separately analysed using an ANCOVA stratified by race (Asian versus Non-Asian) and mutation type (Ex19del versus L858R). The results of the analyses were presented in terms of mean together with standard deviation., Questionnaire completed in cycle 2 and 3, prior to Week 6 scan (approximately 2 months)|Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QLQ) Questionnaires Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13), The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was a lung-cancer-specific module comprising 13 questions to assess lung cancer symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and site-specific pain); treatment related side-effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia); and pain medication. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items. Higher scores on the global health status/QoL and functioning scales indicated better health status/QoL and function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden. The analysis was performed using a Mixed-effects model for repeated measures analysis on the change from baseline in PRO symptom score at each visit up to 9 months (281 days), including participants, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as explanatory variables, the baseline PRO score as a covariate along with the baseline PRO score by visit interaction, using an unstructured covariance structure., Questionnaires completed at baseline, first 9 months, and at week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36|Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 Items (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 cancer-specific questionnaire consisted of 30 questions, combined to produce 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, 6 individual items, and a global measure of health status/QoL. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items, the functional scales, and the global health status/QoL scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30. Higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicated better health status/function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden. The analysis was performed using a Mixed-effects model for repeated measures analysis on the change from baseline in PRO symptom score at each visit up to 9 months (281 days), including participants, treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as explanatory variables, the baseline PRO score as a covariate along with the baseline PRO score by visit interaction, using an unstructured covariance structure., Questionnaires completed at baseline, first 9 months, and at week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36.",,AstraZeneca,Parexel,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,674,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",D5160C00007|U1111-1160-2242|2014-002694-11,2014-12-03,2017-06-19,2025-12-31,2014-11-20,2018-11-06,2025-03-25,"Research Site, Anaheim, California, 92801, United States|Research Site, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|Research Site, West Hills, California, 91307, United States|Research Site, Tampa, Florida, 33612, United States|Research Site, Atlanta, Georgia, 30318, United States|Research Site, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Research Site, Marietta, Georgia, 30060, United States|Research Site, Louisville, Kentucky, 40202, United States|Research Site, Bethesda, Maryland, 20817, United States|Research Site, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Research Site, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55407, United States|Research Site, Lebanon, New Hampshire, 03756, United States|Research Site, Salisbury, North Carolina, 28144, United States|Research Site, Burlington, Vermont, 05401, United States|Research Site, Camperdown, 2050, Australia|Research Site, Chermside, 4032, Australia|Research Site, Clayton, 3168, Australia|Research Site, Heidelberg, 3084, Australia|Research Site, Kogarah, 2217, Australia|Research Site, Nedlands, 6009, Australia|Research Site, Woolloongabba, 4102, Australia|Research Site, Leuven, 3000, Belgium|Research Site, LiÃ¨ge, 4000, Belgium|Research Site, Roeselare, 8800, Belgium|Research Site, Porto Alegre, 90610-000, Brazil|Research Site, Sofia, 1330, Bulgaria|Research Site, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|Research Site, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 5C2, Canada|Research Site, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada|Research Site, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5, Canada|Research Site, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X5, Canada|Research Site, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|Research Site, Beijing, 100071, China|Research Site, Beijing, 100853, China|Research Site, Changchun, 130012, China|Research Site, Changchun, 130021, China|Research Site, Chongqing, 400037, China|Research Site, Chongqing, 400038, China|Research Site, Chongqing, 400042, China|Research Site, Fuzhou, 350025, China|Research Site, Guangzhou, 510080, China|Research Site, Hangzhou, 310022, China|Research Site, Nanjing, 210029, China|Research Site, Nanning, 530021, China|Research Site, Shanghai, 200433, China|Research Site, Shenyang, 110001, China|Research Site, Suzhou, 215006, China|Research Site, Wuhan, 430071, China|Research Site, Xi'an, 710038, China|Research Site, Xi'an, 710061, China|Research Site, Yangzhou, 225001, China|Research Site, ÃœrÃ¼mqi, 830000, China|Research Site, Ostrava, 708 52, Czechia|Research Site, Caen, F-14033, France|Research Site, Creteil, 94010, France|Research Site, Lyon Cedex 08, 69373, France|Research Site, Nantes, 44202, France|Research Site, Toulon Naval, 83800, France|Research Site, Villejuif, 94805, France|Research Site, Bad Berka, 99437, Germany|Research Site, Berlin, 13125, Germany|Research Site, Gauting, 82131, Germany|Research Site, Halle, 06120, Germany|Research Site, Heidelberg, 69126, Germany|Research Site, Karlsruhe, 76137, Germany|Research Site, LÃ¼beck, 23538, Germany|Research Site, MÃ¼nchen, 81925, Germany|Research Site, Villingen-Schwenningen, 78052, Germany|Research Site, FarkasgyepÃ¼, 8582, Hungary|Research Site, GyÃ¶ngyÃ¶s -
