NCT00209209,Induction Chemotherapy (R-CHOP Vs. R-FC) Followed by Interferon Maintenance Versus Rituximab Maintenance in MCL,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00209209,MCLelderly,UNKNOWN,"The aim of this study is to answer the following independent questions in the treatment of mantle cell lymphomas:

* Can rituximab-fludarabine, cyclophosphamide (R-FC) improve the reduction of lymphoma mass compared to rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP) and so become a new standard for initial cytoreductive therapy?
* Can maintenance with rituximab substitute the interferon maintenance and even improve the progression free survival in patients after successful initial cytoreductive therapy?",NO,"Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell",DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Interferon-alpha|DRUG: pegylated formula Interferon-alpha 2b|PROCEDURE: chemotherapy: R-CHOP|PROCEDURE: chemotherapy: R-FC|PROCEDURE: Interferon maintenance|PROCEDURE: Rituximab maintenance,First randomisation: Reduction of lymphoma mass measured by the complete remission (CR) rate|Second randomisation: progression-free survival after end of initial chemotherapy,Survival after registration / first randomisation / second randomisation|Survival after start / end of initial therapy|Time to treatment failure after start of initial therapy|Progression free survival after registration / first randomisation / second randomisation|Side-effects of initial therapy|Side-effects of maintenance therapy,,European Mantle Cell Lymphoma Network,German Low Grade Lymphoma Study Group|Lymphoma Study Association|HOVON - Dutch Haemato-Oncology Association|Nordic Lymphoma Group,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,570,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,MCL2004-1,2004-01-14,2018-12,2018-12,2005-09-21,,2017-03-07,"General University Hospital, 1St Department of Medicine, Praha, CZ-12808, Czech Republic|Nordic Lymphoma Group, Copenhagen, DK-2100, Denmark|Groupe D´Etudes des Lymphomes De l´Adulte (GELA), Paris, F-75743, France|German Low Grade Study Group (Glsg), Munich, D-81377, Germany|Ospedale Ferratotto, Divisione Di Ematologia, Catania, I-95124, Italy|HOVON - Dutch Haemato-Oncology Association (HOVON-Datacenter), Rotterdam, NL-3008 AE, Netherlands|The Maria Sklodowska Memorial, Cancer Center - Inst. of Oncology, Warszawa, PL-02-781, Poland",
