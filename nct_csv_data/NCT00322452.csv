NCT00322452,First Line IRESSA™ Versus Carboplatin/Paclitaxel in Asia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00322452,IPASS,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to compare gefitinib with carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy given as first line treatment in terms of progression free survival in selected NSCLC patients with the objective of demonstrating non-inferiority.,YES,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Months, PFS was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of objective disease progression (as per RECIST) or the date of death (from any cause) in the absence of objective disease progression. The median PFS in months is presented here., Tumour assessments as per RECIST were performed at baseline and then every 42 days ± 7 days from randomization until data cut off (14th April 2008).","Median Overall Survival (OS) in Months at OS Data Cut Off (14th June 2010), Overall Survival was assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant was known to have died, the time to death was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant was censored at the last date they were known to be alive. Median Overall Survival in months is presented here., Following the PFS DCO on 14th April 2008 information on survival status was collected every 8 weeks.|Objective Tumour Response Rate According to RECIST, Number of participants with an objective response. An objective response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response., Tumour assessments as per RECIST were performed at baseline and then every 42 days ± 7 days from randomization until data cut off (14th April 2008).|Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3, 4, or 5 Neutropenia, Number of patients with a neutropenia event, identified from the lab data as a worsening in absolute neutrophil count from baseline to a CTC grade 3 or above which Based on the evaluable-for-safety population, which included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication (gefitinib, or carboplatin or paclitaxel)., Includes events that occurred whilst a patient was receiving first-line randomized treatment: defined as date of first dose to date of last dose +1 day for gefitinib, and date of first infusion to date of last infusion + 21 days for carboplatin/paclitaxel|Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3, 4, or 5 Thrombocytopenia, Number of patients with a thromboctyopenia event, identified from the lab data as a worsening in platelet count from baseline to a CTC grade 3 or above.
