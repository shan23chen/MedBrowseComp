NCT00411138,Randomized Trial of Radiation Therapy With or Without Chemotherapy for Endometrial Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00411138,PORTEC-3,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy is more effective than giving radiation therapy alone in treating endometrial cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemotherapy and radiation therapy to see how well they work compared with radiation therapy alone in treating patients with high-risk, stage I, stage II, or stage III endometrial cancer.",NO,Endometrial Cancer,RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Overall survival, co-primary endpoint, 5 years|Failure-free survival, co-primary endpoint, 5 years","Quality of life by QLQ-C30 v3.0, Health-related overall quality of life and patient-reported symptom measures, 5 years|Severe treatment-related morbidity, Acute serious events and SAE and late grade 3-4 complications, 5 years|Vaginal or pelvic relapse, Both vaginal or pelvic relapse as first failure and total vaginal or pelvic relapse, 5 years|Distant metastases, Both distant relapse as first failure and total distant relapse, 5 years",,Leiden University,Cancer Research UK|Australia New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group|NCIC Clinical Trials Group|Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research|UNICANCER,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,670,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CDR0000521447; P06.031|CKTO-2006-04|ISRCTN14387080|P06.031-PORTEC-3|2007-004917-33,2006-11-23,2018-11-29,2024-12-31,2006-12-13,,2023-10-11,"Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, 2300 RC, Netherlands",
