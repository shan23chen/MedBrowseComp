NCT02371369,Phase 3 Study of Pexidartinib for Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS) or Giant Cell Tumor of the Tendon Sheath (GCT-TS),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02371369,ENLIVEN,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase 3 clinical study, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational drug called pexidartinib for the treatment of certain tumors for which surgical removal could cause more harm than good.

The main purpose of this study is to gather information about the investigational drug pexidartinib, which may help to treat tumors of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) or giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS).

The study consists of two parts with a follow-up period. In Part 1, eligible study participants will be assigned to receive either pexidartinib or matching placebo for 24 weeks. A number of assessments will be carried out during the course of the study, including physical examinations, blood tests, imaging studies, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires. MRI scans will be used to evaluate the response of the tumors to the treatment. Some subjects, assigned to placebo in Part 1 transitioned to pexidartinib for Part 2.

Then a protocol amendment was written to allow only pexidartinib patients to continue into Part 2. Part 2 is a long-term treatment phase in which all participants receive open-label pexidartinib. There was also a follow-up period added to Part 2.",YES,Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis|Giant Cell Tumors of the Tendon Sheath|Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor,DRUG: Pexidartinib|DRUG: Placebo,"Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic, Locally Advanced Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT) Achieving Complete or Partial Response to Pexidartinib Compared With That of Placebo Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 at Week 25, Complete response (CR) and partial responses (PR) were assessed based on centrally-read magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). A CR was defined as disappearance of all tumors and a PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target tumors using the baseline sum diameters as the reference., Week 25","Mean Change From Baseline For Range of Motion (ROM) Score in Participants Receiving Pexidartinib Compared With Those on Placebo Up to Week 25, Range of motion (ROM) of the joint was assessed by a qualified, independent, and blinded or third-party assessors at the clinical site. Measurements were recorded in degrees. At baseline, the plane of movement with the smallest relative value (worst) was identified and this plane was used for evaluating the relative change of motion subsequently. Only the plane with the worst impaired ROM at baseline was selected for subsequent analyses., Baseline, Week 13, and Week 25|Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic, Locally Advanced Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT) Achieving Complete or Partial Response Based on Tumor Volume Score (TVS) After Receiving Pexidartinib Compared With Those on Placebo at Week 25, Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were assessed using tumor volume score (TVS). A CR was defined as disappearance of all tumors and a PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target tumors using the baseline sum diameters as the reference. TVS is a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system that describes tumor mass and is based on 10% increments of the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath involved. A tumor that is equal in volume to that of a maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath was scored 10; a score of 0 indicated no evidence of tumor., Week 25|Mean Change From Baseline in the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Score in Participants Receiving Pexidartinib Compared With Those on Placebo Up to Week 25, The Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function scale was used to assess physical function of the upper and lower limbs. The scale ranged from 1 defined as 'unable to do' or 'cannot do' to 5 defined as 'without any difficulty' or 'not at all', where higher scores represent better outcomes., at Week 9 , Week 17, and Week 25|Mean Change From Baseline for Worst Stiffness Numeric Rating Scale Score (NRS) in Participants Receiving Pexidartinib Compared With Those on Placebo Up to Week 25, The Worst Stiffness Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was a 1-item, self-administered questionnaire assessing the ""worst"" stiffness in the last 24 hours.
