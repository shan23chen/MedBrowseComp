NCT00486668,A Study of AC Followed by a Combination of Paclitaxel Plus Trastuzumab or Lapatinib or Both Given Before Surgery to Patients With Operable HER2 Positive Invasive Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00486668,,UNKNOWN,"The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether breast cancer tumors respond (as measured by pathologic complete response: the absence of microscopic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the breast) to combined chemotherapy of AC(doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab or lapatinib or both given before surgery to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab will also be given to all patients after surgery. The study will also evaluate the toxic effects of the chemotherapy combination, including effects on the heart, and will determine survival and progression-free survival 5 years after treatment. Also, the study will look at whether there are gene expression profiles in the tumor tissue that can predict pathologic complete response.",NO,Invasive Breast Cancer,DRUG: doxorubicin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: trastuzumab|DRUG: lapatinib,"Determination of pathologic complete response (pCR), defined by the absence of microscopic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the post chemotherapy surgical breast specimen., surgery following chemotherapy","The determination of pCR in the surgical breast and lymph node specimens following chemotherapy., surgery following chemotherapy|Clinical tumor measurement as assessed by physical exam of the breast and lymph nodes, baseline (prior to starting protocol therapy), at the completion of AC (before starting paclitaxel and trastuzumab and/or lapatinib), and at the conclusion of the sequential regimens (prior to surgery).|Determination of cardiac toxicity as measured by the incidence of cardiac events defined as definite or probable cardiac death, two year cumulative incidence|Determination of non-cardiac toxicities as measured by frequencies of adverse events categorized using CTCAE v3.0., through 5 years after entry|Overall survival as measured by time from randomization until death from any cause., through 5 years after entry|Recurrence-free interval as measured by occurrence of inoperable progressive disease, or from time of surgery to occurrence of local, regional, or distant recurrence in patients with operable disease., through 5 years after entry|In tumor tissue, a comparison of array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data with gene expression profile data to examine coordinated overexpression of amplified genes, especially in HER2 and cMYC loci., Tissue sample collected at surgery following chemotherapy",,NSABP Foundation Inc,GlaxoSmithKline,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,529,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,NSABP B-41,2007-07,2012-06,2017-03,2007-06-15,,2016-06-06,"MBCCOP, Gulf Coast, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Scripps Cancer Center-San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|University of California, Irvine Medical Center, Long Beach, California, 90801, United States|Pacific Shores Medical Group, Long Beach, California, 90813, United States|St. Joseph Hospital, Orange, California, 92868, United States|Desert Regional Medical Center Comprehensive Cancer Center, Palm Springs, California, 92262, United States|Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Sutter Medical Center, Sacramento, California, 95816, United States|Kaiser Permanente-San Diego, San Diego, California, 92120, United States|Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Santa Rosa, California, 95403, United States|Kaiser Permanente-Vallejo, Vallejo, California, 94589, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Memorial Hospital, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 80909, United States|Kaiser Permanente-Franklin, Denver, Colorado, 80205, United States|CCOP-Colorado Cancer Research Prog.
