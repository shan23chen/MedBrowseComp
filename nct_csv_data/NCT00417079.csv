NCT00417079,XRP6258 Plus Prednisone Compared to Mitoxantrone Plus Prednisone in Hormone Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00417079,TROPIC,COMPLETED,"This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center study comparing the safety and efficacy of XRP6258 plus prednisone to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in the treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a Taxotere®-containing regimen. The primary objective is overall survival. Secondary objectives include progression free survival, overall response rate, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response/progression, pain response/progression, overall safety, and pharmacokinetics. Patients will be treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 10 cycles. Patients will have long-term follow-up for a maximum of up to 2 years.",YES,Neoplasms|Prostatic Neoplasms,DRUG: cabazitaxel (XRP6258) (RPR116258)|DRUG: mitoxantrone|DRUG: prednisone,"Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.

In the absence of confirmation of death, the survival time was censored at the last date patient was known to be alive or at the cut-off date, whichever had come first., From the date of randomization up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)","Time to Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival was defined as a composite endpoint evaluated from the date of randomization to the date of tumor progression, PSA progression, pain progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, From the date of randomization up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)|Overall Tumor Response, Tumor Overall Response Rate (ORR) (only in patients with measurable disease):

Objective responses (Complete Response and Partial Response) for measurable disease as assessed by investigators according to RECIST criteria.

Complete Response (CR) is defined as: Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) is defined as: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum LD.

Confirmation of objective responses will be performed by repeat tumor imaging (CT scans, MRI, bone scans) after the first documentation of response., From the date of randomization up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)|Time to Tumor Progression, Time to tumor progression is defined as the number of months from randomization until evidence of progressive disease (RECIST), From the date of randomization up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)|Time to Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, In PSA non-responders, progression will be defined as a 25% increase over nadir and increase in the absolute value PSA level by at least 5 ng/ml and confirmed by a second value at least 4 weeks later.

In PSA responders and in patients not evaluable for PSA response at baseline, progression will be defined as a ≥50% increase over nadir, provided that the increase is a minimum of 5 ng/ml and confirmed by a second value at least 1 week later., at screening, day 1 of every treatment cycle, up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)|PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) Response, PSA response was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in serum PSA, determined only for patients with a serum PSA ≥ 20ng/mL at baseline, confirmed by a repeat PSA ≥ 3 weeks later., from baseline up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)|Time to Pain Progression, Pain Progression is defined as an increase of ≥1 point in the median Personal Pain Intensity (PPI) from its nadir noted on 2 consecutive 3-week-apart visits or ≥25 % increase in the mean analgesic score compared with the baseline score \& noted on 2 consecutive 3-week-apart visits or requirement for local palliative radiotherapy.

Evaluation of the PPI \& analgesic scores are based on the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire which consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as 0=none (best) 1=mild 2=moderate 3=severe (worst) (TOTAL: 0=best 45=worst), from baseline up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)|Pain Response, Pain Response was defined as a two-point or greater reduction from baseline median Present Pain Intensity (PPI) score without an increased Analgesic Score (AS) or a decrease of ≥50% in the AS without an increase in the PPI score, maintained for at least 3 weeks., from baseline up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)",,Sanofi,,MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,755,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EFC6193,2007-01,2009-09,2009-09,2006-12-29,2010-12-23,2011-03-10,"sanofi-aventis US, Bridgewater, New Jersey, 08807, United States|sanofi-aventis Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina|sanofi-aventis Belgium, Diegem, Belgium|sanofi-aventis Brazil, Sao Paulo, Brazil|sanofi-aventis Canada, Laval, Quebec, Canada|sanofi-aventis Chile, Santiago, Chile|sanofi-aventis Czech Republic, Praha, Czech Republic|sanofi-aventis Denmark, Horsholm, Denmark|sanofi-aventis Finland, Helsinki, Finland|sanofi-aventis France, Paris, France|sanofi-aventis Germany, Berlin, Germany|Sanofi-Aventis Hungaria, Budapest, Hungary|sanofi-aventis India, Mumbai, India|sanofi-aventis Italy, Milano, Italy|sanofi-aventis South Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of|sanofi-aventis Mexico, Mexico, Mexico|sanofi-aventis Netherlands, Gouda, Netherlands|sanofi-aventis Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation|sanofi-aventis Singapore, Singapore, Singapore|sanofi-aventis Slovakia, Bratislava, Slovakia|sanofi-aventis South Africa, Midrand, South Africa|sanofi-aventis Spain, Barcelona, Spain|sanofi-aventis Sweden, Bromma, Sweden|sanofi-aventis Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan|sanofi-aventis Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey|sanofi-aventis UK, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom",
