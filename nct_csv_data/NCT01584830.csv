NCT01584830,Asian Subjects With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treated With Regorafenib or Placebo After Failure of Standard Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01584830,CONCUR,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to assess if Regorafenib in combination with best supportive care will slow down tumor progression and result in increased survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.,NO,Colorectal Neoplasms,DRUG: Regorafenib (BAY73-4506)|DRUG: Placebo,"Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From randomization of the first subject untill 154 death events observed, up to 2 years","Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to disease progression radiological/clinical or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From randomization of the first subject untill 154 death events observed, up to 2 years|The percentage of subjects with total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR)., From randomization of the first subject untill 154 death events observed, up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was not Progressive Disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (= total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR) + total number of Stable Disease (SD); CR, PR, or SD had to be maintained for at least 28 days from the first demonstration of that rating), From randomization of the first subject untill 154 death events observed, up to 2 years|Safety variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics based on adverse events collection, From randomization of the first subject untill 154 death events observed, up to 2 years",,Bayer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,204,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",15808,2012-04,2013-11,2016-01,2012-04-25,,2016-02-08,"Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, China|Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China|Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150056, China|Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210002, China|Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710032, China|Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, China|Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China|Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310016, China|Beijing, 100021, China|Beijing, 100071, China|Beijing, 100142, China|Changchun, 130021, China|Shanghai, 200030, China|Shanghai, 200032, China|Shanghai, 200080, China|Tianjin, 300060, China|Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong|Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Seoul, Korea, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|Taipei, 10016, Taiwan|Taipei, 11217, Taiwan|Taoyuan, 333, Taiwan|Hanoi, Vietnam|Hcmc, Vietnam|Ho Chi Minh City, 84, Vietnam",
