NCT01038661,Tax First-line Chemotherapy With Different Doses and Then Maintenance Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01038661,TFINE,COMPLETED,"The Primary Objective is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS).

The secondary objectives are:

* To compare the disease control rates of different doses of Docetaxel+Cisplatin as first-line treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria;
* To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR);
* To evaluate the time to disease progression (TTP);
* To evaluate the overall survival (OS);
