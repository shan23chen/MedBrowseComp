NCT00078949,Chemotherapy Before Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation +/- Rituximab in Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00078949,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving rituximab as maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation may kill any remaining cancer cells. It is not yet known which salvage chemotherapy regimen is more effective before autologous stem cell transplantation in treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying salvage chemotherapy using dexamethasone, cisplatin, and gemcitabine to see how well it works compared to dexamethasone, cisplatin, and cytarabine given before autologous stem cell transplantation in treating patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This trial also is studying giving rituximab as maintenance therapy to see how well it works compared to no further therapy after stem cell transplantation. Rituximab was added to both salvage treatment arms for CD20+ patients in a protocol amendment in 2005.",YES,Lymphoma,BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride,"Response Rate of Patients After 2 Courses of Chemotherapy, The overall response rate by arm is calculated as total number of responders (CR + CRu + PR) / (all patients in the ITT analysis population)., After 2 cycle of treatment|Transplantation Rate of Patients After 2 Courses of Chemotherapy, Transplantation rate is defined as the number of patients who respond sufficiently to protocol salvage chemotherapy to be planned for transplantation minus those who do not meet the endpoint of successful transplantation, divided by the number of all randomized patients, During period 1 (salvage chemotherapy)|Event-free Survival of Patients on Maintenance Randomization (Period 2), Number of patients who develop EFS event during maintenance randomization (period 2), during the period 2 (up to10 years)","Toxic Effect, Number of patients affected by adverse events graded according to CTC Version 2.0.
