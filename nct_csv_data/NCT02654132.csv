NCT02654132,An Investigational Immuno-therapy Trial of Pomalidomide and Low-dose Dexamethasone With or Without Elotuzumab to Treat Refractory and Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma (ELOQUENT-3),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02654132,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to determine if adding Elotuzumab to Pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone is a more effective treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma compared to pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone by itself.,YES,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Elotuzumab|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause. Progressive disease response criteria were defined as an increase of 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following:

1. Serum M-component and/or 2. Urine M-component and/or 3. Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels 4. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcemia that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder, From randomization to date of progression or death (up to approximately 21 months)","Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response (BOR) of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) or partial response (PR) using the modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria described as follows, as per investigator's assessment

* CR: Negative immunofixation of serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow
* sCR: CR, as defined above, plus the following: Normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence
* VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or \>= 90% reduction in serum M-protein level plus urine M-protein level \< 100 mg per 24 hour
* PR: \>= 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>= 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 hour., From first dose to disease progression (up to approximately 21 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. The survival time for participants who had not died was censored at the last known alive date. OS was censored at the date of randomization for subjects who were randomized but had no follow-up., From randomization to death (up to approximately 52 months)",,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Celgene|AbbVie,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,117,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CA204-125|2014-003282-19,2016-03-18,2018-01-17,2021-10-21,2016-01-13,2019-06-03,2022-11-01,"Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States|Investigative Clinical Research Of Indiana, Llc, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46260, United States|Beth Israel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute., Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Rochester General Hospital, Rochester, New York, 14621, United States|Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28204, United States|Va Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15240, United States|St Francis Hospital, Greenville, South Carolina, 29607, United States|Tennessee Cancer Specialists, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909, United States|Northern Utah Associates, Ogden, Utah, 84403, United States|University Of Washington, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|Local Institution, South Brisbane, Queensland, 4101, Australia|Local Institution, London, Ontario, N6A 4G5, Canada|CISSS de l'Outaouais, Gatineau, Quebec, J8P 7H2, Canada|Local Institution - 0048, Montreal, Quebec, H1T 2M4, Canada|Local Institution - 0022, Nantes Cedex 1, 44000, France|Local Institution - 0021, Paris Cedex 12, 75571, France|Local Institution - 0020, Pessac, 33604, France|Local Institution - 0019, Poitiers Cedex, 86021, France|Local Institution, Saint Pierre Cedex, 97448, France|Universitaetsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, 01307, Germany|Universitaetsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, 79106, Germany|St. Barbara-Klinik, Hamm, 59075, Germany|Local Institution - 0041, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany|Local Institution - 0056, Kiel, 24105, Germany|Klinikum Der Johannes Gutenberg Universitaet Mainz, Mainz, 55101, Germany|Universitaetsklinikum Tuebingen, Tuebingen, 72076, Germany|Laiko University Hospital, Athens, 11527, Greece|Alexandra General Hospital Of Athens, Athens, 11528, Greece|Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti Di Ancona, Ancona, 60126, Italy|A.
