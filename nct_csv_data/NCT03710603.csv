NCT03710603,"Daratumumab, VELCADE (Bortezomib), Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone Compared to VELCADE, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Subjects With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03710603,Perseus,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background of the study: The combination of daratumumab with VRd is anticipated to further improve response rates in patients and may lead to improved long-term outcomes in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. Given this potential, and based upon the initial safety and efficacy observed in the ongoing Phase 2 Study MMY2004, as well as continued positive results with daratumumab in various disease settings and combination regimens, this Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate improved outcomes for patients treated with daratumumab+VRd. The Phase 3 study will utilize the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of daratumumab instead of the IV formulation utilized in the Phase 2 study, which may limit additional toxicity to patients treated with the quadruplet regimen.",YES,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Velcade|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: dexamethasone,"Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as duration from date of randomization to either progressive disease (PD)/death whichever occurred first. PD was defined as meeting any one of the following criteria: Increase of \>= 25 % in level of serum M-protein form lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>= 0.5 g/dL; Increase of \>=25% in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion (urine M-protein) from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \>=200 mg/24 hours; Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels; increase of \>=25% in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels from lowest response value and absolute increase must be \> 10 mg/dL; Definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to PC proliferative disorder., From the date of randomization to either progressive disease or death whichever occurred first, up to a maximum follow-up time of 54.41 months.","Overall MRD Negativity Rate, Overall MRD-negativity rate was defined as the percentage of participants in the ITT population who achieved both MRD-negativity by NGS (at or below a sensitivity threshold of 10-5) in bone marrow aspirate and a CR or better response at any time after the date of randomization (and prior to disease progression, receipt of subsequent therapy, or both)., From randomization to the clinical cutoff date. Maximum follow up was 54.41 months.|Percentage of Participants With Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR- percentage of participants who achieved partial response (PR) or better (PR, Very Good Partial Response \[VGPR\], CR or sCR) based on computerized algorithm as per IMWG 2011 criteria. PR -greater than or equal to (\>=) 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200 mg//24 hours. If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required. A \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required; VGPR-serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or \>= 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein \<100 mg/24 hours; CR-negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \<5% PCs in bone marrow. sCR- in addition to CR a normal FLC ratio, and absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence or 2 to 4-color flow cytometry., From randomization to the clinical cutoff date. Maximum follow up was 54.41 months|Percentage of Participants With Overall Complete Response (CR) or Better, Percentage of participants achieving CR or better were reported. CR or better rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR or sCR based on the computerized algorithm, according to IMWG response criteria. IMWG 2011 criteria for CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas (PCs), and \<5% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR and normal FLC ratio, absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or 2 to 4 color flow cytometry., From randomization to the clinical cutoff date. Maximum follow up was 54.41 months|Progression-free Survival on the Next Line of Therapy (PFS2), Progression-free survival on the next line of therapy (PFS2) is defined as the time from randomization to progression on the next line of treatment or death, whichever comes first., From randomization to the clinical cutoff date. Maximum follow up was 54.41 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS), measured from the date of from randomization to the date the subject's death, From randomization to the clinical cutoff date. Maximum follow up was 54.41 months|Time to Response, Time to response (PR or better), time to CR/sCR are defined as the time from randomization to date of initial response (or initial CR/sCR), From randomization to the clinical cutoff date. Maximum follow up was 54.41 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response (PR or better), duration of CR, duration of sCR, and duration of MRD-negative status, are calculated from the date of the initial documentation of a response (PR or better), or CR or better, or sCR, or MRD-negative status to the date of the first documented evidence of disease progression, as defined in the IMWG criteria, whichever occurs first., From randomization to the clinical cutoff date.

Maximum follow up was 54.41 months|Determine the Incidence of Anti-daratumumab Antibodies (Immunogenicity) for All Subjects Who Receive at Least 1 Dose of Daratumumab and Determine the Incidence of Anti-rHuPH20 Antibodies, Immunogenicity of daratumumab serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to daratumumab and serum titer will also be determined from confirmed positive samples using validated immunoassay methods. Other immunogenicity analyses (eg, assessment of neutralizing capabilities) may be performed to further characterize the immune responses that are generated.
