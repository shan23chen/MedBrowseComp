NCT00355108,ATERO : A Randomised Study With Tranexamic Acid in Epistaxis of Rendu Osler Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00355108,,COMPLETED,"Scientific Objectives Primary objective : Demonstrate that oral intake of tranexamic acid significantly reduces the risk of epistaxis occurrence, estimated by the average monthly duration of episodes of epistaxis.

Secondary objectives :

* Document the benefit of tranexamic acid on the amount of haemoglobine and quality of life of patients.
* Identify scalable and genetic factors of response to the treatment by tranexamic acid.
* Describe compliance and tolerance of the treatment. Method Experimental Design We suggest the realisation of a randomised comparative clinical trial versus placebo, with a crossover of random alternated periods of three months over a total of six months.

Study Population 213 affected patients, displaying sufficiently invalidating epistaxis to require a basal treatment, will be recruited and followed every 3 months. Recruitment will lean on teams who are part of the national French network in close collaboration with the reference centre for the Rendu-Osler disorder, appointed to Lyon on the 19th of November 2004. Follow up of the study will be carried out by the Clinical Investigational Centre of the related towns.

Outcome measures The main criterion of efficacy is the average duration of epistaxis, the secondary criterion of efficacy is the average number of epistaxis measured per month. Tolerance will be analysed according to the occurrence of venal or arterial thrombosis and allergic accidents. Venal thrombosis will systematically be sought by an inferior limbs echodoppler. Response markers will be sought through modelisation incorporating environmental, phenotypic and genetic factors.",NO,"Telangiectasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic|Osler-Rendu Disease",DRUG: tranexamic acid,"The primary efficacy criterion is the average monthly duration of epistaxis., after first 3 month period treatment or placebo and after second 3 month period treatment or placebo","the average monthly number of epistaxis,, after first 3 month period treatment or placebo and after second 3 month period treatment or placebo|the average duration of one episode of epistaxis measured over a month,, after first 3 month period treatment or placebo and after second 3 month period treatment or placebo|the Haemoglobin level, after first 3 month period treatment or placebo and after second 3 month period treatment or placebo|estimation of Quality of life., over first 3 month period treatment or placebo and over second 3 month period treatment or placebo|Outcome of following Adverse Event: arterial or veinous thrombosis, allergic accident, during first 3 month period treatment or placebo and over second 3 month period treatment or placebo",,Hospices Civils de Lyon,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,170,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2005.405,2006-09,2010-05,2010-05,2006-07-21,,2019-05-28,"Henri PLAUCHU, Lyon, 69002, France",
