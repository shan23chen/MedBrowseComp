The date of progression was date of the last observation or radiological assessment of target lesions that either showed a predefined increase (≥20%) in the sum of the target lesions or the appearance of new non-target lesions.

The severity was graded based on the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03. An AE that met one or more of the following outcomes was classified as serious:

* Fatal
* Life-threatening
* Disabling/incapacitating
* Results in hospitalization or prolongs a hospital stay
* A congenital abnormality
* Other important medical events may also be considered serious AEs if they may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, First dose date up to last follow-up (maximum up to 30.8 months)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life (QoL), it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status indicate a better quality of life; a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. Lower scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a better quality of life; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement., Baseline; End of Treatment (EOT) (up to 29.6 months)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing the Worst Laboratory Abnormalities Grade 3 or 4 Post-Baseline, Blood samples were collected for hematology, serum chemistry and the laboratory abnormalities were assessed. The most severe graded abnormality observed post-baseline for each graded test was counted for each participant. Safety as assessed by grading of laboratory values and AEs according to the National Cancer Institutes' Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) covering grades 0-5 (0=Normal, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Life-threatening, 5=Death). The percentage of participants with worst postbaseline grades 3 or 4 are reported., First dose date up to last follow-up (maximum up to 30.8 months)",,Gilead Sciences,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,529,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IMMU-132-05|2017-003019-21,2017-11-07,2020-03-30,2020-12-08,2015-10-12,2021-04-30,2022-06-15,"Southern Cancer Center, 29653 Anchor Cross Blvd, Daphne, Alabama, 36526, United States|Souther Cancer Center, 3719 Dauphin St., 5 Floor, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Southern Cancer Center, 3 Mobile Infirmary Circle, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Southern Cancer Center, 6701 Airport Blvd., Bldg B, Terace Level, Mobile, Alabama, 36608, United States|Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona, 85054, United States|Mayo Clinic Hospital, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1411 S.
