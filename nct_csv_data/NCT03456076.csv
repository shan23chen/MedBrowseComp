NCT03456076,A Study Comparing Adjuvant Alectinib Versus Adjuvant Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Patients With ALK Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03456076,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label, Phase III study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of alectinib compared with platinum-based in the adjuvant setting. Participants in the experimental arm will receive alectinib at 600 mg orally twice daily (BID) taken with food for 24 months.

Participants in the control arm will receive one of the protocol specified platinum based chemotherapy regimens for 4 cycles. Following treatment completion, participants will be followed up for their disease until disease recurrence. At the time of disease recurrence, participants will enter a survival follow-up until death, withdrawal of consent or study closure, whichever occurs earlier.",YES,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",DRUG: Alectnib|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin,"Disease-free Survival (DFS), as Assessed by the Investigator, DFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first documented recurrence of disease or new primary NSCLC as determined by the investigator through use of an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy sample results (if clinically feasible), and clinical status or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Approximately 58 months","Overall Survival (OS), Primary OS analysis at approximately 5 years after FPI and final OS analysis at approximately 8 years after FPI.

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Until 28 days after the last dose of alectinib (up to 2 years) or 28 days after end of last cycle of chemotherapy (up to 4 cycles)|AEs Grade 3-5 With a Difference in Incidence Rate of at Least 2% Between Treatment Arms, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.
