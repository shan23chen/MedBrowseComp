NCT01520909,"Study of a New Medication for Childhood Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), a Blood Disorder of Low Platelet Counts That Can Lead to Bruising Easily, Bleeding Gums, and/or Bleeding Inside the Body.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01520909,PETIT2,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in children with previously treated chronic immune thrombocytopenia who are between 1 and 17 years of age. This is a 2 part study. In part 1, patients will be randomized to receive either eltrombopag or placebo for 13 weeks. All patients who complete part 1 will enter part 2. In part 2, all patients will receive 24 weeks of eltrombopag.",YES,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,DRUG: Eltrombopag|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants Achieving a Platelet Count >=50 Giga Cells Per Liter (Gi/L) for at Least 6 Out of 8 Weeks, Between Weeks 5 and 12 of Part 1, Participants who achieved a platelet count \>=50 Gi/L for at least 6 out of 8 weeks, between Weeks 5 and 12 of Part 1, were reported., From Week 5 up to Week 12 of Part 1","Percentage of Responders, Percentage of participants who responded (defined as platelet count \>= 50 Gi/L in absence of rescue) at least once up to week 12 of Part 1 (Odds of achieving a platelet count \>=50 Gi/L during the first 12 weeks of Part 1), From Week 1 up to Week 12 of Part 1|Number of Participants Achieving a Platelet Count >=50 Gi/L at Any Time During the First 12 Weeks of Part 1, Participants who achieved a platelet count \>=50 Gi/L at any time during the first 12 weeks of Part 1 were reported., From Baseline up to Week 12 of Part 1|Number of Participants Achieving a Platelet Count >=50 Gi/L at Any Time During the First 6 Weeks of Part 1, Participants who achieved a platelet count \>=50 Gi/L at any time during the first 6 weeks of Part 1 were reported., From Baseline up to Week 6 of Part 1|Weighted Mean Platelet Count, The weighted mean platelet count is defined as ""the area under the platelet-time curve divided by the duration of the study (12 weeks)"". Weighted mean platelet counts from baseline to week 12 of the randomized period was compared between placebo and eltrombopag using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline platelet count and age cohort. For each subject the area between two adjacent visits with platelet counts was calculated. The area was calculated for all pairs of adjacent visits starting at Day 1 of randomized period and then the total sum of all the areas was divided by the total duration of time during the randomized period. For each subject, this method calculates an 'average' platelet count and it allows the possibility that subjects may have had different number of assessments during different times relative to baseline., Baseline and Week 12 of Part 1|Maximum Duration for Which a Participant Continuously Maintained a Platelet Count of >=50 Gi/L During the First 12 Weeks of Part 1, The maximum duration for which a participant continuously maintained a platelet count \>=50 Gi/L was calculated and summarized for the first 12 weeks of Part 1. Participants with non-weekly assessments were assumed to have maintained a positive response for each week between two assessments that had positive responses. If a participant achieved a positive response at an assessment and then achieved a negative response at the next assessment, then it was assumed that the participant had achieved a positive response for one day., From Baseline up to Week 12 of Part 1|Number of Participants Who Required a Protocol-defined Rescue Treatment During Part 1, Rescue treatment is defined as either a new immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) medication, an increase in the dose of a concomitant ITP medication from Baseline, a platelet transfusion, or a splenectomy., From Baseline up to Week 12 of Part 1|Number of Participants With Any Bleeding and Significant Bleeding as Assessed Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale During Part 1, The WHO Bleeding Scale is a measure of bleeding severity with the following grades: Grade 0=no bleeding; Grade 1=petechiae; Grade 2=mild blood loss; Grade 3=gross bleeding; Grade 4=debilitating blood loss.
