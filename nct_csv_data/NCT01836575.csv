NCT01836575,Alimta® Versus Its Combination With Carboplatin in Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer in Patients Performance Status 2,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01836575,PS2,COMPLETED,"Optimal management of patients with advanced NSCLC and with PS 2 remains controversial and underrepresented in clinical trials, typically accounting for 5 to 10% of enrolled patients. Patient PS 2 proportion in population-based studies is considerably higher than that included in clinical trials. Management of patients with PS of 2 in clinical practice is empirical and inconsistent. Patients have median overall survival of 3 to 5 months in randomized trials, and treatment options include best supportive care, single-agent and combination chemotherapy. Retrospective studies have suggested that patients PS 2 may benefit from first-line chemotherapy in terms of symptom improvement and overall survival. In many of these studies, single-agent chemotherapy was compared with best supportive care alone. Data on the role of cisplatin-based combinations for patients with PS 2 is more scant, with one study questioning its benefit, and another interrupting accrual because of undue toxicity. With regards to carboplatin, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study 9730 compared paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel alone in a subgroup of 107 patients with PS 2; the median overall survival was significantly longer in group treated with combination chemotherapy (4.7 versus 2.4 months). Combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel also produced a statistically significantly higher incidence of severe hematological and non-hematological toxicities. On the basis of aforementioned results, a recent European panel stated that carboplatin-based or low-dose cisplatin-based doublets might represent alternative options to single-agent chemoterapy in patients PS 2. Outside clinical trials, single-agent chemotherapy with a 3rd generation agent remains valid option for patients PS2. Results demonstrate that pemetrexed is an agent with established single-agent activity in NSCLC, and suggest it is a potential candidate for combinations with platinum and other agents currently utilized for patients with advanced NSCLC. Favorable toxicity profile of pemetrexed suggests that this agent is an ideal candidate for single agent testing and in combination among patients with PS 2. Substantial doubt remains in the comparative benefit from monotherapy versus combination. Starting dose and schedule of pemetrexed were set for this study based on its current labeling in the 2nd line treatment of metastatic NSCLC and 1st line treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.",NO,Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin,"Overall survival, Each patient will be followed from inclusion date in the study (ICF signature) until the death date for any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to one year after completion of study treatment. Primary objective of this study is to determine and compare the overall survival produced by pemetrexed as a single-agent and by the combination of pemetrexed plus carboplatin in a patient with previously untreated, advanced non-squamous NSCLC and an ECOG Performance status of 2., From ICF signature date until e until death date for any cause","Safety evaluation, Planned interim analysis for the 46 death events, and cut off for patients at V3 to V6, every 06 months as average. Patients with at least any study treatment dose were included in safety analyses, focused on toxicity grades 3-4. Toxicity evaluation from date of last treatment dose until 1 month of follow up visit date, and every cycle according CTCAE v3.0 for study dose adjustment as per guidelines based on episodes of febrile neutropenia; grade 4 thrombocytopenia and/or bleeding; and any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity except nausea/emesis. Safety evaluation for medical conditions, symptoms or signs, laboratory parameters as per protocol criteria, disregarding disease progression when unrelated drugs or any procedure of study., Serious Adverse Event every 6 months|Progression free survival, Progression free survival evaluated by RECIST criteria, as described in protocol. Time for Progression free survival will be measured from date of first treatment dose to either date a patient is first recorded as disease progression (even for a withdrawn patient due to toxicity), or the date of death due to any causes before progression. Patient lost of follow up will be censored from the last contact date. Patients starting new treatment before disease progression will be censored at that date of starting new treatment. A patient who dies without disease progression the time for this assessment will be last follow-up date., Final data analysis: Sep/2012|Response Rate, Objective response rate evaluated by RECIST criteria as described in protocol. From those patients with tumoral response, the duration of response is measured from the date of first response evidence (Complete and Partial Responses) until first recorded as disease progression, or date of death to any causes before progression. Duration for tumoral response will be censored in the last follow up date for those patients with tumoral response who still alive and has not progressed., Final data analysis: Sep/2012",,"Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Brazil",Eli Lilly and Company,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,228,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,H3E-BL-O027-PS2|H3E - US -I023|INCA-Lung001,2008-04,2012-01,2012-12,2013-04-22,,2013-04-22,"The Mount Sinai Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami Beach, Florida, 33140, United States|Instituto do Câncer do Ceará - ICC, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil|Hospital Lifecenter, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil|Hospital Caridade de Ijuí - CACON, Ijuí, RS, Brazil|Hospital São Lucas, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil|Centro de Pesquisas Oncológicas - CEPON, Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil|Hospital Amaral Carvalho, Jaú, São Paulo, Brazil|INCA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Instituto do Câncer Arnaldo Vieira de Carvalho, São Paulo, Brazil",
