NCT00626990,Phase III Trial of Anaplastic Glioma Without 1p/19q Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00626990,CATNON,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving temozolomide during and/or after radiation therapy is more effective than radiation therapy alone in treating anaplastic glioma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving temozolomide during and/or after radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to radiation therapy alone in treating patients with anaplastic glioma.",YES,Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors,DRUG: temozolomide|GENETIC: DNA methylation analysis|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|RADIATION: radiation therapy,"Overall Survival as Measured From the Day of Randomization, The duration of survival is the time interval between randomization and the date of death due to any cause. Patients not reported dead or lost to follow up will be censored at the date of the last follow up examination., from date from enrollment till the date of death (time till death is up to 10.9 years after patient enrollment in the study)","Progression-free Survival, Disease progression is defined as radiological or neurological/clinical progression (whichever occurs first); progression free survival (PFS) is the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death whichever occurs first. If neither event has been observed, the patient is censored at the date of the last follow up examination. Radiological progression was defined as increase of contrast enhancing area on MRI or CT scans of more than 25% as measured by two perpendicular diameters compared to the smallest measurements ever recorded for the same lesion by the same technique. The appearance of new lesions with or without contrast enhancement Neurological/clinical progression was defined as:decrease in WHO performance status,deterioration of neurological functions,appearance of signs/symptoms of increased intracranial pressure,and/or start of corticosteroid or increase of corticosteroid dosage by 50% for control of neurological symptoms., from randomization till the date of disease progression or death (time till death is up to 10.9 years after patient enrollment in the study)|Quality of Life of the Patient, Quality of life was assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) version 3 and the Brain Cancer Module-20, from 14 days prior to randomization till five years or death (time till death is up to 10.9 years after patient enrollment in the study)|Neurological Deterioration Free Survival, Neurological deterioration is defined as a decrease in WHO performance status as follows:

decrease in WHO performance status

* for patients with baseline WHO performance status 0: deterioration to WHO performance status 2 or worse for which no other explanation is present, and which is maintained for at least three months
* for patients with baseline WHO performance status 1 or 2: deterioration to WHO performance status 3 or worse for which no other explanation is present and which is maintained for at least three months

The date of neurological deterioration will be the first date the persistent decrease in performance status was diagnosed. Neurological deterioration free progression is the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of neurological deterioration or death whichever occurs first. If neither event has been observed, the patient is censored at the date of the last follow up examination, within 2 weeks of randomization; during radiotherapy at week 4 and 6; 4 weeks after the end of radiotherapy; Six monthly after the end of radiotherapy; Prior to each cycle of adjuvant therapy; Every six months after the documentation of first progression.",,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,NCIC Clinical Trials Group|Radiation Therapy Oncology Group|Medical Research Council|Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,751,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EORTC-26053-22054|NCIC CTG CEC.1|RTOG-0834|2006-001533-17|P04839|MRC BR14,2007-12,2018-09-05,2029-12,2008-02-29,2023-09-11,2023-09-11,"Arizona Oncology Services Foundation, Phoenix, Arizona, United States|Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States|UCSF University of California San Francisco Medical Center-Mount Zion, San Francisco, California, United States|University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States|Mayo Clinic in Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, United States|Florida Hospital, Orlando, Florida, United States|Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States|Memorial Health University Medical Center, Savannah, Georgia, United States|Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, United States|Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, United States|Oncology Associates PC, Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States|Parkview Hospital, Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States|Saint Vincent Oncology Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States|McFarland Clinic, Ames, Iowa, 50010, United States|June E.
