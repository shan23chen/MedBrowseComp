NCT03575351,"A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of JCAR017 to Standard of Care in Adult Subjects With High-risk, Transplant-eligible Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03575351,TRANSFORM,COMPLETED,"The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center trial in adult subjects with Relapsed or refractory (R/R) aggressive Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to compare safety and efficacy between the standard of care (SOC) strategy versus JCAR017 (also known as lisocabtagene maraleucel or liso-cel). Subjects will be randomized to either receive SOC (Arm A) or to receive JCAR017 (Arm B).

All subjects randomized to Arm A will receive Standard of care (SOC) salvage therapy (R-DHAP, RICE or R-GDP) as per physician's choice before proceeding to High dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Subjects from Arm A may be allowed to cross over and receive JCAR017 upon confirmation of an EFS event.

Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive Lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy followed by JCAR017 infusion.",NO,"Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin",DRUG: Standard of Care|GENETIC: JCAR017,"Event-free survival (EFS), Time from randomization to death from any cause, progressive disease (PD), failure to achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or start of new antineoplastic therapy due to efficacy concerns, whichever occurs first, Approximately 3 years","Complete response rate (CRR), Percentage of subjects achieving a complete response (CR), Approximately 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from randomization to PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization to time of death due to any cause, Approximately 4.5 years|Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of subjects achieving an objective response of partial response (PR) or better according to the Lugano Classification as assessed by IRC review, Approximately 3 years|Duration of response (DOR), Time from first response to disease progression, start of new antineoplastic therapy due to efficacy concerns or death from any cause, Approximately 3 years|PFS on next line of treatment (PFS-2), Time from randomization to second objective disease progression or death from any cause, whichever is first., Approximately 3 years|Adverse Events (AEs), Type, frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAE), and laboratory abnormalities (overall and in clinical, histological and molecular subgroups), Approximately 3 years|HRQoL using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life C30 questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life C30 questionnaire: The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be used as a measure of health-related quality of life, fatigue, physical and cognitive functions., Approximately 3 years|HRQoL parameters assessed by FACT-Lym ""Additional concerns"" subscale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma ""Additional concerns"" subscale: Only the LYM subscale will be administered in this study.
