NCT01847274,A Maintenance Study With Niraparib Versus Placebo in Patients With Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01847274,,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of niraparib as maintenance in platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients who have either gBRCAmut or a tumor with high-grade serous histology and who have responded to their most recent chemotherapy containing a platinum agent. Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor. Niraparib or placebo (in a 2:1 ratio) will be administered once daily continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI), European Quality of Life scale, 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), and a neuropathy questionnaire. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of niraparib as maintenance therapy in patients who have platinum sensitive ovarian cancer as assessed by the prolongation of progression free survival (PFS).",YES,Ovarian Neoplasms|Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer,DRUG: Active comparator: Niraparib|DRUG: placebo,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Cohort With Germline BReast CAncer Gene (BRCA) Mutation (gBRCA), PFS was defined as the time between randomization and disease progression or death from any cause. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to assess disease progression was performed at baseline, every 8 weeks through cycle 14, and then every 12 weeks until treatment discontinuation. The objective assessment of disease progression was determined by means of central radiologic and clinical review, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),version 1.1, which was performed in a blinded fashion.

For the second, CIPN was assigned if a participant recorded a score greater than 1 (""a little bit"")., Up to 7 years, 7 months and 4 days|Number of Participants With Concordance of a Candidate Companion BRAC Analysis Diagnostic Test Compared to the Centralized BRCA Mutation Test Used in This Study, This will never be analyzed since the data for the candidate companion BRAC analysis diagnostic test was not collected which was to be compared with centralized BRCA mutation test used in this study., Up to 7 years, 7 months and 4 days|Number of Participants With Concordance of a Candidate Companion HRD Diagnostic Test Compared to the HRD Test Used in This Study, This will never be analyzed since the data for the candidate companion HRD diagnostic test was not collected which was to be compared with HRD test used in this study., Up to 7 years, 7 months and 4 days|Number of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a participants or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
