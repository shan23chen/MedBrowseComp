The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a questionnaire that measures lung cancer-specific disease and treatment symptoms. It includes questions about specific symptoms in which participants respond based on a 4-point scale, where 1 is ""not at all"" and 4 is ""very much"". Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A lower score indicates an improvement in symptoms., Baseline to Cycle 5; each cycle is 21 days|European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status, Least squares mean change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life score between tislelizumab arms and paclitaxel + carboplatin arm. The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 is a questionnaire that assesses quality of life of cancer patients. It includes global health status and quality of life questions related to overall health in which participants respond based on a 7-point scale, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A higher score indicates better health outcomes., Baseline to Cycle 5; each cycle is 21 days|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), which includes laboratory tests, physical exams, electrocardiogram results and vital signs, according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, From first dose to 30 days after the last dose (up to approximately 4 years and 9 months)",,BeiGene,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,360,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,BGB-A317-307|CTR20180292,2018-07-30,2020-09-30,2023-04-28,2018-07-20,2023-10-17,2024-10-26,"Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, 230000, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230000, China|Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, 100021, China|Beijing Cancer Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100142, China|Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100730, China|Chinese Pla General Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100853, China|Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, Beijing, 101149, China|The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400010, China|Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400038, China|Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400042, China|Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, Chongqing, 404000, China|Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350014, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China|Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China|Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, 515031, China|The Peoples Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China|The Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Zunyi, Guizhou, 563000, China|Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150000, China|Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450000, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450052, China|Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430022, China|Hubei Cancer Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, 430079, China|The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China|Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, 410013, China|General Hospital of Eastern Theater Command, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210002, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215006, China|Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, 221000, China|The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China|Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110042, China|The First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, Shaanxi, 710061, China|Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China|Jinan Central Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, 250013, China|Jinan Military General Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, 250031, China|Shandong Cancer Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, 250117, China|Weifang Peoples Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, 261000, China|Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200030, China|West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China|Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, Tianjin, 300052, China|Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, Tianjin, 300060, China|The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, China|Hangzhou First Peoples Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, China|Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310016, China|Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310022, China","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/47/NCT03594747/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/47/NCT03594747/SAP_001.pdf"
