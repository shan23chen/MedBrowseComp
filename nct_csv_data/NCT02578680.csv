NCT02578680,Study of Pemetrexed+Platinum Chemotherapy With or Without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With First Line Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-189/KEYNOTE-189),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02578680,,COMPLETED,"This is an efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy versus pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone in participants with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab combined with pemetrexed/platinum (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin), OR pemetrexed/platinum (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin).

With Amendment 10 (effective date 23-Dec-2019), active participants, investigator, and sponsor personnel or delegate(s) involved in the treatment administration or clinical evaluation of the participants will be unblinded, and all participants in the 'control' arm will discontinue saline placebo.

With Amendment 11 (effective date 31-Jan-2022), once the study objectives have been met or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and will be enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.

The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy prolongs Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) compared to pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone.",YES,Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab 200 mg|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Folic acid 350-1000 μg|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Vitamin B12 1000 μg|DRUG: Dexamethasone 4 mg|DRUG: Saline solution,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Central Imaging, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 21 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the interim analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. The OS is presented., Up to approximately 21 months","Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Central Imaging, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented., Up to approximately 21 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Central Imaging, For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until PD or death. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was to be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. DOR assessments were based on blinded central imaging review with confirmation. The DOR per RECIST 1.1 for all participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR is presented., Up to approximately 21 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this study drug. The number of participants who experienced an AE is presented., Up to approximately 21 months (Serious AEs: Up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment; Other AEs: Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Any Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this study drug. The number of participants who discontinued any randomized study drug due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 21 months","Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator Immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) Response Criteria, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented immune-related progressive disease (irPD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per irRECIST, irPD was confirmed if any of the following are observed in 2 scans performed at least 4 weeks apart: target lesion sum of diameters remains ≥20 % and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir; non-target disease resulting in initial PD is qualitatively worse; new lesion resulting in initial irPD is qualitatively worse; additional new lesion(s) since last evaluation; or additional new non-target lesion progression since last evaluation.
