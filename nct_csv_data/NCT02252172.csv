PR is defined as \>=50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours. If the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required. A \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., From randomization to disease progression, death, subsequent anti-myeloma therapy, withdrawal of consent to study participation or CCO whichever occurs first (up to 7.8 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was measured from the date of randomization to the date of the death., From randomization to death, withdrawal of consent to study participation or CCO whichever occurs first (up to 7.8 years)|Time to Disease Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of PD based on computerized algorithm as per IMWG criteria, or death due to PD., From randomization to disease progression, death, subsequent anti-myeloma therapy, withdrawal of consent to study participation or CCO whichever occurs first (up to 7.8 years)|Time to Response, Time to response is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first efficacy evaluation that met criteria for PR or better based on computerized algorithm as per IMWG criteria. PR: \>=50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours. If the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria; If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow PCs is required. A \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., From randomization to first response (PR or better) (up to 7.8 years)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of initial response (PR or better) to the date of PD, based on computerized algorithm as per IMWG criteria., From first response (PR of better) to disease progression, death, subsequent anti-myeloma therapy, withdrawal of consent to study participation or CCO whichever occurs first (up to 7.8 years)|Time to Subsequent Anti-myeloma Treatment, Time to subsequent anti-myeloma treatment is defined as the time from randomization to the start of first line of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment or death, whichever occurs first., From randomization to start of first subsequent anti-myeloma treatment, death, withdrawal of consent to study participation or CCO whichever is first (up to 7.8 years)|Progression-free Survival on Next Line of Therapy (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to progression on the first line of subsequent anti-myeloma therapy or death, whichever occurs first.

Questionnaire includes 28 items with 4-point Likert type responses from ""1-not at all"" to ""4-very much"" to assess functioning and symptoms; 2 items with 7-point Likert scales (1= poor and 7= excellent) for global health and overall health related QoL. Scores are transformed to 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing better GHS, better functioning, and more symptoms. Negative change from baseline values shows deterioration in quality of life or functioning and reduction in symptom and positive values indicate improvement and worsening of symptoms., Baseline and Day 1 of Cycle 3, 6, 9 and 12 (each Cycle of 28 days)|Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to Day 1 of Cycle 3, 6, 9 and 12, EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state., Baseline and Day 1 of Cycle 3, 6, 9 and 12 (each Cycle of 28 days)|Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score to Day 1 of Cycle 3, 6, 9 and 12, EQ-5D-5L is standardized, participant-reported questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and EQ-5D-5L VAS. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system provides a profile of participant's health state 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The participant was asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. Responses to the 5-dimension scores were combined and converted into single preference-weighted health utility index score 0 (0.0- worst health state) to 1 (1.0- better health state) representing the general health status of individual (but allows for values less than 0 by United kingdom \[UK\] scoring algorithm)., Baseline and Day 1 of Cycle 3, 6, 9 and 12 (each Cycle of 28 days)",,"Janssen
