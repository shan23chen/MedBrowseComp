NCT01121393,BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) vs Gemcitabine-cisplatin in 1st Line Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01121393,,COMPLETED,To investigate the efficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 compared to standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR activating mutation,YES,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Adenocarcinoma",DRUG: Gemcitabine+Cisplatin|DRUG: BIBW 2992,"Progression-free Survival, The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by central independent review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression or death whichever occurs earlier. A pre-defined set of censoring rules were used for patients who did not have a PFS.

Only data collected up until the analysis cut-off date (27 December 2013) were considered. Median time results from unstratified Kaplan-Meier estimates., Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 168","Objective Response (OR), OR is defined as a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by central independent review according to RECIST version 1.1 and will be presented as the percentage of patients with OR.

CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions and no new lesions.

PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD, non-Progressive Disease or non evaluation of all non-target lesions and no new lesions.

(Exact 95% Confidence interval by Clopper and Pearson.), Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 374|Disease Control (DC), DC is defined as a patient with objective response (OR) or stable disease (SD) assessed by central independent review according to RECIST version 1.1 and will be presented as the percentage of patients with DC., Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 374|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomisation to death. For patients who had not died until 7 December 2017, the date they were last known to be alive was derived from patient status records, the trial completion record, radiological imaging assessments, the study treatment termination record, and the randomisation date.

Median time results from unstratified Kaplan-Meier estimates., From randomisation up to 374 weeks|Time to Objective Response (OR), OR is defined as a best of overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by central independent review according to RECIST version 1.1.

For patients with an objective response, time to objective response was defined as the time from randomisation to the first objective response.

Outcome data are the percentage of patients with OR by each scheduled tumour assessment., Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 374|Duration of Objective Response, OR is defined as a best of overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by central independent review according to RECIST version 1.1.

For patients with an objective response, duration of objective response was defined as the time from the first objective response to disease progression or death whichever occurs earlier. A pre-defined set of censoring rules were used for patients who did not progress/die. The Median values are Kaplan-Meier estimates., Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 374|Duration of Disease Control, For patients with disease control, duration of disease control was defined as the time from randomisation to progression or death whichever occurs first. A pre-defined set of censoring rules were used for patients who did not progress/die. The Median values are Kaplan-Meier estimates., Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 374|Tumour Shrinkage, Tumour shrinkage is calculated as the minimum post-baseline sum of longest diameters of target lesions (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) (SLD), as assessed by central independent review. The mean of these minimum values are presented after adjusting for baseline sum of longest diameters and EGFR mutation category. Only data collected up until the analysis cut-off date (27 Dec 2013) were considered. A negative value means the smallest post-baseline SLD was smaller than baseline (decreased since baseline); a positive value means tumor size increased since baseline.

The means are adjusted for baseline sum of lesions and EGFR mutation category., Tumour assessment were performed at screening, week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 and then every 12 weeks until progression or death whichever occurs first up to week 374|Change From Baseline in Body Weight, The change from baseline to the lowest and the last body weight recorded or during the the study., Baseline and throughout the study (every 3 weeks) until progression or death (whichever occurs first) up to 374 weeks.|Change From Baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS), The last ECOG performance score category recorded during the study.
