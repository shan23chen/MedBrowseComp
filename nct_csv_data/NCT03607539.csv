Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD, Trough Database Cutoff Date of 15-Nov-2019 (Up to approximately 16 months)","Overall Survival (OS), The analysis population consisted of all randomized participants., Trough Database Cutoff Date of 15-Nov-2019 (Up to approximately 16 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by IRRC Assessment, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed CR (disappearance of all lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters \[SOD\] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD) according to RECIST 1.1, which was modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The percentage of participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by IRC was reported as the ORR, Trough Database Cutoff Date of 15-Nov-2019 (Up to approximately 16 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR) by IRRC Assessment, Trough Database Cutoff Date of 15-Nov-2019 (Up to approximately 16 months)|Time to Response (TTR) by IRRC Assessment, TTR was defined as the time of participants from the first treatment administration to the first incidence of a confirmed CR (disappearance of all lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters \[SOD\] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD) according to RECIST 1.1, which was modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The time from first treatment administration to the first incidence of treatment response was reported as the TTR, Trough Database Cutoff Date of 15-Nov-2019 (Up to approximately 16 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) by IRRC Assessment, From time of first documented evidence of CR or PR trough Database Cutoff Date of 15-Nov-2019 (Up to approximately 16 months)",,Innovent Biologics (Suzhou) Co.
