NCT02162771,To Demonstrate Equivalence of Pharmacokinetics and Noninferiority of Efficacy for CT-P10 in Comparison With Rituxan,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02162771,rituximab,COMPLETED,"This study is a Phase 3 prospective, randomised, parallel-group, active controlled, double blind, multicentre, international study with 2 coprimary endpoints designed to demonstrate equivalence in pharmacokinetics (Part 1), as well as noninferiority in efficacy (Part 2), of CT-P10 to Rituxan when coadministered with CVP and to assess efficacy and safety in patients with advanced (stage III-IV) FL. Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will run in parallel.",YES,"Lymphoma, Follicular",BIOLOGICAL: Rituxan|BIOLOGICAL: CT-P10|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone,"Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve at Steady State (AUCtau), AUCtau: Area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve within a dosing interval at steady state.

PK sampling was done at pre-dose and 1 hour after the end of infusion (EOI) at Core Cycles 1-3 and 5-8. At Core Cycle 4 (i.e. steady state), intensive PK samplings were done as follows: predose, EOI, 1 hour after EOI, 24 hour after EOI, 168 hour after EOI, 336 hour after EOI, 504 hour after EOI. Lastly, one sample at any time of the end of treatment (EOT) 1 visit was obtained., Core Cycle 4 (Week 12)|Maximum Serum Concentration at Steady State (Cmax,ss), Cmax,ss: Maximum concentration of drug in plasma at steady state on administering a fixed dose at equal dosing intervals.

PK sampling was done at pre-dose and 1 hour after the end of infusion (EOI) at Core Cycles 1-3 and 5-8. At Core Cycle 4 (i.e. steady state), intensive PK samplings were done as follows: predose, EOI, 1 hour after EOI, 24 hour after EOI, 168 hour after EOI, 336 hour after EOI, 504 hour after EOI. Lastly, one sample at any time of the end of treatment (EOT) 1 visit was obtained., Core Cycle 4 (Week 12)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) According to the 1999 International Working Group (IWG) Criteria, ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best response of complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or partial response (PR) by central review.

Per 1999 IWG criteria, the disease status was assessed by using contrasted CT, and CR, CRu, and PR were defined as followings; CR=Disappearance of all clinical/radiographic evidence of disease: regression of lymph nodes to normal size, absence of B-symptoms, bone marrow involvement, and organomegaly, and normal LDH level; CRu=Regression of measurable disease: \>=75% decrease in SPD of target lesions and in each target lesions. no increase in the size of non-target lesions, neither new lesion nor organomegaly measured; PR=Regression of measurable disease: \>=50% decrease in SPD of target lesions and no evidence of disease progression., During the Core Study Period (up to 8 cycles; Week 24)","B-cell Kinetics (B-cell Depletion and Recovery), B-cell kinetics were demonstrated by median values of B-cell counts (Lower limit of quantification was 20 cells/uL)., Cycles 1 to 8 during the Core Study Period",,Celltrion,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,140,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CT-P10 3.3|2013-004493-96,2014-07-14,2016-01-12,2018-12-29,2014-06-13,2020-01-29,2020-01-29,,
