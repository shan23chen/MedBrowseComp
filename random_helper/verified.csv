*   **Trials Comparing the Monotherapies:**
    *   Several sources ([1, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13]) discuss the use of both LoDAC and azacitidine as monotherapies in AML, particularly for patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Some studies compare them directly or in combination with other agents.

*   **Indirect Comparisons & Combination Therapies:**
    *   Many trials investigate azacitidine in combination with other drugs (e.g., venetoclax) and compare this combination to azacitidine monotherapy. These trials indirectly provide some efficacy data relative to the monotherapy, but the focus isn't a head-to-head LoDAC vs. Azacitidine comparison.
    *   NCT03926624: This trial uses LoDAC and Azacitidine combination regimens as a control arm against DFP-10917 in AML patients who have relapsed/refractory AML.

*   **Relevant Trial with Azacitidine Arm:**
    *   NCT04229979: This trial has an azacitidine arm within its ""Best Available Therapy"" arm for patients with AML in second complete remission. It is a phase III trial.

Therefore, based on the available information, **NCT04229979** may be the closest relevant trial, as it includes an azacitidine arm for comparison against a new therapy in AML patients.

However, several studies and meta-analyses provide indirect comparisons and relevant information.

Here's a summary of findings from the search results:

*   **Indirect Comparisons & Meta-Analyses:** Several meta-analyses ([1], [6], [8]) compare Azacitidine (AZA) and Decitabine (DAC) indirectly by comparing each drug to conventional care regimens (CCR) or best supportive care (BSC). These analyses suggest:

    *   Both AZA and DAC improve overall response (OR) rate and overall survival (OS) compared to CCR ([1]).
    *   DAC may have a higher complete remission (CR) rate than AZA, but AZA may have lower toxicity ([1], [6]).
    *   AZA showed better AML-free survival, while DAC had a higher possibility of achieving better CR and ORR, and AZA had the possibility of obtaining better OS with lower toxicity. ([6]).
    *   One meta-analysis showed a survival benefit for AZA but not for DAC when compared to conventional care ([2]).
*   **Phase II Study:** One phase II study directly compared low doses of Decitabine and Azacitidine and found that Decitabine was more effective in patients with higher IPSS-R scores ([7]).
*   **Retrospective Study:** A recent retrospective study found that Azacitidine showed a statistically significant greater overall survival probability and reduced risk of death compared to Decitabine ([12]).

While I am unable to provide a single NCT ID that directly compares the efficacy of Azacitidine monotherapy to Decitabine monotherapy for Myelodysplastic syndrome, there is an ongoing clinical trial: NCT05883956. It is a phase 3b, randomized, open-label, double crossover study comparing treatment preference between oral decitabine/cedazuridine and azacitidine in adult patients with IPSS R intermediate myelodysplastic syndrome, low blast AML, IPSS intermediate-2 or high risk MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and is estimated to be completed in April 2025 ([3]).

    *   A study mentioned in one of the articles (though without a specific NCT ID) compares chlorambucil alone to chlorambucil and rituximab. This would be a more direct comparison of rituximab's added benefit.
*   **Trials of Rituximab monotherapy (without a direct observation arm):** These trials demonstrate the efficacy of rituximab on its own.

**Key Findings from the Trials:**

*   **Efficacy:** Some trials, like the one by the Italian GEMVIN Investigators and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, found that cisplatin-based regimens had a slightly longer median survival compared to gemcitabine/vinorelbine, but this difference wasn't always statistically significant.
*   **Toxicity/Quality of Life:** Gemcitabine/vinorelbine was generally less toxic than cisplatin-based chemotherapy, leading to fewer issues like myelosuppression, vomiting, alopecia, and ototoxicity. Some studies suggest that while overall quality of life wasn't improved with gemcitabine/vinorelbine, certain aspects (like appetite and reduced vomiting) were better.

**Possible Relevant Trials (without specific NCT IDs):**

However, here's a breakdown of relevant trials and how to potentially find the most useful one for *your* specific needs:

**Key Trials & Findings:**

*   **IROX (Irinotecan + Oxaliplatin) vs. Irinotecan Monotherapy:**
    *   Haller et al. conducted a randomized phase 3 trial (PMID: 11867748) comparing IROX to irinotecan alone as a second-line treatment for mCRC after failure of fluoropyrimidine therapy. The study showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with IROX compared to irinotecan alone (13.4 vs. 11.1 months). IROX also showed benefits in objective response rate (ORR) and time-to-progression (TTP).

*   **Irinotecan Monotherapy Efficacy:**
    *   Cunningham et al. reported a trial where irinotecan + supportive care resulted in significantly greater overall survival than supportive care alone in patients who progressed on 5-FU therapy.
    *   Rougier et al. compared irinotecan to continuous infusion of 5-FU in patients with mCRC whose disease progressed on first-line bolus 5-FU. Irinotecan monotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared to infusional 5-FU.

**How to Find a Specific Clinical Trial ID (NCT Number):**

1.  **Identify Key Search Terms:** Start with the specifics of what you're looking for. For example:
    *   ""Irinotecan monotherapy vs IROX colorectal cancer""
    *   ""Irinotecan oxaliplatin colorectal cancer clinical trial""
    *   ""Second-line treatment colorectal cancer irinotecan clinical trial""
2.  **Use Clinical Trial Databases:**
    *   **[clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov):** This is the primary US government database of clinical trials. Use the search terms you identified to find relevant trials. The NCT number will be prominently displayed for each trial.
    *   **PubMed:** Search PubMed using similar search terms. Clinical trial publications often include the NCT number.
3.  **Examine Trial Publications:** Once you find a relevant publication (like the Haller et al. study mentioned above), look for the clinical trial registration number. It's often included in the abstract or methods section.

**Example Search on ClinicalTrials.gov:**

If you were to search clinicaltrials.gov for ""Irinotecan IROX colorectal cancer"", you would likely find several trials. Examine the results to find trials that specifically compare the two regimens and match your patient population of interest.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Specific Patient Population:** The ""best"" trial for you might depend on the specific characteristics of the patient you're considering (e.g., prior treatments, performance status).
*   **Outcomes of Interest:** Decide which outcome is most important to you (e.g., overall survival, quality of life) and look for trials that focused on that outcome.

Here's why, and what I can offer:

*   **Lenalidomide is often studied in combination:** Many trials investigate lenalidomide *with* rituximab or other agents, rather than as a direct monotherapy comparison against observation alone.
*   **Focus on Maintenance:** Some studies examine lenalidomide as a *maintenance* therapy *after* initial treatment, compared to observation.
*   **Varying Endpoints:** Trials may have different primary endpoints (Progression-Free Survival, Overall Survival, etc.), making direct comparisons challenging.

However, here are some relevant trials and considerations based on the search results:

*   **NCT00910910 (mentioned in a 2013 article):** This trial, called the ""ORIGIN trial,"" evaluated lenalidomide as initial therapy for CLL patients 65 or older. The 2013 article noted higher death rates in the lenalidomide arm compared to chlorambucil. This trial suggests lenalidomide might not always be superior to other approaches.
*   **CLL-009 trial (NCT00963105):** A phase II trial that investigated the efficacy of lenalidomide in 103 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.
*   **A study mentioned in the ASH 2023:** A study involving CLL patients who did not yet need traditional treatment were given lenalidomide. The results from the study showed that many patients limited their CLL from progressing for years using lenalidomide and that using lenalidomide did not significantly increase the risk of developing other forms of cancer.

It's important to note that directly comparing observation to lenalidomide monotherapy might not be the most common research approach.

*   **NCT01197560:** This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of lenalidomide in patients with DLBCL.
*   **NCT02399085:** This is the L-MIND study, which investigated tafasitamab (an anti-CD19 antibody) *plus* lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory DLBCL. A key aspect of this trial is that a retrospective analysis (RE-MIND) compared the results to a real-world cohort receiving lenalidomide monotherapy. This might offer some indirect comparison data, even though it's not a randomized comparison to etoposide.
*   **NCT02911142:** This trial studies lenalidomide combined with a modified DA-EPOCH and rituximab in primary effusion lymphoma or KSHV-associated large cell lymphoma.
*   **NCT02628405:** A study of R-ICE and Lenalidomide for treating patients with first-relapse/primary refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

*A Phase 2/3 study compared Lenalidomide to investigator's choice in relapsed or refractory DLBCL (mentioned in multiple search results).* In this trial, the investigator's choice could be several agents, including etoposide in some cases, BUT it's not a direct, specified comparison.

*   **Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4127-37**: Phase 2/3 trial investigating lenalidomide versus investigator's choice (IC) in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

**Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific NCT ID that directly compares Etoposide monotherapy to Lenalidomide monotherapy**

*   **Sequencing:** Some trials examine docetaxel after paclitaxel resistance.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Many trials involve taxanes in combination with other drugs (e.g., carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab), which complicates direct comparisons of docetaxel vs. paclitaxel monotherapy.

It also highlights the complexities of comparing different histological types of NSCLC.
*   **Studies mentioned in source 1:** A phase IB study by Kanda et al. demonstrated that the combination of nivolumab with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab had the best effect, while nivolumab with cisplatin and pemetrexed achieved poorer results. Similarly, Rizvi et al. demonstrated the best efficacy for the combination of 5 mg/kg nivolumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel, with 2-year OS of 62% versus 33% for the combination of cisplatin with pemetrexed.

It's important to note:

*   Direct comparisons in Phase III studies are lacking (as stated in source 1).
*   Some studies focus on specific NSCLC subtypes (e.g., squamous vs. non-squamous).
*   The addition of Bevacizumab can also affect the results of the control arm.
