"A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial of chemotherapy plus epigenetic therapy with hydralazine valproate for advanced cervical cancer. Preliminary results. The reversing of epigenetic aberrations using the inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylases may have therapeutic value in cervical cancer. This is a randomized phase III, placebo-controlled study of hydralazine and valproate (HV) added to cisplatin topotecan in advanced cervical cancer. Patients received hydralazine at 182 mg for rapid, or 83 mg for slow acetylators, and valproate at 30 mg/kg, beginning a week before chemotherapy and continued until disease progression. Response, toxicity, and PFS were evaluated, and 36 patients (17 CT + HV and 19 CT + PLA) were included. The median number of cycles was 6. There were four PRs to CT + HV and one in CT + PLA. Stable disease in five (29%) and six (32%) patients, respectively, whereas eight (47%) and 12 (63%) showed progression (P = 0.27). At a median follow-up time of 7 months (1-22), the median PFS is 6 months for CT + PLA and 10 months for CT + HV (P = 0.0384, two tailed).

"Thalidomide-dexamethasone compared with melphalan-prednisolone in elderly patients with multiple myeloma. We compared thalidomide-dexamethasone (TD) with melphalan-prednisolone (MP) in 289 elderly patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Patients received either thalidomide 200 mg plus dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1 to 4 and 15 to 18 on even cycles and days 1 to 4 on odd cycles, during a 28-day cycle or to melphalan 0.25 mg/kg and prednisolone 2 mg/kg orally on days 1 to 4 during a 28- to 42-day cycle. Patients achieving stable disease or better were randomly assigned to maintenance therapy with either thalidomide 100 mg daily and 3 MU interferon alpha-2b thrice weekly or to 3 MU interferon alpha-2b thrice weekly only. TD resulted in a higher proportion of complete and very good remissions (26% vs 13%; P= .006) and overall responses (68% vs 50%; P= .002) compared with MP. Time to progression (21.2 vs 29.1 months; P= .2), and progression-free survival was similar (16.7 vs 20.7 months; P= .1), but overall survival was significantly shorter in the TD group (41.5 vs 49.4 months; P= .024). Toxicity was higher with TD, particularly in patients older than 75 years with poor performance status. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00205751.

Thalidomide maintenance treatment increases progression-free but not overall survival in elderly patients with myeloma. Thalidomide maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation resulted in increased progression-free survival and overall survival in a few trials, but its role in non-transplant eligible patients with multiple myeloma remains unclear. This study assessed the impact of thalidomide-interferon in comparison to interferon maintenance therapy in elderly patients with multiple myeloma. Of 289 elderly patients with multiple myeloma who were randomized to thalidomide-dexamethasone or melphalan-prednisolone induction therapy, 137 finally completed 9 cycles of induction therapy with stable disease or better and thereby qualified for maintenance treatment. Of these, 128 have been randomized to either thalidomide-interferon or interferon alone. Primary study endpoints were progression-free survival and response rates; secondary endpoints were overall survival, toxicity and quality of life. Thalidomide-interferon maintenance therapy led to a significantly longer progression-free survival compared to interferon (27.7 vs. 13.2 months, P=0.0068), but overall survival was similar in both groups (52.6 vs. 51.4 months, P=0.81) and did not differ between patients aged 75 years or older, or younger patients (P=0.39). Survival after disease progression tended to be shorter in patients on thalidomide-interferon maintenance therapy (P=0.056). Progression-free survival and overall survival tended to be shorter in patients with adverse cytogenetic (FISH) findings compared to the standard risk group but differences were not significant (P=0.084 and P=0.082, respectively). Patients on thalidomide-interferon presented with more neuropathy (P=0.0015), constipation (P=0.0004), skin toxicity (P=0.0041) and elevated creatinine (P=0.026). Thalidomide plus interferon maintenance therapy increased progression-free survival but not overall survival and was associated with slightly more toxicity than maintenance with interferon alone.

"Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Study of Tasquinimod in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. Tasquinimod, a novel oral therapy targeting the tumor microenvironment, significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This phase III study was conducted to confirm the phase II results and to detect an overall survival (OS) benefit. Men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC and evidence of bone metastases were assigned (2:1) to receive tasquinimod once per day or placebo until progression or toxicity. The primary end point was radiographic PFS (rPFS; time from random assignment to radiologic progression or death) per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria and RECIST 1.1. The study had 99.9% power to detect an rPFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6 with a two-sided alpha error of .05 and 80% power to detect a target HR of 0.8 for OS, the key secondary end point. In all, 1,245 patients were randomly assigned to either tasquinimod (n = 832) or placebo (n = 413) between March 2011 and December 2012 at 241 sites in 37 countries. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups: median age, 71 years; Karnofsky performance status ≥ 90%, 77.3%; and visceral metastases, 21.1%. Estimated median rPFS by central review was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.8 to 8.2 months) with tasquinimod and 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 5.5 months) with placebo (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.75; P < .001). Median OS was 21.3 months (95% CI, 19.5 to 23.0 months) with tasquinimod and 24.0 months (95% CI, 21.4 to 26.9 months) with placebo (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.28; P = .25). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were more frequent with tasquinimod (42.8% v 33.6%), the most common being anemia, fatigue, and cancer pain. In chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC, tasquinimod significantly improved rPFS compared with placebo.
